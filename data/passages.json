You grab the strap of your backpack with one hand and smooth out your shirt with the other. The air carries the bite that only autumn really has, cool enough to remind you that summer is over. You breath in, catching the earthy smell of dry leaves scattered on the ground. The neighborhood is quiet, other than the soft rustle of branches when the wind blows.\n\nThe colors in the trees remind you just how quickly time moves. It's the first day of school, something you've done plenty of times before in your eighteen years of living, but this one feels different. It's senior year. The last chapter of high school. The thought sends a buzz of excitement through you, mixed with a nervous knot in your stomach that you can't quite shake.\n\nYour shoes tap a steady rhythm on the pavement as you walk. Your mind drifts to everything this year will hold. The last first day, the last set of classes, the last stupid school event. It's a bitersweet thought.\n\nSuddenly, the quiet is broken by a loud and familiar voice.\n\n\"Wait up, !\" \n\nYou turn just in time to see Luke jogging toward you. His curls are a mess and his cheeks are flushed like he ran the whole way without thinking twice. There's that same wide, easy grin he always wears—like the world's never given him a reason not to. He slings an arm over your shoulder without missing a beat, almost as if this day wouldn't make sense if he didn't.\n\n\"Ready for the first day of school?\" he asks.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n You can click on the arrow below the game's title in the header to access your stats, relationships, and appearance.\n \n\n[Choice: Of course]\n[Choice: Not really]",

Your fingers find the screen, silencing the alarm with a clumsy tap.\n\nFor a moment, you just lie there, staring up at the ceiling and letting the remnants of sleep drain from your body. The early morning light filters in through the blinds, casting thin stripes across the walls. You exhale slowly, then swing your legs over the side of the bed, feet hitting the floor with a quiet thud.\n\nRubbing your eyes, you shuffle over to your desk. Your planner sits propped against the side of your monitor, and you see the day is clear—perfect for following up on the one thing that's been stuck in your mind since yesterday: Madame Serena. If anything weird really did happen, the festival might still hold the answers you need.\n\nYou move toward the full-length mirror mounted beside your wardrobe. As you pass your desk, you catch your reflection out of the corner of your eye.\n\nYou pause.\n\nYour hair is a mess, flattened on one side and sticking up on the other. You run your fingers through it to try taming it, but it doesn't help. Normally, you'd keep it trimmed short, but you've been too lazy to lately, and it's definitely grown out more than usual.\n\nYou grab your regular brush from the small drawer beside your bed and give it a half-hearted run through your hair, managing to make it look marginally more presentable. You're about to leave it at that when your eyes catch something sitting on top of your drawer: a small floral-patterned brush.\n\nIt's definitely Lily's. She must've left it here by accident.\n\nYou pick it up, turning it in your hands. It's slimmer than your usual brush, and even the bristles are finer and more flexible. You glance back at the mirror, debating with yourself. Would it really hurt to run it through one more time? Just to make things look a little nicer?\n\n[Choice: Brush your hair again]\n[Choice: Leave it]",

The buzz of the Autumn Festival grows louder as you get closer—the faint whirl of rides spinning, the laughter of kids, and the hum of distant carnival music. It's familiar. Hell, almost comforting. But you can't shake the pit in your stomach.\n\n\"So let me get this straight,\" Luke says, brows furrowed as he looks over at you. \"You're saying that Madame Serena cursed you because you recorded her?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" you murmur, eyes fixed ahead. \"It's kinda fuzzy, but... she definitely got pissed when she saw my phone. Said something cryptic. Grabbed my wrist. Next thing I knew, I was out cold.\"\n\nLuke lets out a low whistle. \"That's wild.\"\n\nThen he glances at Samantha, brows raised. \"Wait—wasn't someone the one who dared [name] to record it in the first place?\"\n\n\"Oh, here we go,\" Samantha groans, throwing her hands up with a grin. \"Everything's always my fault, huh?\"\n\nLuke laughs. \"I mean, it kinda is.\"\n\nSamantha rolls her eyes but her smile doesn't fade. \"Okay, fine. Guilty as charged. I did tell you to record her, sure, but I didn't think it'd end in a cursed transformation arc! I just thought it'd be funny. Like, 'Haha, spooky tent lady caught on camera,' not... whatever this is.\"\n\nYou shrug, hands stuffed in your pockets. \"It's not your fault, really. I went along with it. I should've known better.\"\n\nYou pause, letting out a breath.\n\n\"But if she did curse me just for that, she seriously needs to chill out. I mean, who hexes someone over a phone?\"\n\nBy the time you reach the ticket booth at the entrance, the festival is already back in full swing. There's a steady stream of people moving in and out: kids with cotton candy, couples holding hands, booths shouting out about discounts. It's just like yesterday... only now, everything feels heavier.\n\nYou and your friends dig around and manage to pull out the tickets from the day before, hoping you won't have to pay again.\n\n\"Hey,\" Luke says, handing his to the man at the age—a tall guy with arms like tree trunks and a red staff shirt that looks about a size too small. \"Do these still work?\"\n\nThe man glances at the tickets, then shakes his head.\n\n\"Sorry, these are from yesterday,\" he says flatly. \"You'll need to buy new ones.\"\n\nSamantha leans on the booth counter, giving her best smile. \"Seriously? It's just one day. Our friend passed out in your creepy tent attraction yesterday. You'd think we'd at least get a pass.\"\n\n\"Rules are rules,\" he says, unmoved. \"One ticket, one day.\"\n\nYou sigh, pulling out your phone and watching your remaining cash dwindle even further. Twenty more bucks for another colorful scrap of paper—this one printed with today's date: September 24, 2024.\n\nAll this just for a chance to chase down someone who might not even be there.\n\nYou glance at the ticket in your hand. One number higher, one day later. It almost feels symbolic. Something has definitely changed.\n\nWith your new ticket punched and checked, the three of you step back into the festival grounds. It all looks the same as yesterday. But for you, everything's different now.\n\n[Choice: Go find Madame Serena]",

Laughter and chatter echo through the halls, but you duck out quickly—making a vague excuse to Luke and Samantha that you've got stuff to do tonight. Homework, family thing, whatever. It doesn't matter. You just needed to go alone.\n\nYou slip through the crowd and make your way down the sidewalk, retracing the familiar route to the Autumn Festival. Crisp leaves crunch under your shoes as you walk, the cool breeze biting at you. There's a tightness in your chest, and your fingers brush against the folded ticket in your pocket.\n\nThe ticket from yesterday.\n\nYou're not planning on riding anything or playing any games. You just need to find Madame Serena's tent. Talk to her. Demand some answers. Something. Anything to make sense of what's happening to you.\n\nThe festival comes into view just over the hill, its entrance marked by the same cheerful arch of pumpkins and string lights. The air is thick with the scent of fried food and cotton candy, and you can hear distant laughter and the shrill creak of the Ferris wheel slowly spinning.\n\nYou make your way up to the front gate, digging into your pocket and pulling out your crumpled ticket. The big guy working security is the same one from yesterday—broad shoulders, close buzzed hair, arms folded over his chest like he's guarding a secret vault.\n\nYou offer your ticket, hoping he won't look too closely.\n\nBut he does.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he says with the firm finality of someone who's repeated this line far too many times already. \"That ticket's from yesterday.\"\n\nYou blink. \"Wait, seriously? I just want to go back in real quick. I'm not even doing anything, I just need to talk to someone.\"\n\nHe shakes his head, arms still crossed. \"Doesn't matter. Rules are rules. You'll need to purchase a new one for today.\"\n\nYou let out a slow, frustrated sigh, trying to not let it show how much this annoys you. You weren't planning to spend more money—not when all you wanted to do was walk in, find that tent, and get out.\n\n\"Really,\" you mutter. \"It's just one day off. Everything's still the same.\"\n\nThe guy doesn't budge. \"Still gotta pay.\"\n\n[Choice: Try and run past him]\n[Choice: Try and persuade him]\n[Choice: Just pay for a new ticket]",

You'd swear the tent was near the edge, past the hay maze—but now, everything looks so festive and crowded that your memory may as well be lying to you.\n\nThen Samantha steps ahead of you and points. \"Right there, [name],\" she says dryly, flicking her wrist toward a shadowed corner near the back of the grounds.\n\nYour gaze follows her hand, and sure enough—the tent is still there.\n\nPurple and imposing, tucked behind a flickering lantern and a barely-used bench, Madame Serena's tent still stands. Same strange material, same gold embroidery curling across the entrance, and the same eerie stillness. It hasn't changed. Not one bit.\n\nYou exhale slowly, letting the tension drain from your shoulders. Part of you was convinced it'd be gone, like it had vanished the moment you blacked out. But no—it's real. Still here. Still waiting.\n\nLuke trots up beside you, squinting toward the tent like he's seeing it for the first time. \"Woah, there's no line. That's kind of sad. Poor lady's missing out on, like, huge psychic business.\"\n\nYou smirk. \"Well, if she's handing out curses just like that, maybe people are smart enough to avoid her.\"\n\nLuke laughs. \"Maybe she just has bad Yelp reviews.\"\n\nSamantha crosses her arms and tilts her head. \"Yeah, or maybe it's the fact that [name] walked in and collapsed like a cheap lawn chair.\"\n\nShe shoots you a glance, and while her tone is classic Samantha, there's a flicker of concern behind her eyes.\n\nThen, she adds, \"You sure you wanna do this? What if you pass out again? Or worse, what if she decides to finish the job?\"\n\n\"...Finish the job?\" you murmur, wondering what exactly she means.\n\nLuke puts a hand on your shoulder, his expression full of genuine encouragement. \"We can stay close if you want, [name],\" he says. \"If you want, we'll go in with you. If anything happens, I can carry you out like a hero.\"\n\nYou laugh under your breath, shaking your head. \"No need for that. I can go in alone. I've got it.\"\n\nSamantha raises an eyebrow, her tone teasing but less so than usual. \"Alright, brave soul. Just... don't come out of there with glowing eyes or levitating or anything. I'm not emotionally prepared for that.\"\n\nThen, her voice softens just a touch. \"Seriously, though. Be careful, okay?\"\n\nYou meet her eyes and nod, a quiet thank you passing between you without the need for words. Luke gives you a double thumbs-up, still beaming like this is the best adventure ever.\n\nYou turn back toward the tent. The entrance flutters slightly, like it's waiting. You close your eyes, steady your breath, and place a hand on the worn fabric.\n\nThen, with a firm tug, you pull it open—and step inside.\n\n[Choice: Talk to the seer]",

You squint past rows of vendors and pumpkins until finally, you spot it.\n\nTucked away in the far corner of the festival, partially shadowed by a line of tall corn stalks and backed up against a low hill, the purple tent still stands.\n\nYou exhale, tension easing from your shoulders. A part of you had fully expected it to be gone. No trace, like it had never existed. But no—there it is, same strange patterns stitched into the fabric, same slightly sagging frame, same ominous stillness.\n\nYou make your way toward it, weaving past people who barely glance in its direction. Just like yesterday, there's no line. No one even seems curious. It's as if the tent is invisible to everyone but you.\n\nWhen you reach the entrance, you pause for a moment, staring at the deep folds of the fabric that conceal what lies inside. You take a breath, close your eyes briefly, and press your hand against the cool, worn material.\n\nThen, with a quick yank, you pull the flap open and step into the darkness within.\n\n[Choice: Talk to the seer]",

Shadows stretch unnaturally across the fabric walls and wind chimes sing in the distance.\n\nAnd then... you see her.\n\nMadame Serena.\n\nShe reclines like a vision from another world, cloaked in purple silk and shadows. Gold chains adorn her arms and neck. Her veil is translucent, just enough to hint at the curve of her lips—painted dark and inviting—and the sharp glint of violet eyes lined in kohl.\n\nShe doesn't look up as she enters. She doesn't need to. The moment your foot brushes a woven rug lying at the entrance, she speaks—smooth and smoky, a voice like warm wine.\n\n\"I was wondering when you'd come back to me, little one.\"\n\nYou freeze. Her voice isn't loud, but it doesn't need to be. Every syllable lingers, slow and deliberate.\n\nShe raises her gaze to meet yours, and it's like looking directly into a fire.\n\n\"The mirror's begun to whisper, hasn't it?\" she murmurs. \"You've seen the edges of your truth, peeking out when no one else is watching. A shift in your gaze. A softness you never chose. You came back because now... you want to choose.\"\n\nYour mouth goes dry.\n\n\"I really didn't mean to record you,\" you say quickly, trying to summon sincerity even as your heart thunders in your chest. \"I'm sorry, I really am.

But low and musical, like a secret being exhaled.\n\n\"Oh, sweetheart... I didn't curse you.\" She leans in ever so slightly, her fingers tracing the edge of a tarot card without looking at it. \"I simply revealed you.\"\n\nYour blood runs cold and hot all at once.\n\n\"I didn't plant a single thing,\" she purrs. \"The mirror only reflects what was already buried. You think you're afraid of becoming someone else... but you're not. You're afraid of what you already are.\"\n\nYou take a shaky breath. \"Can you stop it?\"\n\n\"No,\" she says, not hesitating for even a second. \"But I can offer you something better.\"\n\nShe shifts, and the golden bracelets on her wrist whisper against each other. \"A deal. One I've only offered to the most interesting of souls.\"\n\nYou blink, swallowing. \"What kind of deal?\"\n\nHer eyes gleam like moonlight on still water.\n\n\"Each time the mirror stirs, each time your truth surfaces, I will give you a moment,\" she says. \"A breath. A choice. You will decide where the change touches next.\"\n\nYou pause, overwhelmed by the weight of her words.\n\n\"I guess I'll take it,\" you whisper. \"It's... better than nothing.\"\n\nMadame Serena smiles behind her veil—soft and satisfied. Like she knew you would.\n\n\"You already have.\"\n\nA shiver rolls down your spine. It's not painful. It's not even unpleasant. But it wants something. it waits for direction.\n\nYou clutch your arms, staggering toward a nearby mirror draped in purple silk.

She remains poised, regal as ever, a single brow lifting like a whisper of amusement.\n\n\"Control comes at a price,\" she says, her voice a low, velvet drawl.\n\nShe leans slightly closer, resting her chin against the back of her hand. Her other hand idly traces a shape on the tablecloth. \"[name], did you think mastering magic—your own truth—would come with step-by-step instructions?\"\n\nYou can't help but scowl. \"I mean... a heads-up would've been nice.\"\n\nSerena hums low in her throat, as if entertained by your frustration. \"And miss the look on your face?\" she murmurs, her eyes half-lidded. \"I couldn't, darling. Moments of clarity are always better when they arrive raw and unfiltered.\"\n\nYou grit your teeth, the sensation of the change still fresh on your skin. But now that you think about it, she's not exactly wrong. Now you know what the chill is, how it works, and what you're supposed to do with it. That alone is worth something.\n\nYou sigh and fold your arms. \"Well... at least I can choose what changes now, I guess.\"\n\nSerena gives you a pleased nod. \"Mhm. Power over the self. Most never ask for it. They just want to stay the same.\"\n\nYou glance down, still processing the change. The silence between you thickens, humming with unspoken thoughts. Finally, you lift your gaze and ask the question that's been gnawing at you.\n\n\"Is the curse... making me more feminine?\"\n\nThere's a long pause.\n\nSerena's smile curls, slow and knowing. She doesn't answer right away—of course she doesn't. She lets the question hang in the air, her eyes roaming your face with interest. She's reading not your expression, but your soul.\n\n\"I cannot confirm nor deny that,\" she says at last, her voice sultry. But the sparkle in her eyes and the way her lips barely suppress a smile when you say feminine... that's all the confirmation you really need.\n\nYou shift uncomfortably, her words hanging in the air. You want to press for more, to demand answers, but something about her presence makes you hesitate. It's not just her power—it's the way she already seems to know what you're going to say.\n\n\"Why me?\" you ask instead, quietly. \"Why... why this?\"\n\nShe tilts her head slightly.\n\n\"Because the mirror does not lie,\" she says. \"It only shows what has always waited beneath the surface. A whisper here, a moment there... and it begins to remember itself.\"\n\nYou stare at her, eyebrows furrowing. \"What exactly does that mean?\"\n\n\"You'll find that the mirror responds not only to what you do, but to what you allow,\" she continues almost lazily. \"A truth spoken softly. A gesture accepted without question. An instinct you no longer bury.\"\n\nEach time you let your guard down and leaned into something gentle, expressive, or vulnerable... the mirror responded.\n\nYou swallow hard. \"So it's not just about what I do—it's about who I am?\"\n\n\"Closer,\" Serena purrs, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction. \"But you're still clinging to the wrong question.\"\n\nYou hesitate.\n\n\"Then what's the right question?\"\n\nSerena leans back with an indulgent sigh, as if she's been waiting for you to ask that all along.\n\nShe lifts a finger, slowly drawing an invisible circle in the air between you. \"Let me help you, dear,\" she says, her voice now gentle but deliberate, like silk drawn across bare skin. \"Let's walk it back and start at the beginning.\"\n\nYou blink. \"The beginning?\"\n\nSerena nods. \"The very first shift. What was happening before the mirror stirred, [name]?\"\n\nYou frown, searching your memory. \"I passed out.\"\n\nShe tilts her head like a patient teacher. \"Yes. What was happening before the mirror stirred?\"\n\n\"You were doing the reading. The cards. You said something about my reflection. That I couldn't see it. That I feared it.\"\n\n\"And how did that make you feel?\" she asks.\n\nYou shift. \"Uncomfortable. Exposed, maybe. I thought you were full of crap at first, but then... I don't know. It was something about the way you said it—like you already knew me.\"\n\nShe gives a satisfied nod. \"Because I did.\"\n\nThe answer hits you a lot harder than you expect.\n\nShe lets the silence stretch a beat before speaking again. \"You didn't act feminine then. You didn't even try to. But at that moment, your mask slipped. Just enough.\"\n\nYou look up. \"My mask?\"\n\n\"The one you've worn all your life, [name]. The one shaped by fear, by expectations. By all the voices that told you who you had to be.\" She pauses. \"And when it slipped... the mirror stirred. It saw what you wouldn't say.\"\n\n\"So the first change happened because I was vulnerable?\" you ask, mouth going dry.\n\nHer lips curl slowly. \"Because you were honest.\"\n\nYou try and find your footing. \"So then what? every time I'm honest, I... change?\"\n\n\"Well, not just honesty,\" she purrs. \"Honesty in alignment with what lies beneath. You've already felt it, haven't you? The gentle things. The soft things. The parts of yourself you were taught to ignore. That's when the mirror listens.\"\n\nYou stare down at the table between you, voice barely audible. \"So, it's not just any action. It's when I do something... girly.\"\n\nHer eyes sparkle with delight.\n\nYou lift your head again. \"It's a feminizing curse.\"\n\nSerena breathes in deeply like she's savoring the moment, her eyes locked on yours. \"Yes, and now you know its shape.\"\n\nYou lean back, not sure what to say, what to think. The weight of it all presses into your chest.\n\nShe watches you with the air of a woman who already knows the next thing you're going to say.\n\nAnd maybe... she does.\n\n[Choice: Just leave]\n[Choice: Thank her and leave]\n[Choice: Insult her]",

You pause, your hand still curled around the edge of the tent.\n\n A part of you thinks about saying something. Maybe to thank her or insult her.\n\n But you don't.\n\n Because no matter how beautiful or composed or strangely magnetic she seems... she cursed you.\n\n She didn't ask. Didn't warn you. Just flipped your whole reality on its head and watched it unfold like it was entertainment. Sure, she gave you some kind of control after the fact—but that doesn't erase what she did.\n\n That doesn't make it okay.\n\n \n \n \n \n You pause at the entrance of the tent, one hand on the heavy fabric flap. You could just leave. Disappear. Pretend you never even came here.\n\n But something nags at you—something unresolved.\n\n You glance back.\n\n Madame Serena is exactly where you left her. She reclines with effortless grace, her fingers lazily tracing patterns along the table. The candlelight flickers softly over the curves of her body, catching on the smooth swell of her chest beneath the fabric of her gown. It hugs her in just the right places. Her cleavage rises and falls in a slow, deliberate rhythm, each breath measured and intentional. But it's her violet eyes that hold you still: sharp and locked on you. You can't tell what emotion lingers in them now. Curiosity? Expectation? Amusement?\n\n You clear your throat, shifting awkwardly. \"Hey,\" you begin, quieter now. \"Uh... before I go.\"\n\n Her eyes sharpen.\n\n \"I just wanted to say thanks,\" you say. \"For the control thing. I mean, you did curse me, so I'm not exactly thrilled about things. But still—having a say in how it changes me... that means something.\"\n\n For a moment, she doesn't respond.\n\n A flicker of something crosses her face—surprise, maybe. The tiniest parting of her lips, a blink that lasts just a little longer than usual. It's the kind of reaction she likely hasn't given anyone in years.\n\n And then, just like that, the mask returns. She straightens her shoulders and smiles.\n\n \"A rare thing,\" she says, her voice velvet-smooth. \"Gratitude, even when the gift is not what you expected.\"\n\n She tilts her head, eyes narrowing as she studies you again—almost like she's seeing something new, something she hadn't noticed before.\n\n \"You may yet surprise yourself, [name].\"\n\n \"Anyway,\" you mutter, turning back toward the exit. \"That's all.\"\n\n The flap parts in your hand, the cool air brushing against your skin again. You step out, but even as the festival noises return... you feel her eyes on your back.\n\n Watching.\n\n Measuring.\n\n Smiling.\n\n \n You take a step back from your table, the candlelight flickering in your peripheral vision as you try to collect yourself. Your heart still pounds, your mind racing from everything she just said.\n\n A feminizing curse. Triggered by softness. By expression. By you, simply letting down your guard.\n\n You don't know what burns more—your cheeks or your pride.\n\n You start for the exit, but frustration coils in your chest, hot and twisting.\n\n You stop.\n\n Turn halfway.\n\n Look over your shoulder at her—Madame Serena, still lounging like a queen in her shadow-drenched tent. Her lips are parted in a faint, smug smile.\n\n Waiting.\n\n Watching.\n\n She doesn't say a word—but you know she's expecting something. As if this whole conversation was just a setup to see how you'd react.\n\n And maybe that's what tips you over the edge.\n\n You exhale sharply, then scoff.\n\n You pause at the tent's edge, then glance back at her with a bitter smirk. \"You know, cursing me without warning for just recording you? Real classy.\" You lift your middle fingers. \"Thanks for that.\"\n\n There's a beat of silence before she laughs.\n\n Not a cruel laugh—no, not a cackle or a hiss. It's warm, rich, and indulgent. The kind of laugh you'd hear from a woman who already knows how the story ends. She leans back, her fingers brushing the veil from her cheek as her lips part into a slow, dazzling smile.\n\n \"Ah, the fire,\" she purrs, eyes glinting with wicked pleasure. \"You wear it well, darling. But do be careful...\"\n\n She traces one nail idly across the table, her tone still soft, sultry. \"Too much pride burns just as easily as shame. And pride, too, can make the mirror shimmer.\"\n\n You freeze, unsure whether that was a warning or a compliment—or maybe both.\n\n \"Come back when you're ready, little one,\" she adds smoothly. \"The mirror waits for no one... but it remembers everyone.\"\n\n You don't respond, but you don't need to.\n\n You push past the curtain flap and step out into the open air, letting the cool breeze hit your face. It's like waking up from a fever dream—but her scene still clings to you. Her voice still whispers at the edges of your mind.\n\n The feeling doesn't leave you. You just know she's smiling in the dark.\n \n\n \n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n [Choice: Continue]",

The wind carries the faint scent of kettle corn and pumpkin spice from behind you, but your thoughts are too tangled for you to really notice.\n\nYour shoes crunch softly on the gravel path as you spot your friends waiting for you just outside the tent—the two on a wooden bench. Samantha has her phone in hand while Luke swings his legs back and forth. He perks up immediately when he sees you, waving enthusiastically.\n\nYou take a deep breath, trying to steady your voice. \"Okay, well... I figured some things out,\" you say, your voice a little too casual for how fast your pulse is racing.\n\n \n Samantha straightens immediately. She takes one look at you and opens her mouth in shock. \"Oh my God, [name],\" she says, lifting a hand dramatically. \"What the hell is up with your hair? I know for a fact that hair isn't meant to grow that much in a few minutes.\"\n\n You grimace. \"Look, I'll explain, just—hang on. I know I'm screwed.\"\n\n You glance at the black hair cascading from your head, still not used to the way it sways when you move.\n\n \n \n\"I got cursed,\" you say finally, the words feeling ridiculous even as they leave your mouth. \"Like, actual magical shit. Madame Serena—the creepy fortune teller from the tent? Yeah, it was her.\"\n\nSamantha raises one eyebrow slowly.\n\n\"I got cursed to become more feminine... every time I do something girly.\"\n\nLuke blinks. \"Wait. What?\"\n\n\"Seriously?\" Samantha asks, tone dry as sandpaper. \"That's what's been going on? That's the curse? You wear lip balm and then you grow boobs?\"\n\nYou let out a long sigh before continuing. \"It's not exactly like that. It's more controlled. Madame Serena gave me some kind of choice. Like I get to pick which body part changes. She said I'm still going to change every time I do something feminine, though. It's not a fix.\"\n\nThere's a silence as your friends take a moment to think. Luke leans forward a little, peering at you. His eyes flick to your face, then down to your posture, like he's trying to match what he's hearing with what he's seeing.\n\nSamantha doesn't say anything at first. Her expression has shifted. Her usual sarcasm is gone now, replaced by something more thoughtful. Her eyes narrow slightly—not in judgment, but like she's weighing what you've said.\n\n\"Okay,\" she says after a beat, her voice quieter than before. \"You're serious about this.\"\n\nYou nod.\n\n<<if [feminineLooks] > 9>> \n Luke straightens up beside her, eyes wide. \"I mean... I see it. It's pretty obvious, your hair is way longer and kinda shiny.\"\n<<elseif [feminineLooks] > 5>> \n Luke straightens up beside her, nodding earnestly. \"Yeah! I mean... I didn't totally get it at first, but now that I'm looking, I kinda see it. You do seem a little softer.\"\n\n \n Luke straightens up beside her, pointing a little as he looks you over. \"I mean, to be honest, you look pretty much the same. Maybe a tiny bit different? If I didn't know you, I probably wouldn't even notice.\"\n \n\nA shaky breath escapes you as the weight of returning home like this starts to settle.\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

You wince and raise a hand to shield your eyes, blinking several times before your vision readjusts.\n\nThe air feels different out there—lighter and cooler. But the quiet that follows is heavy in its own way.\n\nYou glance around.\n\nThe festival is still alive with color and sound, but none of it touches you. Luke and Samantha aren't here with you. No familiar voices calling your name. Just the breeze in your ears and the weight of what just happened pressing against your chest.\n\nYou let out a long breath, thoughts swimming. Maybe you should've brought them with you—maybe you didn't want to face this alone. But it's too late now.\n\nYou mentally go over everything Serena said.\n\nThe curse.\n\nEvery time you do something girly—something soft, feminine, or expressive—the mirror stirs. Your body shifts. Slowly. Piece by piece. You will become more feminine. And unless you figure out how to stop it... or how to live with it... that's your future.\n\nAt least you have some control now. You can direct the changes. For now, though, that control seems limited—your face is the only part that seems to respond.\n\nYour stomach twists.\n\nSuddenly, it hits you: you're going to have to go home soon. You can't just walk through the front door looking totally different. Your mom, your sister—surely they'd notice.\n\nYou pull out your phone, holding it at just the right angle as you open the front-facing camera. The screen flickers to life.\n\nYou stare at yourself.\n\n<<if [feminineLooks] > 9>> \n Your breath catches.\n\n Your face is still your face. Same jaw, same cheekbones—but softer. Your eyes look wider, rounder, more open than they ever have. Not in shock, not in expression. Just... shaped differently. It makes you look almost delicate. Your lashes seem darker and longer too. It's as if you applied something—but you didn't.\n\n And your hair.\n\n It used to be short—messy and low-effort. Now, it brushes your neck. The strands look smoother and healthier. There's an unintentional shape to it now, the kind of soft framing most people spend time and money to style.\n\n It's you. Just different enough to make your stomach twist.\n\n This isn't a dream. Madame Serena wasn't just some weird lady in a tent. You actually changed. Not metaphorically. Not emotionally. Physically.\n\n You lock the screen and stare at your reflection in the black glass for just a moment longer.\n\n So this is what she meant.\n\n You shove the phone back in your pocket, pulse quickening. You've got to go home soon. And you need to figure out what the hell you're going to tell your mom if she notices.\n\n Which she absolutely will.\n<<elseif [feminineLooks] > 5>> \n There's a definite shift when you catch your reflection—one you can't just chalk up to lighting or tired eyes. Your face looks... different. Not so much that a stranger would call it out, but someone who saw you yesterday might hesitate. Maybe even stare, wondering what changed.\n\n Nothing's glaring—there's no makeup or dramatic effect—but something about you feels less boyish. You seem a little more refined and a touch more delicate. It's not quite feminine... not yet. But you're clearly on your way. You could probably come up with some kind of an excuse. Blame sleep, puberty, maybe even skincare.\n\n But deep down, you know. It's the curse, slowly working its way into your reflection.\n\n And if this is how much has changed already... you have to wonder how long it'll be before the rest of the world starts noticing too.\n\n \n You squint at the screen, tilting your phone this way and that to catch the light just right. For a moment, you wonder if you're just imagining things. Maybe it's the lighting. Maybe it's the fatigue in your eyes from everything that's happened.\n\n But still... there's something.\n\n It's subtle—so subtle it's almost not there. A softness at the edges, maybe. The barest hint of roundness where your features used to be sharper. Your eyes, while still familiar, seem to reflect light differently now. Brighter. Fuller.\n\n You frown, leaning in just a little. If you hadn't been watching so closely—if Madame Serena hadn't put the thought in your head—you wouldn't have noticed it at all. And even now, you're not sure if you're seeing it. That's how small the difference is. You could walk into your house, talk to your mom, your sister, your friends—and you doubt that any of them would bat an eye. There's nothing obvious. Nothing dramatic.\n\n But somehow, that still unnerves you. That it's all starting so quietly.\n\n You let out a slow breath and lower your phone, the screen going dark in your hand. If this is what the beginning looks like... what happens when it isn't subtle anymore?\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Her arms are still folded, but her posture has lost its usual edge. She exhales through her nose, then says dryly, \"Alright. So, hear me out... We tell your mom that you borrowed some of my miracle hair serum.\"\n\n You blink.\n\n \"What?\"\n\n She shrugs, giving you a weak, crooked smile. \"Yeah, like, I loaned you this crazy expensive product I ordered online and you didn't read the label. Boom-bap-bam—surprise Rapunzel moment.\"\n\n You stare at her.\n\n \"Look, I know it's not exactly airtight, [name],\" Samantha says, raising her hands. \"But your mom's not gonna think 'magic curse' unless you give her a reason to.

It's dumb but simple. And simple sells.\"\n\n There's a beat of quiet, then you glance at her, a small, grateful smile tugging at your lips.\n\n \"Thanks, Samantha. For not totally roasting me. And for, you know, actually helping.\"\n\n \"Don't get used to this,\" Samantha says. She rolls her eyes but doesn't, or maybe can't, hide the warmth in her voice. \"I'm still gonna make fun of you once this stops being a crisis.\"\n\n You let out a laugh. \"Fair.\"\n\n From beside you, Luke perks up. \"Wait, do you guys think the serum story would work for, like, sudden abs too? Just asking for a friend.\"\n\n Samantha sighs, lost for words.\n<<elseif [feminineLooks] > 5>> \n \"I mean... I should be able to come up with some kind of an excuse, right?\" you ask, your voice quieter than before. Your voice wavers at the edges as if you're trying to convince yourself more than anyone else.\n\n You glance down at your hands, fidgeting with your fingers.\n\n \"Like, c'mon,\" you mumble, swallowing hard. \"People don't really pay attention to this stuff... right?\"\n\n Samantha doesn't answer right away. She shifts her weight from one leg to the other before glancing over at you, eyes scanning your face. She shrugs.\n\n \"I mean, yeah,\" she says finally. \"It's not that noticeable. You don't look like a girl or anything like that. Yet.\"\n\n The \"yet\" isn't very reassuring.\n\n She pauses, then adds, \"I do think you'll be able to brush it off though. Just know you've got this, [name]. It's weird, yeah, but you're not alone.\"\n\n You nod, slowly, and try to hold onto that.\n\n Even if you're not sure you believe it yet.\n\n \n You let out a small breath of relief, a faint chuckle escaping as some of the tension drains from your shoulders.\n\n \"Okay, good,\" you say. \"That's... for the best. I can't go home looking too different. My mom would take one look at me and start asking a barrage of questions before I even take my shoes off.\"\n\n Luke grins and claps you gently on the back, maybe a little too hard. \"Hey, worst case scenario, just distract them with a snack.

Choosing your hair might have seemed like the best option at the time, for whatever reason, but now you're realizing the issue. Just how the hell are you going to explain how it suddenly grew several inches longer in a matter of hours?\n \n You notice that it's styled perfectly too. You tug at a strand, watching it slip through your fingers. It looks professionally done—like you spent the afternoon in a magical salon rather than cursed by a mystical seer.\n\n Your stomach twists nervously as you start mentally scrambling for explanations. Could you blame it on a prank? A bet? Maybe you could convince your mom and sister that you lost a weird dare with your friends. The problem is, you never cared much about your appearance before, so even that excuse might raise suspicion.\n<<elseif [feminineLooks] > 5>> \n You squint at your reflection, turning your head from side to side. Thankfully, the difference isn't glaringly obvious, but it is noticeable enough—especially to someone who sees you daily, like your mom and sister. There's a subtle softness and a slightly more delicate look to you. Whatever it is, it's just enough that you'll need an explanation.\n\n You sigh quietly, trying to think of something believable. Maybe you tried something new or borrowed a styling tool from Samantha. As a joke, of course. It won't be easy, but at least you have a fighting chance of convincing them nothing strange happened. Still, your heart beats a bit quicker as you anticipate the curious glances at home.\n\n \n You let out a relieved breath as you examine your reflection closely. There's barely any noticeable difference at all. You tilt your head as you check every angle, but thankfully, it seems negligible. If your family notices anything at all, which they probably won't, it should be easy enough to brush off.\n\n At least for now, the curse remains subtle enough to manage without raising suspicion.\n \n\nYou slip your phone into your pocket and begin the slow walk home.

No fainting spells today.\"\n\nYour mom chuckles softly. \"Well, that's very thoughtful of you both. Thank you for looking out for him.\"\n\n\"No problem,\" Samantha says with a wink. \"We're very responsible. Terribly mature.\"\n\nThey wave goodbye and slip out the door, and for a second, you're left in the quiet of the entryway. \"Mom, I'm heading to my room now, okay?\" you call out as you go toward the stairs.\n\n\"Alright, just be down when I call you,\" she replies. \"Your father's getting home soon—we're finally having a family dinner tonight.\"\n\n\"Will do, Mom,\" you reply.\n\n[Choice: Go to your room]",

She blinks rapidly, clearly trying to process what she's seeing.\n\n You swallow nervously, instinctively reaching up to touch your hair. You offer a forced smile before speaking, hoping your lie holds water. \"Oh, uh—they're extensions, you see. Hair extensions. I... wanted to try something different, see what longer hair would look like on me.\"\n\n Your mom stares for a second longer, clearly taken aback, then gradually relaxes. Her shoulders lower slightly, and a curious smile spreads across her face. \"Well, they look extremely convincing. I wouldn't have guessed extensions.\" She tilts her head, studying more closely. \"And honestly? You pull it off. Longer hair suits you.\"\n \n Relief washes through you, and you let out a quiet, albeit nervous, chuckle. \"Thanks, Mom.\"\n<<elseif [feminineLooks] > 5>> \n As soon as she spots you, she pauses mid-step.

Wanted to look a bit nicer.\"\n\n \"Well, whatever you're doing, keep it up,\" your mother says, nodding approvingly. \"It's subtle, but it suits you.\"\n\n \"Thanks, Mom,\" you reply quietly, glad that she accepted your half-truth without suspicion.\n\n \n She walks casually into the living room, glancing at you without noticing anything unusual. She takes a long sip of water before placing the glass down on the coffee table. \"So, how was your day, [name]?\"\n\n You breathe a sigh of relief, grateful that she hasn't noticed anything different about you.\n\n \"I'm fine,\" you respond simply.\n \n\nAfter a pause, you stretch slightly. \"Anyway, I'm gonna head up to my room, okay?\"\n\n\"Sure thing, sweetheart,\" your mom says, giving you a cheerful nod. \"Just make sure to come down when I call you.

With the chaos of the day finally quieting down, you're reminded that school still expects you to do your work. Homework waits for nothing, not even curses.\n\nYou turn on your computer and skim through the assignments you received today. As you begin to work, you quickly find yourself immersed. \n \n<<if [study] > 84>> \n To your relief, the homework feels surprisingly easy. You breeze through the problems and readings, quickly settling into a steady pace. Each assignment is clear and each question is familiar. It doesn't take long before you've completed everything there is to do without even breaking a sweat. After the whirlwind of a day you've had, it's a quiet comfort that at least your homework is easy.\n<<elseif [study] > 79>> \n Fortunately, as you get into your assignments, you realize that it's not all too challenging. Sure, there are moments when you pause and times when you have to double-check. But for the most part, you navigate through it without too much strain. Your homework isn't easy, but it is manageable.\n\n \n Unfortunately, it doesn't take long at all before you realize something: you're struggling. The physics problems feel trickier than they should be, and the English reading feels dense and monotonous. Every question is a struggle, each page harder than the last. You fight through it anyway, determined not to fall behind on your first day, but it's frustrating.\n \n\nThe instant you click the button to submit your last assignment, the muffled rumbling of the garage door opening reaches your ears. A few seconds after that, you can catch your dad's voice downstairs, mingling warmly with your mom's cheerful greetings.\n\n\"[name], Lily—time for dinner!\" your mom's voice rings clearly up the stairs.\n\nYou stretch your arms over your head and stand up. The thought of facing your entire family still sends a brief flutter of nervousness through your stomach, but you push it aside. You've managed everything so far; surely dinner of all things won't be too difficult.\n\nAfter taking a deep, deep breath to steady yourself, you leave your room and head downstairs toward the warmth of your family.\n\n[Choice: Go to the Yoon family dinner]",

Your father stands near the counter, still in his dark business suit—sharp and professional, sure, but clearly exhausted. His tie is loosened slightly, his briefcase set aside, and dark circles beneath his eyes hint at long flights and meetings that seems to go on for hours.\n\nHe glances over to your mother briefly, murmuring something quietly that earns a soft laugh from her. He then turns his attention toward you. His face breaks into a warm, albeit weary, smile. It's genuine, yet tinged with the distance you've unfortunately grown accustomed to from his constant absences.\n\nYour dad's work keeps him out of town more often than not. He's spent more time juggling hotel stays and airports than sitting down for family dinners, and though you've grown used to it, his presence tonight feels oddly reassuring.\n\n<<if [feminineLooks] > 9>> \n He pauses immediately, his expression shifting to one of amused surprise as he takes in your noticeably different appearance. \"Son, what happened to your hair?\" he asks, chuckling. He runs a hand through his own neatly trimmed hair as if checking to compare. \"Have I really been gone that long? It's only been three weeks—your hair sure grows fast, huh?\"\n\n \n You swallow the lump of anxiety in your throat, quickly summoning the same flimsy explanation Samantha had offered your mom earlier. \"Oh, yeah—they're, uh, because of this weird hair serum. I borrowed it from my friend, Samantha. You remember her, right?\"\n\n Your dad's tired eyes assess you, and for a second, you worry that he'll realize something's wrong. But he then shrugs good-naturedly, accepting it without question. \"Well, things like that happen, I suppose,\" he says with a slightly awkward smile.

He pats you on the shoulder, a rare gesture you can't help but appreciate.\n\n \"I'm doing fine, Dad,\" you respond genuinely. \"Glad you're finally back.\"\n\n \"Trust me when I say me too, [name],\" your dad replies, his sincerity evident in the tone of his voice. \"Hotels get pretty old after a while.\"\n \n\nThe comfortable moment between you is abruptly interrupted by your mom's exasperated voice from the hallway, sharp and tinged with frustration.\n\n\"Lily, come out right this instant!\" your mom calls, stomping over toward Lily's room, clearly at her wit's end. \"Honestly, that girl just refuses to listen! Lily, your father's home, and dinner is ready!\"\n\nA muffled groan emerges from Lily's room. You hear the sound of footsteps dragging across the wood floor before the door lazily opens. Lily's there, her trademark wolfcut looking disheveled. A scowl is etched deeply into her features as your mom practically guides her by the arm toward the dining table.\n\n\"Geez, Mom, I heard you the first million times!\" Lily protests, pulling her arm free and slumping into her chair with an exaggerated sigh. \"You don't have to drag me around like a toddler.\"\n\nYou can't help but laugh quietly at the scene unfolding in front of your very eyes.\n\nThat was a mistake.\n\nLily instantly snaps her neck toward you, eyes narrowed in fiery irritation.\n\n<<if [feminineLooks] > 9>> \n \"And you, [name]—stop laughing!\" she says, her eyes narrowing as she scrutinizes your appearance. \"What happened to your hair?

It's smoother, shinier, and falls more gracefully against your face than it ever has before. The strands frame your cheeks neatly, softening your features in a way that's almost delicate.\n\n You reach up and run your fingers through it.\n\n It feels like silk.\n\n This isn't just tidying up bedhead. It isn't just a better brush. This is something else altogether.\n\n You glance toward the mirror again, and this time, you truly study yourself. There's a different quality to your appearance now. You look more polished, more refined. Your hair even gleams slightly in the light coming through the window, no longer unruly or flat. Hell, it even makes your round eyes stand out more.\n\n A chill runs down your spine.\n\n Your mind flashes back to the night before.\n\n \"The mirror will reveal your truth, piece by piece, until you learn.\"\n\n You take a shaky breath.\n\n Could this really be it? You barely even did anything. Just brushed your hair. Sure, you used your sister's brush because it was closer, and—what, that was enough?\n\n You want to dismiss it, to laugh it off. But your heart's racing, and there's a tightness in your chest that refuses to ease. You know your hair wasn't like this before.\n\n Is this what she meant? Was Madame Serena being serious?\n\n You swallow hard and try to focus. There's no time to spiral, not now. You glance at the clock and realize you've already wasted a few minutes staring at yourself. You don't have any answers to the questions swirling in your mind, not yet, and school's still happening regardless of whether your reflection is shifting or not.\n\n You gather your things, methodically packing your backpack. Laptop, charger, notebooks, pencils. You force yourself through the rest of your routine. Washing your face, brushing your teeth, and throwing on clean clothes.\n\n Your sister storms past your door as you step into the hallway, head down and thumbs flying over her phone screen. Her wolfcut is a total mess. It's like she'd rolled out of bed and didn't bother fixing it.\n\n You give her a light elbow nudge as you pass.\n\n She glances up with a raised brow and half-smirk. \"Watch it, loser.\"\n\n But then her expression shifts just a little. She gives you a second look, brow furrowing.\n\n \"...Did you do something to your hair?\" she asks, clearly curious. \n \n Your stomach drops.\n \n Then, without waiting for an answer, she shrugs and keeps walking. \"Looks kinda different.\"\n\n You exhale and try to shake the moment from your mind. It's fine, [name]. She probably didn't mean anything by it. Still, her comment loops in your head as you move through the rest of your morning.\n\n As you head toward the door, your mom steps out from the kitchen holding a mug of coffee.\n\n \"Bye, Mom,\" you call, pulling on your shoes near the entryway.\n\n \"Hold on,\" she says, setting the mug down and walking over. \"Let me get a good look at you.\"\n\n You don't have any time to react before she pulls you into a warm hug. You tense up a little—less from the hug itself and more from the thought she might notice something.\n\n She pulls back and studies you for a second, her brows knitting together.\n\n \"Did you do something with your look?\" she asks, tilting her head. \"You look a little... prettier today.\"\n\n Your heart skips a beat.\n\n You let out an awkward, unconvincing laugh. \"No, nope, not at all. It's still the same old me.\"\n\n \"Huh.\" She doesn't sound convinced, but she lets it go. \"Well, have a good day at school, alright?\"\n\n \"Got it, bye!\" you say quickly, swinging open the front door.\n\n You step outside into the crisp morning air. The door clicks shut behind you.\n\n And for a moment, you just stand there on the front step, backpack slung over your shoulder and heart thudding against your ribs.\n\n Prettier.\n\n You take a deep breath.\n\n Something is definitely happening, and you're starting to think Madame Serena wasn't bluffing.\n\n \n You glance at your reflection in the mirror.\n\n Your hair's still sticking up at odd angles. But instead of fixing it, you just stare at it for a second and sigh, setting the brush down.\n\n It's fine.\n\n Not great. Not even good, if you're being honest. But good enough.\n\n You do decide to give your hair a quick finger comb, trying to pat it down in a few places, but that's about all the effort you're willing to give. Brushing it properly would take time and patience, neither of which you have this morning.\n\n Besides, school starts in less than thirty minutes. You haven't done anything to prepare, and your appearance is the least of your worries right now.\n\n You turn away from the mirror, grab your backpack, and start going through the usual checklist. Laptop, charger, notebooks, pencils. You double-check just to make sure.\n\n Everything's accounted for.\n\n You head to the bathroom to knock out the rest of your routine. You splash some cold water on your face and brush your teeth, moving quickly but not carelessly. The whole thing only takes a few minutes, your thoughts drifting aimlessly from topic to topic the whole time—Madame Serena, the missing video, the weird empty tent.\n\n What did it all mean?\n\n You still don't know.\n\n Your sister passes by the bathroom door as you step out, wolfcut a total mess—like she slept face-down on a pillow and never bothered to fix it. You nudge her lightly with your elbow as you walk up.\n\n She glances up from her phone. \"Watch it, loser.\"\n\n You chuckle under your breath, shaking your head. That's more like it.\n\n You return to your room and slide your backpack onto one shoulder. Your stomach grumbles, but you just ignore it—skipping breakfast has been a regular thing for you since middle school. You'll just wait until lunch, as always.\n\n By the time you reach the front door, your mom's already in the kitchen, sipping coffee and scrolling through something on her tablet. You call out to her over your shoulder.\n\n \"Bye, Mom!\"\n\n She steps out into the hallway. \"Hold on—let me get a good look at you.\"\n\n Before you can duck out, she pulls you into a hug. It's warm and familiar and a little too tight, like she's trying to squeeze all the growing-up out of you before it's too late.\n\n \"Geez, Mom, I'm eighteen,\" you mumble with a laugh. \"I'm an adult, y'know.\"\n\n \"Well, a mother can hug her son whenever she feels like it,\" she says, squeezing one last time before letting go. \"Now go. Try not to fall asleep in class.\"\n\n Your sister leans against the wall, arms crossed, smirking. \"Bye, ugly,\" she says, sticking her tongue out before ducking back into her room.\n\n You roll your eyes, grab the handle, and pull the door open.\n\n The morning air is cool and crisp as you step outside, your shoes stepping against the concrete path. The door clicks shut behind you, muting the sounds of your family as the outside world comes into focus.\n\n Everything feels normal.\n\n Almost too normal.\n \n\n[Choice: Walk to school]",

      "text": "You walk to school at a sluggish pace, hands in your pockets and eyes on the sidewalk. Each step feels heavier than the last, not from exhaustion, but from the weight of your thoughts. The morning air is crisp, the kind that should feel refreshing—but you barely even register it.\n\nYou're far too deep in your own head.\n\n \n Even your mom and Lily had noticed something. They didn't say it like it was a big deal, but they both said you looked different. That wasn't something you heard every day. You hadn't done anything major—just brushed your hair. But the way it looked afterward and the way it felt—it was different. Too different to be normal.\n\n You keep thinking about Madame Serena's voice, smooth and cryptic: \"Each time you act on what you cannot see, the mirror will shift.\"\n\n \n Your eyes are what get you the most. The shape is just wrong. They're rounder and softer—not enough for anyone to call you out on it yet, but you see it. You can't not see it. And it's all you can think about.\n\n You wonder, if you'd picked up the brush, would something else have changed too? Was that part of what Madame Serena mentioned? Or are you just imagining things—spiraling because you got scared?\n \n\nYou're so caught up in your own thoughts that you don't even notice someone jogging up behind you until—\n\n\"[name]!\"\n\nYou jolt slightly as Luke practically bounds up to your side, flashing that big grin of his. His backpack bounces behind him with each step, and his sneakers slap against the sidewalk with the energy of someone who absolutely doesn't get quiet mornings.\n\n\"There you are! Man, I've been trying to catch up for a while now.\" He falls into step beside you, walking a little too close like he doesn't believe in personal space. \"How are you?\"\n\nYou blink at him, your brain still booting up from the sudden shift in energy.\n\n\"Oh. Uh. Hey,\" you say awkwardly. \"I'm... good.\"\n\nLuke stops walking for half a second, tilts his head, then catches up again, spinning around to face you as he walks backward. \"Good?\" he echoes with a playful frown. \"That's it? Just 'good'?\"\n\nHe circles back around and drapes one arm across your shoulder like it's the most natural thing in the world. \"[name], dude, you passed the hell out yesterday. You scared me and Samantha. We messaged you all night, you know. You didn't reply, though. I thought you were dead or grounded or abducted by aliens or something.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" you mumble. \"I just... needed to clear my head.\"\n\nLuke pulls back a little but still walks close beside you. He eyes you for a moment, lips pursed.\n\n\"What?\" you ask, catching the look. \"Do I have something on my face or something?\"\n\nLuke tilts his head, squinting a little more.\n\n\"Well, you do seem different today.\"\n\nYou freeze mid-step. \"Wait—really?\"\n\nYou stop walking, turning toward him. \"Do I look... different?\"\n\nLuke blinks. \"Uh... I mean...\" He leans in without hesitation, his face suddenly way too close. You instinctively pull your head back, brows furrowed as he scans your face.\n\n\"Hmm...\" He circles around you. \"Let's see here. Same nose. Same dorky posture. Same death glare when you're annoyed.\"\n\nThen he steps back, breaking into a wide grin. \"Nope! You're still the same old [name]. Gotta say I am the better-looking friend, though.\"\n\nYou groan and rub your face. \"Luke.\"\n\n\"What?!\" he says with a loud laugh, giving your shoulder a playful bump. \"You asked! I gave you my professional Luke opinion. Others have to pay for that, y'know.\"\n\n\"But seriously,\" he adds, voice softening a little, \"why'd you ask? Is something wrong?\"\n\nYou hesitate, unsure of how much you can say—unsure of whether you even should.\n\nMadame Serena's words echo again in the back of your mind:\n\n\"To see yourself fully, you must first experience the other side of that reflection.\"\n\nAnd now Luke, your best friend, is standing here, eyes full of warmth and genuine concern, waiting for an answer.\n\n[Choice: Tell him about your suspicions]\n[Choice: Just brush it off]",

The moment stretches awkwardly, your mouth slightly open like your brain's buffering. You look down at your shoes, then back up at Luke, who's blinking at you expectantly with that easy grin that hasn't quite registered the shift in your tone.\n\nYou hesitate.\n\nSaying it out loud will make it real. You've been turning the thought over and over in your mind since last night, trying to convince yourself it's just paranoia. Just stress. Just something—anything—you could explain away rationally.\n\nBut you can't.\n\nAnd bottling it up is starting to feel like it might crush you.\n\nSo, you take a slow, steadying breath, trying to organize the storm of thoughts in your head into something that sounds even halfway sane.\n\n\"I think I've been... changing.\" You look Luke in the eye now, even as your gut twists. \"Physically. I mean—like, actually changing.\"\n\nLuke's smile falters.\n\n\"And I think... I think it's because of that lady. The one at the Autumn Festival. The fortune teller—Madame Serena. Fuck, I think she cursed me.\"\n\nThe moment the word cursed slips past your lips, you already regret it. It sounds ridiculous. You sound ridiculous.\n\nLuke, to his credit, doesn't immediately burst out laughing. But he does stop walking.\n\nHe blinks a few times, mouth twitching slightly like he's not sure whether he misheard you or if you're setting him up for a joke. \"Wait.. what?\" he says. \"Back up—did you just say cursed?\"\n\nYou nod slowly, your expression dead serious.\n\nHis grin fades. He squints at you, brows drawing together as his tone shifts. \"Come on, [name]. Stop trolling. You can't be serious right now.\"\n\n\"I know how it sounds,\" you say quietly.\n\nLuke stares at you like you've just grown a second head. \"Dude, are you okay? Like—actually okay?\" His voice is more careful now, more measured. \"Because... you did pass out yesterday. Maybe we should've taken you to the nurse or even the hospital or something. I thought you just fainted from heat or stress, but...\"\n\nHe trails off, watching you closely.\n\nYou let out a slow, frustrated sigh. You knew this was going to be his reaction. Hell, it's the only logical reaction. And if the roles were reversed, you know you wouldn't believe it either.\n\n\"I swear I'm not crazy, Luke.\"\n\nYou rub your hands down your face, trying to get the words out without sounding like a total lunatic. \"I've just... noticed things. Weird things. My reflection looks off. I don't know what's happening.\"\n\nYou look over at him again, unsure if you're hoping he believes you or hoping he'll tell you you're just being paranoid.\n\n \n You take another breath and point to your head. \"Okay, just—look at my hair.\"\n\n Luke blinks. \"Your hair?\" He gives you a weird look, his tone light but confused. \"Uh... yeah? It looks good! Kinda fluffy today.\"\n\n You sigh. \"It's not just that I brushed it. Luke, it's... different. Like, actually different.\"\n\n He lets out a short laugh, trying to break the awkward tension. \"Dude, I'm pretty sure brushing your hair doesn't mean you're haunted or whatever.\"\n\n You groan. \"No, seriously. Just—here.\" You lean your head forward slightly. \"Touch it.\"\n\n Luke recoils slightly. \"Wait. What?\"\n\n \"Touch my hair,\" you repeat firmly. You're not even sure why you care this much, but something about it is real—you can feel it, and you need someone else to feel it too.\n\n Luke stares at you for a moment, visibly uncertain. \"Bro, are you asking me to pet you?\"\n\n \"Just shut up and do it!\"\n\n He laughs again, hands raised in surrender. \"Alright, alright, I will. You're weird today.\"\n\n He reaches out hesitantly and runs his fingers through your hair. At first, it's just a casual pass, but then he slows down. His expression shifts—eyebrows lifting and mouth parting slightly.\n\n \"Dude... what the hell is this?\" he murmurs. He strokes your hair again, more deliberately this time. \"Why is it so soft? It's like... a shampoo commercial or something. What did you do?\"\n\n You give him a look. \"Nothing, I just brushed it.\"\n\n Luke's eyes widen. \"That's it? Bro, no shot. That's not normal from brushing. You sure you didn't bathe in unicorn tears or something?\"\n\n You hesitate. \"...I used my sister's brush.\"\n\n \"Ohh,\" Luke gasps dramatically, like you just revealed a forbidden secret. \"That's kinda scandalous. I hope you didn't steal it. Lily doesn't deserve that.\"\n\n \"No, it's not like that. When I used her brush, it felt... weird. Like the texture of my hair started changing while I was brushing. Not just smoothing it out like normal, but like it was actually transforming.\"\n\n Luke steps back, looking at you with an odd mix of confusion and curiosity.. \"That's actually kind of creepy. Like, your hair legit feels like it belongs to someone else. Someone with, like, fancy haircare routines and ancient Japanese serums.\"\n\n You don't laugh.\n\n He notices. \"Wait... are you saying that's what's changing? That the curse is turning your hair soft?\"\n \n \"It's not just my hair,\" you say. \"It's my eyes too. But with my hair, it looked normal yesterday. You saw! But this morning? It falls differently. It reflects light differently. It even moves differently. I noticed it right away, and so did my mom and Lily. They both said I looked... prettier.\"\n \n Luke stares at you, blinking slowly.\n\n \"Okay,\" he finally says, drawing the word out like he's still processing. \"So, to summarize: you think a psychic at the carnival cursed you, and now you're... evolving into a better shampoo model.\"\n\n You roll your eyes. \"I'm serious, Luke.\"\n\n \"I know, I know,\" he says quickly, holding up his hands. \"I am taking you seriously. It's just... wow, man. That's a lot.\"\n\n You nod. \"Yeah. Tell me about it.\"\n\n \n You gesture toward your face, stepping closer so Luke can get a clear view. \"Here, look carefully at my eyes.\"\n\n Luke pauses, confusion spreading across his face as he tries to follow you. \"Your eyes?\" He tilts his head, his brows knitting together for a moment before breaking into a teasing grin. \"Uh, okay. Are we about to share a romantic moment here?\"\n\n You groan, waving his comment off impatiently. \"Come on, Luke, be serious for once. Don't they look different? Like, at all?\"\n\n He chuckles but quickly composes himself when he realizes you're genuinely anxious. \"Alright, alright, serious time.\" He clears his throat dramatically and leans forward, squinting theatrically as if he's inspecting fine art. \"Hmm, let's see here. Yep, brown eyes. Two of them. it all checks out.\"\n\n You sigh deeply, irritation slowly bubbling. \"Luke, come on! They're... bigger, right? Rounder, softer? Something's definitely different—are you really telling me you can't see that?\"\n \n His goofy grin slowly slips as he sees how worried you are. He tilts his head again, this time sincerely focusing. \"Actually, now that you say it,\" he begins, all humor momentarily put aside. Genuine surprise flickers across his expression as he examines your face. \"They're definitely different. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, but they're just a bit larger. Now I can't unsee it.\"\n\n \"I knew it,\" you mumble, your shoulders slumping. \"I swear they weren't like this before I went in that tent. I thought I was going crazy.\"\n\n Luke gently pats your shoulder, immediately slipping back into his usual, comforting energy. \"Hey, if you're going crazy, you're taking me with you. I'd never leave you behind! We can have matching padded rooms.\"\n\n Despite your nerves, you can't help but chuckle. Luke always had a knack for breaking the tension, no matter how serious the situation.\n\n \"But seriously, how exactly does someone's eyes just get rounder overnight?\" Luke asks, eyebrows raised curiously now. \"You think it's really something supernatural?\"\n\n \"I don't know,\" you say honestly. \"Maybe it's just stress getting to me. But ever since I passed out after meeting Madame Serena, weird stuff has been happening.\"\n\n Luke runs his hand through his hair thoughtfully, puffing out a dramatic sigh. \"Man, why couldn't she have cursed me instead? I've always wanted big anime protagonist eyes,\" he teases, nudging you playfully. \"You're hogging all the cool curses.\"\n\n \"You're ridiculous,\" you state, laughing despite yourself.\n\n \"I'm being serious!\" Luke insists, his bright smile returning. \"If you ever want to hand it over to me, all I'm saying is I'm here.\"\n\n You shake your head, your mood finally lifting slightly thanks to his ridiculous attempts at comfort \"Thanks, Luke.\"\n\n \"Always,\" he responds, wrapping an arm around your shoulders. \"Even if you suddenly sprouted cat ears and a tail, I'd be right here, man. Probably holding a laser pointer, but still right here.\"\n\n \"Okay, enough,\" you say, pushing him off playfully.\n \n\nThe two of you fall silent as you near the school gates. The building rises ahead, students already wrapped up in the ordinary chaos of yet another day.\n\nBut for you, it all feels oddly distant, like you don't quite fit in anymore.\n\nLuke walks beside you at a slower pace than usual, like he's deliberately keeping things easy. You can tell he's still mulling over what you told him—processing it in that Luke way, where his brain might be confused but his heart's in the right place.\n\nFinally, he exhales, glancing toward the entrance. \"Well... here we are,\" he says, giving you a little smile. \"Home sweet stress factory, as they say in Rome.\"\n\nYou let out a little huff of a laugh.\n\n\"Let's get through this day and then talk more about what's going on, alright?\" Luke affirms. \"Don't worry, [name]. Even if you turn into a frog or start glowing or whatever, I'm still gonna hype you up.\"\n\nDespite everything you're going through, you can't help but smile.\n\nThat's your best friend for you.\n\nAs weird as things have gotten, you're glad you're not going through it alone.\n\n[Choice: Go to school]",

A giant poster of Shakespeare stares down at you from one wall, his balding head and ruffled collar judging everyone in the room. There's a bulletin board in the back covered with laminated papers about \"The Elements of Plot\" and \"How to Write a Strong Thesis Statement.\" You'd honestly be shocked if she wasn't an English teacher.\n\nA few students are already there, scattered across desks, scrolling on their phones, earbuds in, mentally in another universe. The clock reads 7:58 AM, and there's still no sign of Ms. Carter.\n\nYou glance around the room, trying to figure out where to sit. You recognize most of the faces—names you know, people you've passed in hallways or shared awkward group projects with—but that's about it. Aside from Samantha and Luke, your two best friends, your circle's always been pretty small. By choice, of course.\n\nStill, one person immediately catches your eye—Jessica Sanders.\n\nEven sitting alone, she somehow manages to dominate the room. Her long blonde hair is tied up in a perfectly styled high ponytail, a maroon bow perched neatly on top like a crown. A few strands of hair frame her face just right, like they've been placed there on purpose. She's wearing a pink cardigan over a white tee that boldly reads \"A little bit dramatic,\" paired with a high-waisted denim skirt and cherry-shaped earrings that swing slightly every time she moves.\n\nShe doesn't seem bothered by the fact that she's alone—if anything, she looks like she chose to be. One leg crossed over the other, her phone held in one hand, she scrolls with quiet confidence. Hell, even her posture is perfect, like she's aware of the invisible spotlight always on her.\n\nNo entourage. No nervous glances. Just Jessica. Effortlessly beautiful. Effortlessly cool.\n\nYou quickly look away, not wanting to have anyone think you're staring. There's no universe where you're brave—or delusional—enough to sit next to her.\n\nYou find an empty seat closer to the back and slide into it, grateful no one's nearby. You pull off your backpack and set it on the floor just as the door opens. A woman briskly walks in, setting a reusable water bottle down on the desk at the front.\n\nShe looks to be in her mid-forties, dressed in a cardigan and flats, with the exact kind of energy you'd expect from someone who has already had two coffees this morning.\n\n\"Good morning, everyone,\" she says with a bright, practiced smile. \"Sorry for the last-minute entrance—I had some teacher stuff to handle.\"\n\nThe students barely acknowledge her presence. A few lift their heads while others just continue to scroll. Ms. Carter claps her hands lightly, motioning for everyone to put their phones away.\n\n\"There's not much we're doing in homeroom today,\" she continues. \"Which I know you're all thrilled about. But I am going to ask each of you to come up and talk to me for a few minutes—just a quick check-in so I can put faces to names and get to know you a little.\"\n\nShe takes a long sip from her bottle, then adds with a grin, \"The rest of the time is all yours. Chat, scroll, nap—with limits, please. But otherwise, enjoy.\"\n\nThere's a collective wave of nods and quiet relief. Some teachers would've filled the hour with busy work or forced icebreaker activities. A few minutes of talking in exchange for almost an hour of free time? Not bad.\n\nYou glance at your backpack, wondering what to do with yourself. You could scroll your phone like everyone else or actually try and get some work done.\n\nIt's up to you.\n\n[Choice: Study]\n[Choice: Browse your socials]",

Reading has always been something you've enjoyed, even if you don't talk about it much.\n\n Her eyes light up. \"Oh, I love that,\" she says, clearly pleased. \"You'd be surprised just how rare it is for students to say that unprompted.\"\n\n You offer her a small smile. \"Yeah, I know it's not the most exciting thing in the world, but... I don't know, it helps me get out of my head sometimes.\"\n\n \"Well said,\" she nods, folding her hands together. \"So, what's your favorite book or series?\"\n\n You think for a moment before deciding.\n\n \"I've always been into A Song of Ice and Fire.\"\n\n Ms. Carter lets out a nostalgic sigh. \"Such a brilliant series. It's dense, complex, full of flawed characters and moral gray areas... I have to say I loved the political scheming more than the dragons, though.\"\n\n \"Same,\" you say, chuckling. \"Though I kinda doubt it'll ever be finished.\"\n\n She laughs with you, though there is a trace of sadness in it. \"Yeah, I've made my peace with it years ago. Still, it's something special. If you like stories like that, I can recommend a few books you might love.\"\n\n \"Yeah?\" you ask, eyebrows lifting. \"I'd appreciate that.\"\n\n She smiles. \"I'll write some down for you later.\"\n\n \n \n \"I do play basketball sometimes,\" you say with a small shrug. \"It's all just for fun, though. Nothing serious.\"\n\n Ms. Carter tilts her head slightly, interested. \"Oh? That's great. Though... it is a shame that our school doesn't have a team.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, nodding. \"Kinda feels like football gets all the love at Pacific Crest.\"\n\n \"That's usually how it goes,\" she agrees with a sympathetic smile. \"It's unfortunate, really. Basketball is a beautiful sport. Fast-paced, tactical. Very poetic in its own way.\"\n\n You blink. \"Poetic?\"\n\n \"What?\" she asks, grinning. \"I'm an English teacher—I see poetry in everything.\"\n\n You chuckle. \"Fair enough. Even if we did have a team, I doubt I'd make it. I'm not exactly NBA material.\"\n\n \"Well, you never know what you're capable of unless you try,\" she says, her voice soft but encouraging. \"Some of the best players didn't start out strong—they just refused to give up.\"\n\n You nod slowly. Maybe Ms. Carter is right. Maybe it doesn't have to be about being great, but rather about doing it because you love it.\n\n \n \n \"I guess... I spend a lot of time with friends,\" you say, feeling slightly unsure. \"Talking, hanging out. Just... being around people, I guess.\"\n\n Ms. Carter smiles knowingly. \"That absolutely counts. We're social creatures, after all. Connecting with people is one of the healthiest things you can do for your mind.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I guess it helps me feel normal,\" you say slowly. \"Especially lately.\"\n\n She chuckles softly. \"Same here. You'd be surprised how much time teachers spend chatting in the break room just to decompress. Teaching really can be isolating if you let it be.\"\n\n \"That makes sense.\"\n\n \"I still talk to my high school friends, actually,\" she adds. \"Not all of them, of course. But the good ones... they really stick. Make sure you hold onto yours.\"\n\n You think of Luke and Samantha before nodding. \"Yeah. I will.\"\n\n \n \n \"Well... I kind of just browse social media a lot, to be honest,\" you admit, feeling immediately self-conscious. \"Nothing special. Instagram, TikTok, stuff like that.\"\n\n To your surprise, Ms. Carter doesn't laugh or look disappointed. Instead, she nods like she gets it.\n\n \"You're not alone,\" she says, smiling. \"Social media can be a great way to stay connected and feel like part of a community—even if you're just lurking.\"\n\n You chuckle, easing up a little. \"Yeah, I'll open one app to check something and then realize an hour went by and I watched, like, a hundred videos I don't even remember.\"\n\n \"That sounds exactly like me,\" she says, laughing. \"Honestly, half the time I get on to answer one message, and suddenly I'm watching a dog rescue reel and crying.\"\n\n The tension slips away as you both laugh. Maybe your answer wasn't as lame as you thought.\n \n\n\"Well, back to the topic, I just wanted to take a little time to get to know each of my homeroom students,\" Ms. Carter says warmly. \"We'll be seeing a lot of each other this year, and I think it makes things nicer when we're not total strangers.\"\n\nYou shift slightly, giving her a modest shrug. \"I mean... I'm not really that interesting though.\"\n\nThe words come out casually, but you realize you mean them. You've always thought of yourself as the definition of average. Nothing special. You weren't the star athlete, or the genius, or the class clown. If someone tried to write a book about your life, it'd probably end up gathering dust on the shelf.\n\nShe gives you a look—gentle, but firm. \"[name], that's nonsense. Everyone's interesting in their own way. Sometimes it just takes the right person asking the right questions.\"\n\nYou glance up at her, surprised by how sincere she sounds. She doesn't say it like a teacher trying to be encouraging. She says it like someone who genuinely believes it.\n\nBefore you even know it, the conversation flows easier. She asks about your classes, your interests, and what you're hoping to do after high school. You're a little awkward at first, but Ms. Carter is surprisingly easy to talk to—calm, attentive, and sharp enough to pick up on your nerves without pointing them out.\n\nTime passes quicker than you expected.\n\nEventually, she glances at the clock and begins to wrap things up. \"Alright, I'll let you get back to what you were doing.\"\n\n \n Then she pauses, her eyes catching on your hair. \"You have really lovely hair, [name],\" she says with a warm smile. \"Very smooth.\"\n\n You blink, caught off guard by the compliment. \"Oh, uh... thanks.\"\n\n It takes a second before the full weight of it hits you. That's exactly what's been bothering you lately—your hair. The very thing you've been obsessing over.\n\n \n Then she pauses, her eyes catching on your hair. \"You have really nice eyes, [name],\" she says with a warm smile. \"Very expressive.\"\n\n You blink, caught off guard by the compliment. \"Oh, uh... thanks.\"\n\n It takes a second before the full weight of it hits you. That's exactly what's been bothering you lately—your eyes. The very thing you've been obsessing over.\n \n\nYou smile politely and stand to return to your seat, but your mind's already racing.\n\nCoincidence? Maybe. But it feels like another small nudge. Another clue that something really is changing.\n\n[Choice: Continue with school]",

The scent of questionable cafeteria food lingers in the air—some kind of greasy pizza today, by the smell of it. You grab a tray from the lunch line and wait until you get your own slice of Pacific Crest's microwaved pizza. You spot Luke and Samantha already seated at your usual table, eating their meals and deep in conversation.\n\n\"Hey guys,\" you say, weaving through a few crowded tables before setting your tray down and dropping into the seat next to Luke.\n\nLuke gives you a quick nod between bites. \"Yo.\"\n\nSamantha looks up a second later. \"Hey, [name].\"\n\nThen she pauses.\n\nHer eyes narrow just slightly—not in a mean way, but in that hyper-observant, scanning kind of way. Her lips press together like she's trying to figure something out. A beat of silence passes, just long enough to make you glance up.\n\n\"What?\" you ask, blinking. \"Did I get pizza sauce on my face?\"\n\n\"No...\" she says slowly, tilting her head a little. \"You just look a little different today.\"\n\nYou freeze for a second. \"Different how, exactly?\"\n\nShe shrugs, but her eyes are still locked on you, studying your face like a puzzle she's halfway through solving. \"I don't know. It's subtle. Your... I don't know, something's softer.\"\n\nLuke finally looks up from his fries, squinting at you with mild curiosity. \"Really? I don't see it.\"\n\n \n Did he forget already?\n\n \n \n\"Of course you don't,\" Samantha mutters with a sigh. \"Boys, I swear.\"\n\n \n Her eyes flick up to your hair. \"Okay, wait, I got it—your hair. That's part of it. Did you style it this morning or something? It looks very clean. And your eyes too! They're... brighter? Rounder?\"\n\n She leans in dramatically, squinting at you. \"Did you secretly get plastic surgery overnight and just not tell us? This is very suspicious behavior, [name].\"\n\n \n She squints more deliberately. \"No, seriously—your eyes. They're bigger, rounder than usual. I've known your face for years, [name]. Don't play coy with me. Did you get surgery? Contacts? Anime eye drops?\"\n\n She says it playfully, but her brow is furrowed. She's definitely not imagining it.\n \n\n \n Luke speaks up before you can even open your mouth. \"Well, [name] thinks the lady in the tent cursed him! He told me about it this morning.\"\n\n You shoot him a look. \"Dude—maybe lead into that a little slower?\"\n\n \"What the hell, a curse?\" she asks, skeptical but clearly interested. \"Seriously?\"\n\n \n Samantha blinks, then narrows her eyes. \"Okay, but cursed how? Because if you're about to say she cursed you to look better, I'm gonna need a minute to roll my eyes.\"\n\n You sigh, brushing your fingers through your hair. \"Look—I brushed my hair this morning, and it literally changed. Like something weird happened. Now it's silkier and smoother. My eyes changed yesterday too. You noticed it yourself.\"\n\n Samantha crosses her arms. \"So let me get this straight—you're cursed, and the curse is turning you into... a version where you actually use conditioner?\"\n\n \"I'm serious.\"\n\n Luke leans in, his eyes wide, clearly invested. \"No, but like—it could be real. What if it's some magical makeover thing?\"\n\n Samantha smirks. \"So what, next week he sprouts wings and starts glowing?\"\n\n \"I mean, if that happens, I'm calling dibs on being his sidekick,\" Luke says, grinning. \"But seriously, [name], if you're freaked out—we've got your back.\"\n \n \n You exhale and point to your face. \"Just—look at my eyes. They're bigger, rounder. Something changed after I passed out. Madame Serena said a bunch of cryptic shit too. It wasn't just fortune teller nonsense, trust me. It felt... weird.\"\n\n Samantha squints, resting her chin in her hand. \"Right. So instead of giving you a cheesy future prediction, she gave you anime eyes. Totally normal.\"\n\n \"I'm not saying I have all the answers,\" you mutter, \"but I know something changed. And nothing can really explain it.\"\n\n Luke's brows draw together, his voice softer now. \"Hey, it is weird. If you're worried, we'll help figure it out. I mean, maybe it's not a curse or anything, but still—you shouldn't go through it alone.\"\n\n He claps a hand on your shoulder with a grin. \"Plus, I like adventure stuff.\"\n\n \"You like cartoons about talking dogs solving mysteries,\" Samantha says dryly.\n\n \"Exactly!\" Luke beams.\n \n\n \"Okay, so, we check out the Autumn Festival after school?\"\n\n Samantha rolls her eyes, but there's a flicker of a smile underneath. \"Fine. But if we end up summoning a ghost, you're on your own.\"\n\n \"You know what, that's a deal,\" you reply, chuckling.\n\n And just like that, your little trio falls back into the rhythm of teasing and inside jokes. But even as you join in, part of your mind stays focused on one thing.\n\n You're going to find Madame Serena. Whatever's happening—this is just the beginning.\n\n [Choice: Investigate with your friends after school]\n\n \n Luke tilts his head, looking at you more closely now. \"Wait... is that why you asked me about your face this morning?\" he asks, eyes narrowing in curiosity. \"You were acting kinda weird.\"\n\n Your mind scrambles for something—anything—to cover your tracks.\n\n \"Uhh...\" You scratch the back of your neck, trying to play it cool. \"Nah, it's nothing like that. I've just been, y'know, trying to take better care of myself lately. Little self-improvement arc for me.\"\n\n Samantha raises an eyebrow. \"Wow. [name] Yoon, finally discovering skin care and brushing his hair. Stop the presses.\"\n\n \"It's not like you take care of your appearance much either,\" you shoot back. \"I don't see you with makeup on.\"\n\n Samantha gasps theatrically. \"Excuse you—I don't need makeup to look good. I'm just lazy, okay? It's called natural charm.\"\n\n Luke laughs, completely delighted by the back-and-forth. \"You guys are my favorite sitcom, you know that?\" he says.\n\n Despite the jokes flying, you're grateful the topic of your appearance is shifting. The change in your eyes, the gut feeling that something's off—it's still there, heavy in the back of your mind. But for now, you're not ready to say it out loud.\n\n You laugh along with them, falling into the rhythm of casual banter. Samantha is back to teasing Luke for not knowing how to fold a hoodie properly, and Luke's trying to convince you both that ketchup belongs on eggs.\n\n Still, under the surface, your thoughts are racing. The moment the final bell rings, you'll be on your way back to the Autumn Festival. Alone.\n\n You need answers.\n\n [Choice: Investigate by yourself after school]",

The ticket guy barely gives you a glance as he shifts his attention to the next group of people.\n\n And then—you bolt.\n\n You spring past the booth like it's a finish line, your feet hitting the pavement fast and light. The guy calls out behind you, but by the time he registers what just happened, you're already weaving through the crowd.\n\n You duck behind a cotton candy stand, then slip between two photo booths. A quick glance over your shoulder tells you he's still looking around, but not moving anymore. After a minute or so, he throws up his hands and turns back to his post.\n\n You smirk to yourself, heart pounding with adrenaline and satisfaction. Guess those years of running drills in gym paid off after all.\n \n \n \n You sigh loudly, making it look like you're giving up—then suddenly make a break for it.\n\n Or... try to.\n\n You only make it a few steps before a massive arm extends across your chest and stops you like a steel bar. The guy barely moves, just lets out a short laugh as he grabs you by the shoulder.\n\n \"Nice try, kid,\" he says with a grin. \"But you're gonna need a lot more cardio before you pull that off.\"\n\n You flush red, your pride bruised more than your body. You nod sheepishly and shuffle back to the booth. So much for being slick.\n\n There, you fork over another twenty bucks with a groan. The vendor hands you a new slip of paper—this one marked with the date: September 24, 2024.\n\n All that, just to replace a piece of paper with another. Your bank account is emptier and your ego's dented, but at least you're in.\n \n\n \n <<if [social] > 59>> \n You don't panic—you pivot.\n\n \"Okay, listen,\" you start, voice low and serious. \"I passed out here yesterday. And I think I dropped my necklace somewhere—silver, with a little lion pendant? My grandpa gave it to me before he passed. It's the last thing I really have to remember him by.\"\n\n A total lie. You don't even own a necklace, let alone a grandpa who's handing out sentimental heirlooms. But your voice sounds real and your expression is convincing. You even throw in a little desperation, just for good measure.\n\n The man frowns, his crossed arms loosening slightly.\n\n \"Oh... that was you? Yeah, I heard someone fainted near the tent. You okay?\"\n\n \"Yeah, mostly. I'm just worried I lost it somewhere near one of the booths.\"\n\n He hesitates before nodding. \"Alright then, go on ahead. Just try to be quick, alright?\"\n\n You nod, trying not to let your grin show until your back is fully to him.\n\n You walk past the gates like you've done nothing wrong. Smooth.\n \n \n \n You fumble through the words, trying to throw something together on the spot.\n\n \"Uh, hey. I, uh, passed out here yesterday and... like, I left... something? Maybe? Can I just... get in?\"\n\n The guy doesn't even blink. \"Yeah, nice try,\" he says flatly, gesturing to the ticket line. \"Come back when you've got twenty bucks like everyone else.\"\n\n You curse your terrible improvisational skills under your breath and retreat. Another twenty gone. Another paper slip—September 24, 2024. Great.\n\n You pocket the ticket and walk in with your head down, trying to pretend you haven't just publicly embarrassed yourself.\n \n\n \n \n You don't try to bluff or sneak in. There's no point, after all. You just sigh and resign yourself to the inevitable.\n\n You get another ticket after twenty dollars leaves your bank account.\n\n September 24, 2024.\n\n Same festival.

By the time you make it to the dining room, the scent of warm eggs and toast lingers faintly in the air.\n\nYour mom is seated at the table, sipping something, probably coffee, from a mug. Across the room, Lily is rinsing her plate in the sink, clearly just finishing up breakfast.\n\nShe's wearing one of her many oversized hoodies and pajama pants, her wolfcut surprisingly not a mess for once. It actually looks really clean...\n\nYou grin mischievously.\n\nJust as she turns to leave the kitchen, you grab her in a quick headlock and noogie her with expert older-sibling precision. Not hard enough to hurt, you'd never do that, but enough to ruffle her hair into total disarray.\n\n\"Hey! My hair!\" Lily shrieks like you just committed a federal offense. She wiggles free and sprints to the hallway mirror, staring at her reflection in abject horror. \"[name]!

Your voice bounces off the brick walls of the locker room, and both guys pause mid-laugh. You square your shoulders a little, trying to sound more confident than you feel. \"Seriously. Don't talk about her like that.\"\n\nThe tall one turns, eyebrows raised in shock. \"Oh? What, are you her bodyguard now?\" he says, a slimy grin spreading across his face. \"Gonna duel me in the name of love?\"\n\n\"No,\" you snap. \"I'm not a creep. Maybe try not being the loudest asshole in the room for once.\"\n\nThat shuts them up.\n\nFor a second, it looks like they're going to say something else—maybe throw a cheap insult your way—but instead, they exchange a glance, snort, and wander off toward the other end of the locker room.

You definitely wouldn't have won any fight.\n\nYou exhale and pull your shirt over your head—when a soft voice speaks up beside you.\n\n\"That was... really well said.\"\n\n \n \n \n \n\nYou glance to your side and spot him—shorter than you, maybe 5'7\", with messy hair and a pair of oversized glasses perched on his nose. His backpack's a little too full, and you can see he's hugging a beat-up copy of Guns, Germs, and Steel like it's a security blanket.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever seen anyone shut those guys up like that,\" he adds, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. \"Especially not without throwing a punch or causing a scene.\"\n\nYou blink, still catching up. \"Uh. Thanks, I guess.\"\n\nHe offers you a small nod. \"Vincent. Some people call me Vinny. You don't have to—I don't really mind either way. Just figured I should say something since, you know, it's rare to see someone take the high ground. Or any ground, really.\"\n\n\"Hey, Vincent,\" you say, the name sounding more familiar now. You've definitely seen him around—sitting near the front in history, always scribbling in the margins of his notes, occasionally raising his hand to drop an oddly specific fact no one else knew.\n\n\"I've wanted to say something to those guys before,\" he says, adjusting the strap on his backpack. \"But I kind of... seize up when stuff actually happens.

You saying anything—even just calling it out—breaks the illusion. It throws them off. Like pulling the curtain back on a really bad magician.\"\n\nYou glance at him. He doesn't say it like he's trying to impress you. It seems like he just... thinks like that.\n\nSmart and thoughtful.

As soon as the last straggler enters, she lets it rip.\n\n\"Alright, listen up!\" she calls out, commanding the room with that no-nonsense tone she's famous for. \"Today, we're playing pickleball. If you don't know what that is, you'll figure it out. Find a partner—quickly—or I'll assign one for you.\"\n\nThe gym erupts into movement as everyone scrambles to pair off. People click into their usual friend groups without hesitation, and within seconds the room has changed. Everyone is in little pods of two, laughing or stretching.\n\nEveryone except you.\n\nYou stand there awkwardly, glancing from face to face. You don't know many people in this class, not enough to partner up without it feeling forced. You look around, half-hoping someone will make eye contact and invite you—but no one does.\n\nJust as you start to wonder if Coach Blake is going to throw you in with one of the overly competitive football guys, you feel a light tap on your shoulder.\n\nYou turn and find Vincent standing there, already holding a paddle in one hand.\n\n\"Hey,\" he says. \"Wanna team up?\"\n\nHis tone is casual, like it's no big deal, but the way he fiddles with the strap of his watch with his free hand says otherwise. His glasses are slightly fogged from the humidity and his hair's just as messy as it was earlier.\n\n\"I don't exactly have a long list of gym partners,\" he adds with a sheepish smile. \"Figured I'd shoot my shot before Coach sticks me with one of the guys who thinks this is the Olympic trials.\"\n\nYou let out a breath you didn't realize you were holding. \"Yeah, sure. I'd like that.\"\n\n\"Cool,\" Vincent says, smile growing just a bit. \"Thanks—for not leaving me to the wolves.\"\n\nAs you both head over to one of the empty courts, you glance over. \"So... are you any good at this?\"\n\nVincent snorts softly. \"I once pulled a muscle trying to catch a frisbee, so that should give you a baseline.\"\n\n\"Sounds promising,\" you respond.\n\n\"Hey, I'm not totally hopeless,\" he says, acting offended. \"I've got solid hand-eye coordination. I just... prefer it when the stakes are academic. Or fictional.\"\n\n\"So, what you're saying is that you're a danger in a debate, but a liability on the court.\"\n\n\"You get it!\" he says. \"Let's just aim for not-last.\"\n\nThe two of you claim an empty section of the court, each of you gripping your paddle with the hesitancy of someone holding an alien object.\n\n\"So... how hard do you think this is supposed to be?\" you ask.\n\nVincent shrugs. \"It's basically tiny tennis, right? How bad can it possibly be?\"\n\nAnswer: pretty bad.\n\nThe first few attempts are an absolute mess—missed swings, awkward footwork, a few balls that bounce nowhere near the net. But after a few minutes, you both manage a rally or two.\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" Vincent says between breaths. \"I think I've achieved... basic competence.\"\n\n\"You mean you stopped swinging like you're swatting a bug?\"\n\n\"I prefer to think of it as chaotic neutral athleticism,\" he grins.\n\nYou're both laughing when Coach You return to the main group just as Coach Blake steps into the center of the gym, blowing on her whistle again to get everyone's attention.\n\n\"Alright, now that you've all had a few minutes to stop embarrassing yourselves, it's time to play for real,\" she says. \"We're doing two-on-two. I'll call the pairs. Try not to injure each other.\"\n\nYou and Vincent have barely gotten used to how the paddles feel in your hands, so the idea of a full game is... less than ideal.\n\n\"Great,\" Vincent mutters beside you. \"I've just now figured out how to hit the ball without it ricocheting around the gym. We're totally qualified for this.\"\n\n\"Just aim for not embarrassing ourselves,\" you reply.\n\n\"I already lowered the bar to not requiring medical attention,\" he states.\n\nCoach Blake starts rattling off names. As soon as you hear who you're playing against, your stomach sinks.\n\nOf course. Of course.\n\nYou and Vincent are up against the same two guys from the locker room. The universe really has a sense of humor, huh?\n\n\"Hey,\" says the shorter one, lips curled into a smirk. \"Figures we'd end up against you.\"\n\nHis eyes flick to Vincent. \"Didn't know it was bring-your-lab-partner-to-gym day.\"\n\nThe two of them snicker like they've just dropped the funniest line of the century.\n\nVincent doesn't flinch. \"I guess we've resorted to playground insults.\"\n\nYou don't bother saying anything. You're already gripping the paddle tighter than necessary.\n\nThe game starts, and it's clear from the first rally that neither team is going down easily. The tall guy has a reach that makes every lob feel like a gamble, and his friend actually knows how to play—not well, of course, but enough to be a problem. You and Vincent fumble through a few points but start getting into a rhythm, finding little windows to return the ball cleanly.\n\nIt's tense, but you end up pleasantly surprised when the score creeps up evenly. Point for point. You might actually have a shot at this.\n\nMatch point.\n\nVincent's breathing hard, brow furrowed in focus. \"Okay, one more,\" he mumbles. \"One more and we get to not lose.\"\n\nThe ball soars toward you—low, fast, and a little off-center. You don't have time to think. It's now or never.\n\n<<if [athleticism] > 59>> \n [Choice: Hit it confidently, you can do this!]\n\n \n [Choice: Just do your best]",

Too wide.\n\n The ball sails out of bounds, skimming the line by a few inches before landing on the floor with a dull thwack.\n\n Game over.\n\n \"Let's go!\" one of the guys hoots. \"Told you we'd crush you.\"\n\n You're still frozen in place, heart racing, your breath coming out in short, frustrated bursts. That was it. Match point. Gone.\n\n Vincent jogs over, shaking his head with a grin. \"Okay. I know we lost. But c'mon, that wasn't half bad.\"\n\n \"'Not half bad' still means we lost,\" you mutter, staring at the spot where the ball landed.\n\n \"Sure, but we held our own,\" he replies, adjusting his glasses. \"Against those two? That's basically a moral victory.\"\n\n One of the guys walks past and throws in a parting shot: \"Better luck next time.\"\n\n You ignore him. Barely.\n\n Vincent raises an eyebrow. \"Didn't know losing to two guys who peak in high school was this character-building.\"\n\n \"Guess we'll get 'em next time,\" you say, cracking a tired smile.\n\n \"Or we could avoid all future gym classes,\" Vincent ponders. \"Join a chess club. Fake an injury. The options are endless.\"\n\n Despite the loss, you can't help but laugh—you're still glad you didn't back down.\n \n \n \n You lunge for it—your paddle poised as your feet slide on the court.\n\n The ball comes at you fast, way faster than you're ready for. But somehow, your instincts kick in. You twist your wrist, angle the paddle, and make contact.\n\n Whap.\n\n The ball cuts through the air—low, sharp, and right past the tall guy's outstretched arm. It bounces once on their side and then again before either of them can move.\n\n Point.\n\n Game.\n\n You blink, stunned for a second.\n\n Vincent stares for a few moments. Then his eyes go wide behind his crooked glasses. \"Wait. Did we just win?\"\n\n \"We won,\" you say, still catching your breath.\n\n Vincent lets out an incredulous laugh and throws his arms up. \"Let's go! That was clutch!\"\n\n The two guys on the other side just stand there, completely dumbfounded. The tall one scowls, while his buddy mutters something under his breath.\n\n \"You've got to be kidding me,\" the tall one groans. \"You beat us with Vincent?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" Vincent says brightly, adjusting his glasses. \"Weird, huh? Almost like you shouldn't underestimate people.\"\n\n They grumble and slink off while you and Vincent celebrate.\n\n \"Okay,\" Vincent says, his voice breathless but proud. \"I'm gonna be riding that high for like... the rest of the semester.\"\n\n You laugh, still in disbelief. \"That was pure luck.\"\n\n Vincent shrugs. \"Sometimes, luck's all you need.\"\n\n You can't help but grin. A win is a win, and it feels pretty damn good.\n \n\n \n The ball rockets toward you—a fast, low shot that would've thrown off just about anyone else.\n\n But not you.\n\n You pivot, knees bent, paddle gripped tight. In one fluid motion, you step forward and meet the ball with a precise backhand. It flies right past the tall guy's reach, skimming the corner of the court before bouncing out of bounds.\n\n Match point. Game over.\n\n The court falls silent for a second—then Vincent lets out a wild, breathless cheer beside you.\n\n \"Holy crap, that was beautiful!\" he laughs, pushing his glasses up. \"That return was textbook. Like, if there was a textbook for that—I'd highlight the hell out of it.\"\n\n You grin, your breath still steady despite the game. \"Guess exercise paid off.\"\n\n The two guys on the opposing team are not nearly as pleased.\n\n \"You've got to be kidding me,\" the tall one mutters, raking a hand through his sweat-damp hair. \"You two?\"\n\n \"You lost to a nerd and a guy with great reflexes,\" Vincent says matter-of-factly, still panting. \"Sucks, doesn't it?\"\n\n The tall guy scowls and turns away, grumbling under his breath about something. His friend follows, throwing a glare over his shoulder as they stomp off to sulk somewhere else.\n\n Vincent turns to you, eyes shining. \"You know, I thought I was going to have a heart attack throughout that second half, but that was awesome.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"it was.\"\n\n You can't help but grin. A win is a win, and it feels pretty damn good.\n \n\n[Choice: Finish up school]",

There's nothing else on your schedule for once—no festival or mysterious seer—just the freedom of your own bed and maybe some mindless scrolling.\n\nAs you approach your front door, you spot Lily rounding the corner from the opposite direction. Your schools are on totally different ends of the city, a cruel design choice clearly made by someone who hated families.\n\n\"Hey, twerp,\" you say casually, not even turning your head as you fish out your keys.\n\nShe doesn't miss a beat. \"Don't even start.\"\n\n\"Didn't start. Just making a simple observation,\" you reply.\n\nShe rolls her eyes and walks a little faster to cut ahead of you. \"Move. You take forever to unlock the door.\"\n\nYou nudge her with your elbow. She elbows you back, harder. That turns into light shoves as the both of you try to get to the door first.\n\nBy the time you both step into the house—shoes kicked off and backpacks dropped—you're still bickering.\n\nThen you both stop short at the sight of someone unexpected in the living room.\n\nYour dad.\n\nHe's still dressed in his usual business attire, but his tie is loosened and his laptop is closed for once. He's sitting on the couch, actually sitting, like a normal person. Not pacing on a phone call or glued to his emails. Just... present.\n\n\"Dad?\" you say slowly, like you're unsure whether he's a hologram. \"You're not at work?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lily chimes in with the same tone of disbelief, tilting her head. \"Aren't you supposed to be, like, in Shanghai or something?\"\n\nYour dad chuckles, running a tired hand through his hair. \"Not today, apparently.\" He leans back against the couch with a sigh, one that sounds like it's been building up for a while. \"I've been thinking lately—about how much time I've missed. With both of you.\"\n\nYou exchange a glance with Lily.\n\n\"I've been working too much,\" he continues. \"I know that. I thought if I just earned a little more, climbed a little higher, it would all be worth it. But now your senior year's here, and it hit me: I've been blinking through your childhood.\"\n\nThere's a weight to his words. He's always been distant, always buried under a never-ending barrage of conferences and projects. You're not used to this version of him—the one who sounds like he regretted things.\n\n\"So,\" he says, sitting up straighter. \"I've talked to my boss. I'm pulling back this year. Fewer hours. No more business trips. I want to be here before college comes and the house gets quiet.\"\n\nLily flops onto the armrest next to him, eyes wide. \"So what, you're going to, like, make us breakfast now or something?\"\n\n\"Don't push your luck,\" he says, smirking. \"But I was thinking... maybe we celebrate. Go out for ice cream? just the three of us.\"\n\nYou blink, taken aback. You can't remember the last time the three of you did something like that together—maybe when you were eleven? It's been years since he's even suggested something that didn't involve a calendar invite.\n\n\"I mean, I was gonna hop on Roblox,\" Lily mutters, clearly tempted. \"But I guess I can get a scoop.\"\n\nYou laugh, shaking your head. \"Yeah. I'll come too.\"\n\nThis seems to be your dad's version of saying sorry. Of trying to start over.\n\nAnd honestly? That's worth a cone.\n\n[Choice: Go get ice cream]",

The place has a very retro vibe—checkered floor tiles, pastel walls, and a glowing menu board buzzing faintly.\n\nLily doesn't waste a second. She practically sprints to the display case, her sneakers squeaking against the floor. \"Ooh, they've got new flavors!\" she says, smushing her hands and nose against the glass like she's five again. \"Wait—there's mango sorbet now?!\"\n\nYou walk up beside her and lean casually on the edge of the display. \"Maybe try something new today.\"\n\n\"I am.

You gonna get a Capri-Sun with that too?\"\n\n \"Lily, it's literally one of the most popular flavors in the world,\" you say, raising an eyebrow.\n\n \"Popular doesn't mean good,\" she fires back. \"Minion memes are real popular.

That thing looks like it's legally classified as a health hazard.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow, smirking. \"Sounds perfect for someone with your taste in Roblox outfits.\"\n\n \"You take that back!\" Lily complains.\n\n \"Only if you admit cookies and cream is the superior flavor,\" you respond, shrugging.\n\n She squints at you, then looks at the ice cream. \"...Fine. It's decent. But cherry's still better.\"\n\n \"Keep telling yourself that,\" you mutter.\n\n \n \"I'll get the medium-sized strawberry, please,\" you say, pointing at the pink, creamy swirl in the display case.\n\n Lily squints at you, then smirks. \"Geez, are you a girl now or something?

When she rings everything up, the price makes your eyebrows raise a little. Ice cream really has become overpriced.\n\nYour dad doesn't flinch at the total, just pulls out his wallet and pays, flashing a small smile as if making a point that he's trying.\n\nYou all head toward a quiet booth tucked into the back corner of the parlor. It's a little cramped, with you and Lily shoulder-to-shoulder on one side and your dad across from you. The moment you sit down, Lily starts squirming.\n\n\"Move your fat elbows!\" she hisses, trying to shove you with one of her scrawny arms. You, of course, take this as an invitation to spread out even more.\n\n\"Oh, sorry, am I invading your personal throne?\" you ask, nudging her further. \"Didn't realize we had assigned seating.\"\n\n\"Ugh, you're the worst. Ever heard of personal space, genius?\"\n\n\"I read about it in one of my many high school textbooks,\" you reply smugly, letting the \"middle schooler\" part go unspoken.\n\nAcross the table, your dad watches the exchange with a tired sigh. He sets his pistachio down carefully, like he needs a second before jumping in.\n\n\"I see your dynamic hasn't changed a bit,\" he says, giving a weak smile. \"You two know it's just family at the end of the day, right? Maybe try not to act like sworn enemies.\"\n\nLily scoffs, arms crossing. \"Well, if it's just family, then how come you're never here?\"\n\nHer voice is sharp. Not loud or dramatic—just cutting. And you glance over at your dad in time to see the way his eyes go a little distant.\n\nThere it was. The thing none of you like to say out loud.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Lily,\" he says after a pause. His voice is low, and there's no defensiveness in it—just guilt. \"I've been gone too much. I let work take over everything. I thought making money and providing stability was enough. But I should've been here more. With both of you. I'm... trying to do better now.\"\n\nLily's eyes flicker down to her ice cream, and she shrugs, still stiff. \"I guess it's fine. I mean... you're here this year, right?\" She doesn't look at him when she says it, but there's a tiny crack in her armor.\n\nYour dad nods gently. \"I'm here. No more trips. No more missing everything.\"\n\nThen he looks at you.\n\n\"And you, [name]? I owe you the same apology. I've missed a lot these past few years. I wasn't around, and I know that. But I want to be here for you now—especially this year. Whatever you need, I'll be here. But only if you'll let me.\"\n\nHe holds your gaze as he waits.

I think I would've traded some of that stability for a little more time with you. Just having you around would've been nice.\"\n\n Your dad's expression falters.

I don't expect forgiveness for missing most of your life. I can't undo that. But I can be here now. And I will be, I promise.\"\n\n There's a long pause.

You sink a little in your seat, already missing the hour of freedom you had yesterday. You were hoping for another low-effort morning—maybe sneak in some videos or even a nap.\n\nMs. Carter claps her hands once, a gentle cue to tell everyone to quiet down. \"I know, I know,\" she says, smiling sympathetically. \"But we've got some important things to cover.\"\n\nShe pulls out some papers but doesn't hand them out just yet.\n\n\"First order of business, the back-to-school party is this Friday.\"\n\nThere's a ripple of interest across the room as people perk up.\n\n\"It's optional, of course,\" she continues. \"But I highly recommend going.

It happened every year, split by grade level, and wasn't so much about actually celebrating the start of school as it was about catching up on who broke up, who hooked up, and who changed over the summer. It's awkward and chaotic, but also kind of fun.\n\nMs. Carter moves on, glancing at the clock. \"Second thing—clubs. As most of you know, Wednesday is club day here at Pacific Crest. Today we still have homeroom, but starting next week, you'll be reporting to your club during this period.\"\n\nShe pauses and gestures toward the room. \"So now, please take out your laptops and head to the school website.\"\n\nThere's a rustle of movement as everyone digs into their backpacks.\n\n\"Of course, if you're already a club leader, you've got the green light to zone out for a bit,\" she adds, waving her hand lightly. \"Go ahead and scroll TikTok for ten minutes. You've earned it.\"\n\nA few students laugh while a boy in the corner instantly pulls out his phone. You open your laptop and wait for the school website to load, wondering for the first time what kind of club might actually be worth joining this year.\n\n[Choice: Take out your laptop]",

You're not even sure why you chose it—curiosity, maybe. Or something deeper. After everything that's happened with Madame Serena, magic doesn't seem so fake anymore.\n\n If there's a place to get answers... maybe it's there.\n\n \n \n Fashion Club Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n The Fashion Club. You can't help but be a little surprised at yourself. Out of all the options... that's the one you picked?\n\n Maybe it was on a whim or maybe it was out of curiosity. You don't know what you'll find there, but you're willing to find out. In the worst-case scenario, you'll at least be able to coordinate your outfits better.\n\n \n \n Yearbook Club Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n The Yearbook Club. It wasn't the flashiest choice, but there's something comforting about it. Tidy layouts and capturing memories. Organizing the chaos of high school into something neat.\n\n You'll get to decide how people are remembered. Maybe, in a way, you'll figure out how to remember yourself as well.\n \n\nYou lean back in your seat, half-scrolling while the rest of the class finishes up their club forms. The hum of keys clacking, low murmurs of friends chatting, and the occasional groan of someone indecisive fills the room.\n\nEventually, Ms. Carter claps her hands again.\n\n\"Alright, everyone—onto the next thing,\" she announces, glancing around with an apologetic smile. \"I know most of you already have your little cliques locked in, but the school wants to promote inclusivity, so you'll be paired up with someone to be your homeroom partner for the rest of the year.\"\n\nThe groans are immediate.\n\nMs. Carter opts to ignore them and begins rattling off names, one pair at a time. You're not really tuned in, until—\n\n\"...and [name] Yoon, you're with Jessica Sanders.\"\n\nYou blink.\n\nWait.\n\nJessica Sanders?\n\nYou stiffen in your seat, heart thudding louder than you'd like to admit. Out of every name she could've said, everyone in homeroom, why that one? The Jessica Sanders—the girl who's practically the face of Pacific Crest High. Queen Bee. Honor roll student. Head cheerleader. Instagram micro-celebrity. Effortlessly perfect in every way you're not.\n\nAnd now... your partner for the rest of the year.\n\nYou feel the air shift before you even see her. There's a soft tap on your desk.\n\n\"Hey,\" comes a voice, warm and surprisingly light. \"You're [name], right?\"\n\nYou look up—and there she is. Jessica Sanders in the flesh. Ponytail tied back with a maroon bow, her bright blue eyes locked onto yours. She's leaning slightly across the desk, casual and confident. The light streaming in from the window frames her like a movie scene.\n\nYou sit up straighter without meaning to, suddenly feeling inadequate. \"Uh, yeah. That's me.\"\n\nJessica smiles. Not in a smug way like you kinda expect, but something easier. \"Cool! I just wanted to say hi, since we are going to be partners for the rest of the year. Guess we're stuck together now, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" you say. \"I mean—yeah. Looks like it.\"\n\n\"Trust me, I know this is weird,\" she says, shifting her weight as she rests her hand on your desk. \"Random pairings and all, it happens in high school. But I figured I'd introduce myself before we awkwardly sit next to each other every homeroom for the rest of the year.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" you say, letting out a breath of a laugh. \"I was still mentally preparing for that part.\"\n\nJessica chuckles, and the sound feels genuine. \"Yeah, there's no need to worry. I don't bite, I swear.\"\n\nYou're not used to her being like this. You've seen her around a million times—smiling at teachers, laughing with friends, always walking like she knows exactly where she's going. But this version of her feels different. Like she's just another student trying to make the best of an awkward situation.\n\n\"I'm guessing we've never really talked before?\" she asks.\n\nYou shake your head. \"Not really. We've never shared any classes, I think.\"\n\n\"Well, now we've got a homeroom,\" she says before flashing a grin. \"Lucky you.\"\n\nYou snort under your breath, and she seems rather pleased with herself.\n\n\"Anyway,\" she adds, glancing around for an open seat. \"Mind if I sit with you?\"\n\nYou nod, and she slides into the chair beside you, smooth and practiced. You feel the space shift again as she settles in, pulling one leg up to rest over the other.\n\n\"So,\" she says, giving you her full attention. \"Here's a fun question to kick things off: if you could relive any day from your life, which one would you choose?\"\n\nHer question does admittedly catch you off guard—not the kind of thing someone usually leads with. But she's looking at you with genuine curiosity behind her eyes. Like she actually wants to know more about you.

What costume did she put you in?\"\n\n You scratch the back of your neck a little sheepishly. \"It was... kind of silly, honestly. It was a normal storybook character for the most part. But my aunt insisted, and I mean insisted, on adding this big ribbon to my costume. Said it gave the whole look some 'character.' I remember thinking I looked ridiculous.\"\n\n You pause for a moment, letting the memory resurface. You can still remember the soft tug of her brushing your hair, the careful way she tied the bow just right.\n\n \"But I don't know,\" you continue. \"It actually felt nice, in a weird way. Like... being looked after. I guess I just miss that kind of attention sometimes.\"\n\n Jessica watches you for a moment, then gives a little sincere nod. \"I get that. Sometimes it's the silly stuff you don't really think about that sticks with us.\"\n\n \n \n \n \n \n You take a second to think before answering. \"Probably this one summer afternoon when I tagged along with my uncle for the day,\" you say slowly. \"I must've been real young. Nine? Ten, maybe.\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head, listening.\n\n \"It wasn't anything major,\" you continue. \"He just had some errands to run—bank, post office, hardware store, that kind of thing. Stuff I'd usually find boring. But for some reason, he invited me to come with him that day.\"\n\n You smile a little at the memory. \"He let me wear one of his old button-ups so I wouldn't get tanned, and I remember thinking it looked way too big on me. But he rolled up the sleeves and said I looked sharp.\"\n\n You pause, realizing you haven't thought about that in years.\n\n \"I don't know. It was so ordinary, but I felt... not like a kid, exactly. Just included. Like I was allowed to take up space for once. I didn't feel out of place.\"\n\n Jessica watches you, her smile softening into something quieter. \"That actually makes a lot of sense,\" she says. \"The quiet days have a way of sticking with us. Especially when someone makes us feel like we matter.\"\n\n \n \n \"Well,\" you begin with a small smile, \"I think it'd be pretty great to relive the day I won the math olympiad back in middle school.\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow, clearly intrigued.\n\n \"It was one of those team competitions, and we were neck-and-neck with another school. I ended up just barely cracking the final question. But when I did, my team was so excited. Everyone was shouting, the teacher was beaming... I remember just standing there, not really knowing what to do with all that attention.\"\n\n You glance down for a second before looking back at her. \"It felt good to be the one people were proud of, though.\"\n\n \"That actually sounds kind of amazing,\" Jessica says, a warm smile on her lips. \"You must've felt unstoppable.\"\n\n \n \n \"Let's see... I think I'd go back to this one soccer game I played in as a kid,\" you say with a small laugh. \"It was one of those community league matches—really nothing huge—but I ended up scoring the winning goal right at the end.\"\n\n You pause for a moment, the memory coming back clearer than you expected.\n\n \"Everyone rushed me after. My teammates, the coach—even some parents were cheering. It was like we'd won the World Cup or something. It was chaotic, but in the best way possible. I felt... like I actually mattered, even just for a few minutes.\"\n\n \"That sounds incredible,\" Jessica says, resting her chin in her hand. \"There's something different about those early ones, don't you think?\"\n \n\n\"Thanks for understanding,\" you murmur, suddenly feeling bashful.\n\nYou glance over at her, her blue eyes still fixed on you.\n\n\"But what about you?\" you ask, shifting in your seat. \"What day would you go back to?\"\n\nJessica blinks—just once, but it's clear the question catches her off guard. She opens her mouth, then hesitates. For a second, you think that she'll just brush it off with a joke or change the subject.\n\nBut instead, she leans back and exhales softly, her voice quieting a little.\n\n\"I guess... maybe one of the afternoons I used to spend at my grandma's place,\" she says quickly. \"We didn't do anything dramatic. Just baked cookies, folded laundry, and watched old game shows.\"\n\nShe twirls the end of her ponytail once, a faint smile pulling at the corner of her mouth.\n\n\"I don't know. It just felt so easy. No pressure or deadlines, just someone who was proud of me no matter what.\"\n\nThere's a beat of silence. Then, as if remembering herself, she waves it off with a laugh. \"Okay, wow, that got a little sappy. You're a bad influence already, [name].\"\n\n\"No, that sounds really nice,\" you say, shaking your head. \"It's kind of rare, isn't it? Having someone who's proud of you for existing.\"\n\nJessica glances over at you, and her smile this time is warmer.\n\n\"Thanks,\" she says. \"Look at you. Not even nervous anymore. I'm really not that scary.\"\n\nYou grin. Maybe she's not what you expected. Maybe she's more.\n\n[Choice: Continue on with your day]",

L and P were close enough. Puke it was.\n\n\"Yeah, well,\" Luke says, smirking. \"I'm about to puke all over the anime girl on your shirt if you keep talking.\"\n\n\"Try it and I swear to God I'll replace your shampoo with ranch,\" Samantha fires back.\n\nThey burst into laughter, and for a second, it feels like everything is normal.\n\nLuke finally recovers and turns to you, still chuckling. \"How about you, [name]?

      "text": "You start your analysis by focusing on Gregor's physical transformation—how he wakes up as a giant bug, but instead of freaking out, his first thought is about missing work. You jot down how that actually says a lot about who he is as a person. He doesn't see himself as a human being with wants or feelings—just a worker, someone who exists to meet expectations. His whole sense of self is tied up in what he can do for other people.\n\n And as you keep writing, you feel your mind start to wander.\n\n You didn't mean to think about yourself, but... yeah. It hits close to home. You've been changing too—not into a bug, of course—but in a way that's just as hard to explain. You still feel like you, at least at the moment. But sometimes when you look in the mirror, the face staring back doesn't match how you think you should look. And you can't help but wonder—how long until people start seeing you differently because of it?\n\n You pause, staring at the blinking cursor on your monitor for a moment.\n\n Then you keep typing. There's still more to say about Gregor, and you do have to focus on your homework. But in the back of your mind, a quiet thought settles in: What if people only see the changes... and not the person underneath?\n\n \n You decide to focus on the theme of alienation—how Gregor is no longer seen as part of the world he once belonged to the moment he transforms. His voice becomes unintelligible. His family recoils from him. Even though he's still himself inside, the same Gregor Samsa, no one seems able—or willing—to see that. He becomes a burden. An inconvenience. Something to be ignored.\n\n As you write, you find yourself slowing down a little.\n\n Because it hits too close.\n\n You haven't told your family about what's been happening to you. The transformations may be subtle for now, but they're very real. You see them. You feel them. And even though most people haven't noticed, it's like a wall has gone up between you and them.\n\n You haven't even changed much... but somehow, you already feel a little more distant.\n\n A little more alone.\n\n And the longer you keep it to yourself, the more it feels like you're becoming something they wouldn't recognize.\n\n \n You decide to center your analysis on the crushing weight of family expectations and the sense of duty Gregor feels. What stands out isn't just that Gregor turns into an insect—it's that his first instinct isn't fear or confusion. It's panic that he's going to miss work. That he's going to disappoint his boss and his parents. That his absence might jeopardize his household.\n\n It's like his entire worth has been boiled down to a mere paycheck. His body might be unrecognizable, but that doesn't matter. What matters is he can't go to work. That he can't perform.\n\n And you can't help but feel a twinge of recognition.\n\n You're changing too. Not as drastically as Gregor, but enough that it's hard not to wonder what people will think if they notice. If you stop being what they expect. What they need.\n\n You're even sure who \"they\" is—your mom, your friends, your teacher. Hell, maybe even yourself.\n\n Gregor's story makes you wonder: if you stop meeting expectations, will the people who say they care still care at all? Or are you only valuable for what you can provide?\n\n You chew the end of your pen for a moment, unsure how to finish the paragraph. You don't write the last part down.\n\n But it stays with you.\n\n \n You decide to focus your analysis on the breakdown of communication—how Gregor's transformation doesn't just change his body, but doesn't let him connect with the people closest to him.\n\n One of the first things that happens is that his voice changes, and suddenly his family, who's right outside his bedroom door, can't even understand him. He's still there. Still thinking. Still feeling. But no one can hear him. No one gets him.\n\n And the worst part? They stop trying.\n\n You sit with that for a moment. It hits a little closer to home than you expected.\n\n You think about your own transformation—the changes, the secrecy, how every day it feels harder to just talk to the people around you. You're still you, but there's this growing distance. Like there's something big and important that you can't bring up sitting between you and everyone else. So you don't.\n\n You don't put that in your paper. But you feel it anyway.\n \n\nYou finish your homework, reread it once, and then shut down your computer. You lean back in your chair and let out a long sigh. The weight of Gregor's story, your story, and the weird parallels linger in your mind.\n\nWhy this book, out of all the ones your teacher could've picked? Why not something lighter? Something with dragons, or magic, or a happy ending. But no. It had to be The Metamorphosis—a story about a guy who wakes up one day changed and slowly becomes unrecognizable to everyone around him.\n\nMaybe tomorrow will be easier.\n\nOr maybe it won't.\n\nEither way, you'll get through it. One weird transformation at a time.\n\n[Choice: Choose what to do next]",

I'm already on round two 'cause I smudged my thumb trying to send that first message.\"\n\nYou hear her blow gently, probably fanning the polish dry. For someone you barely knew a few days ago, she's surprisingly easy to talk to.\n\n\"So,\" she continues, her voice playful. \"Now that we're officially homeroom partners, I figured I should, y'know, make the effort. Team bonding and all that.\"\n\nYou chuckle. \"Didn't know homeroom partners were supposed to bond.\"\n\n\"Duh, of course we are,\" she says. \"We're sitting together every morning for the rest of the year. That's basically a relationship.\"\n\n\"That's one way to look at it.\"\n\nThere's a pause, then a long sigh from her end. \"Anyway, I've been kind of losing it over cheer stuff today.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah?\"\n\n\"Mandy left. Like—just gone. Moved to Iowa. Who does that? No offense to Iowa, but... actually no, full offense to Iowa. Why would you voluntarily live there?\"\n\n\"What happened?\" you ask.\n\n\"She transferred schools,\" Jessica grumbles. \"And now we're short a cheerleader, and no one who's tried out can even do a proper toe touch.

You exhale, a little tension easing from your shoulders. It seems you're in the clear for now.\n\nYou turn toward the shower and reach for the knob, twisting it until the pipes groan. A few beats later, the water sputters and then rushes out, slowly climbing in temperature. While it heats up, you start peeling off your clothes—tossing your shirt onto the counter, stepping out of your cargo shorts, and finally kicking them into the corner with your foot.\n\nYou step into the shower, and the blast of heat against your skin scalds the stress away. You take your time as you scrub down. Not because you particularly enjoy showering, but because being clean somehow makes everything else feel less chaotic.\n\nWhen you reach for your shampoo and give the bottle a firm squeeze... nothing.\n\nYou frown and shake it, trying again. A sad sputter of air and the faintest blob barely make it into your palm. You pop the cap and peer inside. There's barely anything left.\n\nYou let out a loud sigh and glance at the collection of bottles on the shelves, scanning for a backup. Your sister's shampoo stands out—bright pink, floral-print label, and the name \"Bloom Petal Kiss.\"\n\nThe bottle is completely full.

You let the water rinse the suds from your hair as your mind spins. The curse reacts to feminine actions—and it seems that Lily's \"Bloom Petal Kiss\" shampoo counted.\n\n You finish up the shower quickly, fingers a little shaky as you dry off. You'll deal with what changed later. For now, the most you can do is to try and act like everything's fine... and maybe get some gender-neutral shampoo.\n\n \n You stare at the nearly empty shampoo bottle in your hand, then at your sister's full one. The floral label practically sparkles under the bathroom light, almost like it's mocking you.\n\n You eye the bottle like it's rigged with a trap. You have no idea what counts as \"girly\" enough to trigger whatever magical nonsense Madame Serena put on you, and you're not about to find out in the middle of your shower. Using your sister's shampoo would be tempting fate.\n\n So, with a sigh, you pop open the cap and march it under the running water, filling it up a little then shaking it.

You lather it into your hair, but it barely foams and barely smells like anything.\n\n By the time you rinse out the last of the bubbles, you're not sure if your hair is clean or just wet and confused.\n\n Still, a shower's a shower.\n\n You turn off the faucet and step out, drying yourself off and throwing on your clothes.

She's in her usual getup—striped sleeves layered under a black graphic tee, loose jeans, and her signature beanie perched just over her bangs.

Somehow, though, it doesn't look lazy—just distinctly Samantha.\n\nThe moment she sees you and Luke walking up, her face lights up.\n\n\"Finally,\" she announces, hands on her hips. \"You both showed up.

Like, chill but strong.\"\n\n\"I don't even know how to respond to that.\"\n\n\"Dog vibes are in,\" you add, mostly just to back him up.\n\nSamantha raises a brow at you. \"Don't encourage him.\"\n\nYou shrug with a sheepish grin. \"I think it looks good.\"\n\n\"See?\" Luke beams. \"[name] gets it.\"\n\n\"God help me,\" Samantha mutters, pinching the bridge of her nose. \"Anyway, let's get going. We need to be smart about this. We'll hit the clothes store after we warm up with a few fun ones. You two can pick where.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" she pauses mid-step. \"Money check. Please tell me you didn't come here just to loiter.\"\n\nYou pull out your phone and double-check. \"I got some extra money from my mom. She pitched in fifty bucks.\"\n\n\"Perfect.\" She gives you an approving nod, then swivels toward Luke. \"And what about you?\"\n\nHe digs into his pocket, then pulls out a slightly crumpled ten-dollar bill and an unopened mini-pack of Skittles.\n\n\"There's this,\" he says, like he's presenting a rare treasure. \"And this. Emergency snacks.\"\n\nSamantha stares at him for a few seconds, dumbfounded. \"You... you brought ten bucks and candy to a fashion mission?\"\n\n\"Gotta stay energized,\" he says. His grin doesn't falter.\n\nShe opens her mouth, closes it, then shakes her head slowly. \"I'm not even mad. I'm just—no, actually, I am mad. But also impressed. But mostly mad.\"\n\nYou laugh under your breath.\n\n\"I'll pick the actual stores later,\" she declares, motioning ahead. \"But to be a merciful goddess, I'll let you two choose three fun places to hit first. Then it's fashion boot camp.\"\n\n\"I pick Games for Life!\" Luke exclaims immediately.\n\n\"You didn't even wait,\" Samantha sighs.\n\nLuke grins. \"Didn't need to.

It's striking, its vibrant color immediately catching the eye with the fabric flowing smoothly around her figure. The dress features a V-neckline and a waist-cinching tie that accentuates her curves. It's knee-length, with short sleeves that make it perfect for the back-to-school party.\n\n\"Little daring, but the color is really nice,\" Samantha says, looking at herself in the mirror. \"I'll be right back, let me try on the next outfit.\"\n\nSamantha comes back a minute later with a flowy, bohemian-style maxi dress covered in delicate floral patterns. It's sleeveless with a high, modest neckline, with a relaxed fit that gently draped over her. The dress is ankle-length and is ideal for a nice day out. Its soft pastel tones give it an ethereal quality.\n\n\"Not sure if it matches the season, but it is super comfy and cute,\" Samantha sways back and forth, her fingers running through the soft fabric. \"Remember this one, okay?

It's sleek and simple, with a subtle sweetheart neckline and sleeveless design. It's perfect for almost every event, especially a back-to-school party.

The motion is casual, but you notice a few people across the room looking your way, probably wondering the same thing you are.\n\n\"Wait, you're sitting here now?\" you ask, trying to keep your voice even.\n\nJessica glances around, completely unbothered. \"Yeah, why?\"\n\nYou hesitate. \"No reason. Just... didn't think you would.\"\n\nShe stretches her legs under the desk and leans back like she's been sitting next to you all year. \"We're partners now, right? For homeroom? Might as well stick together.\"\n\n\"Fair enough,\" you say, nodding.\n\nYou're about to say something else—maybe a joke, maybe a thank you—but before the words come out, the sharp and familiar school bell rings. The classroom quiets down as everyone settles in, and a moment later, Ms. Carter claps her hands from the front of the room.\n\n\"Okay, homeroom family,\" she says with a cheerful energy that sounds way too alert for this early in the day. \"Today, we're starting something new—your personal reflection journals!\"\n\nThere's a groan from somewhere in the back, but Ms. Carter powers through it with a smile.\n\n\"You'll be filling out several entries throughout the year, and then looking back on them at the end. These are for you, so take them seriously. The school actually invested a fair bit into these, so please take care of them.\"\n\nShe begins walking around the classroom, handing out plain brown journals one by one. They're nothing fancy—just softcovers with a built-in bookmark ribbon—but they have a bit of weight to them, like something meant to last. You flip yours over in your hands when she sets it on your desk, inspecting the smooth cover and the stitched binding.\n\n\"As part of this project, you'll sometimes be given prompts to reflect on,\" she continues, making her way back to the front. \"After you write your entry, you'll read a short excerpt aloud to your partner and have a brief discussion. Nothing too scary—I just want you to be thoughtful and open-minded with each other.\"\n\nJessica leans over and raises an eyebrow. \"Guess that makes us journal buddies now too,\" she whispers.\n\n\"I didn't even know that was a thing,\" you reply, smirking.\n\nMs. Carter powers on her laptop. The projector hums to life, casting a blue glow across the whiteboard before it flickers and displays her screen. A moment later, several bullet-pointed questions appear, each one designed to pry just a little deeper than your average school assignment.\n\n\"These are the questions I want you to answer today,\" Ms. Carter says. \"Take your time and be honest. You've got most of the block to work on this.\"\n\n[Choice: Look at the first question]",

Because I kinda have to be. Like, if something goes wrong during a cheer routine, you've got half a second to fix it before someone falls or twists their ankle or the whole pyramid collapses. So I guess I've just... trained myself to be cool about it. On the outside, at least.\"\n\nShe picks at the edge of her journal page with one neatly manicured nail. \"And for the last question... what I want to do in the future.\" She exhales, the first real break in her flow. \"That one was harder.\"\n\n\"How come?\" you ask, tilting your head.\n\nJessica gives a wry little laugh. \"Probably because I don't really know. I wrote that I want to do something with media or communications. Maybe work in fashion or marketing. Something where I get to travel and be seen. But...\" She pauses, then adds in a softer voice. \"Sometimes I wonder if that's what I want, or if it's just what I'm supposed to want. You know?\"\n\nYou nod slowly.\n\nShe quickly brightens again, like she's flipping a switch. \"Anyway. I figure I've got time to figure it out, right? Senior year is for experimenting, after all.\"\n\nThe mask is back—subtle, but there.\n\nShe leans toward you, resting her chin on her hand. \"Okay, your turn. What'd you put down, mystery partner?\"\n\n \n You clear your throat. \"Well, for the first one, I kept it kind of vague. I wrote that I'm not really sure who I am right now.\"\n\n Jessica's brows raise a little at that, but she doesn't say anything—just tilts her head, listening.\n\n \"I guess... I feel like I'm in this weird in-between space,\" you continue, choosing your words carefully. \"People still treat me like I haven't changed, like I'm the same guy I've always been. But lately, I don't really feel that way. It's like something is shifting. I don't know. I didn't go super deep into it, but that's the gist of it.\"\n\n Jessica hums thoughtfully, her gaze drifting toward the front of the classroom for a second before returning to you. \"That's kind of deep,\" she says softly, almost like she wasn't expecting it. \"I get that though... sometimes it's not easy to pin yourself down when things are moving under the surface.\"\n\n You nod, grateful she doesn't push further. She doesn't need to know what's really going on. Not yet, at least.\n\n \n You let out a small breath through your nose and lean back a bit. \"My answer to the first question was kind of boring,\" you admit. \"I just said I'm the same as always. Nothing special.\"\n\n Jessica gives a little smirk. \"Define 'boring.'\"\n\n \"I don't know. I hang out with Luke and Samantha. I mess around. Try not to take things too seriously,\" you say with a shrug. \"I've got this one annoying problem going on, but I'm hoping I can get past it soon and move on.\"\n\n Jessica taps her pen against her desk. \"Sounds nice, honestly. Stable.\" There's something behind her tone that you can't quite make out.\n\n You glance over at her, then down at your journal. \"Not sure how long I'll feel that way, though?\"\n\n Jessica doesn't respond right away, but her smile softens just a little. Maybe she understands more than she lets on.\n\n \n You run a hand through your hair, trying to find the right words. \"I said that I feel like I'm evolving.\"\n\n Jessica blinks, surprised—but intrigued. \"Evolving?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you nod slowly. \"I know it sounds kind of dramatic, but... I just feel like I'm not the same person I was even a few days ago. Something's changing, and I don't know what it is yet. But it feels like I'm heading somewhere new, even if I can't quite see it yet.\"\n\n Jessica's eyes narrow, not in judgment, but in contemplation. \"That's kind of cool,\" she says finally. \"Most people don't even notice when they're changing. If you think about it, you're already ahead of the curve.\"\n\n \"Or I'm just confused,\" you murmur, shrugging.\n\n She laughs at that. \"Same thing.\"\n \n\nYou glance down at your journal for a second before answering. The second question was about how you adapt to unexpected challenges.\n\n \n \"For the second one, I wrote that I usually try to break things down,\" you say. \"Like, I need to understand what's going on before I react.\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow. \"You're a thinker, huh?\"\n\n \"Yeah, I guess I am,\" you reply. \"Even when stuff gets weird or overwhelming, I like to look at the facts. Whether it's a test or something I don't totally understand, I want to make sense of it first. That really helps me to stay calm.\"\n\n \"That sounds... kind of grounding,\" she says, nodding slowly. \"Like you don't let your emotions take over.\"\n\n You tilt your head. \"Well, I certainly try not to. It doesn't always work, though.\"\n\n She smiles faintly, like she appreciates the honesty. \"Still. Beats spiraling.\"\n\n \n \"I put down that I usually rely on my body when things go sideways,\" you say, stretching your legs out a little beneath the desk. \"Not like, fight-or-flight, just that I'm used to dealing with challenges physically. Sports, movement... that kind of thing.\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow, intrigued. \"So, what does that mean? Do you, like, throw yourself at problems?\"\n\n \"Not literally,\" you reply, letting out a small laugh. \"But when I'm in a tough spot, I get moving. I think better when I'm doing something. Playing volleyball or going for a run—anything that helps me feel grounded. My body knows what to do before my head catches up sometimes.\"\n\n \"You know,\" Jessica begins, tapping her pen against her journal, \"I kind of envy that. I overthink everything. Sometimes I feel like I get stuck in my head and forget I even have a body.\"\n\n You smile. \"That happens to me too, sometimes. But I've learned that if I keep myself moving, even just stretching, it helps the rest fall into place. Physical momentum turns into mental momentum.\"\n\n Jessica looks thoughtful at that, her gaze drifting. \"Makes sense. I guess we all have different ways of staying steady when things get weird.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, meeting her eyes for a moment. \"Whatever keeps you balanced, right?\"\n\n She nods, then looks back down at her journal, the corner of her mouth twitching like she's turning something over in her head.\n\n \n \"I wrote that I try to talk my way through things,\" you say, giving a small shrug. \"I'm usually good at reading people, so I use that to my advantage.\"\n\n Jessica perks up slightly. \"Really?\"\n\n \"Yeah. When things get unpredictable, I pay attention to how people are reacting. I try to understand what they're feeling and work with that. It's easier when you're not alone in it.\"\n\n She considers that, a flicker of something unreadable crossing her face. \"You sound like a counselor or something.\"\n\n You chuckle. \"Maybe. I think people underestimate how much a conversation can solve.\"\n\n Jessica nods. \"No kidding.\"\n\n There's a pause between you, a quiet understanding hanging in the air. Maybe she knows what it's like to hide behind words, too.\n\n \n \"I said I usually lean on my popularity,\" you say with a half-smile, knowing how it sounds. \"If something unexpected happens, I can usually shrug it off. People don't expect me to be shaken up, so I just play the part.\"\n\n Jessica's expression shifts—interest, surprise, maybe even a sliver of recognition. \"Wow. Honest answer.\"\n\n You shrug. \"It works. People like confidence. And if you act like everything's fine, most of the time, they believe it.\"\n\n \"Trust me,\" Jessica says, giving a short laugh. \"I get it.\"\n\n You glance sideways at her. \"Yeah, I figured you might.\"\n\n Her smile lingers for a beat longer than usual, but it doesn't quite reach her eyes. \"Confidence really can be a good mask.\"\n\n You don't say anything right away. Maybe because you're not sure what's under yours either.\n \n\n \n You glance down at your journal, fingers drumming lightly against the edge. \"For the last question, I said I want to go to a good college. Hopefully one with a strong STEM program.\"\n\n \"Ooh,\" Jessica says, perking up. \"What kind of STEM?\"\n\n \"Well, I'm not totally sure yet,\" you admit. \"Maybe some sort of engineering? Something that'll land me a job when all of this is over.\"\n\n She nods slowly. \"So you're the responsible type.\"\n\n \"I guess?\" you say, uncertain. \"What I really want are options. Scholarships, stability, you know? It's competitive, but I'm willing to put in the work.\"\n\n \"That's cool,\" she says, expression softening in a way that doesn't quite reach her eyes. \"Must be nice, knowing what you want.\"\n\n You glance over at her, curious about the edge in her voice, but she looks away before you can get a good read. The smile she gives you next is practiced and perfect, but maybe just a little tired.\n\n \n You shift in your seat. Jessica's looking at you expectantly, one eyebrow raised.\n\n \"I wasn't sure how to put it exactly,\" you finally say. \"But for the last question, I wrote about how I've been thinking of doing something more active after high school.\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head. \"Like sports?\"\n\n \"Sort of,\" you say, scratching the back of your neck. \"But not in the typical way. I don't mean, like, going pro or anything like that. It's just I've been realizing that I actually really like the physical side of things. Moving. Being in sync with a group. Feeling strong, coordinated, and sharp. I don't think I've ever appreciated that part of myself before.\"\n\n \"Huh,\" she says, studying you for a beat. \"That's kind of surprising, actually. You don't seem like the... movement type.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I know,\" you grin. \"I'm usually the type of guy who just chills in the background. But lately, I've been thinking it might be nice to... I don't know. Be more visible. Do something that pushes me.\"\n\n \"Pushing yourself can be good,\" she says, her voice thoughtful. \"And being a part of a group like that? It's underrated. There's something addictive about it, when it clicks.\"\n\n You blink. \"You say that like you've experienced it.\"\n\n Jessica just shrugs, her nails catching the light. \"Maybe I have.\"\n\n \n You hesitate, then speak carefully. \"I said I'm not totally sure, but I've been drawn to... the unexplained. Weird stuff. Hidden knowledge. I know that sounds kind of out there.\"\n\n Jessica blinks. \"Out there how? Like conspiracy theories? Or, like, crystals and incense?\"\n\n You laugh under your breath. \"More like... mysteries. Things people don't talk about. The stuff behind the curtain.\"\n\n \"Kind of spooky, don't you think?\" she asks, intrigued but guarded.\n\n You shrug. \"Maybe it is. But it feels... important somehow. I don't know what it means yet. I just want to follow that thread and see where it goes.\"\n\n Jessica pauses, tapping her nails against her journal. \"That's... actually kind of cool. Like your own mystery novel or something.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you reply, smiling faintly. \"I guess I just want to understand things that don't make sense. Or maybe understand myself.\"\n\n She nods, a flicker of something unreadable in her gaze, before she glances away. \"Well, if you uncover any secrets of the universe, let me know.\"\n\n \n You clear your throat. \"I, uh... I wrote that I might want to try something performative. Theater, maybe. Dance.\"\n\n Jessica's eyes widen. \"Really? That's a plot twist.\"\n\n You laugh, a little embarrassed. \"Yeah, I've never actually done it before, but lately... I've been thinking about it. It's scary, but kind of exciting too.\"\n\n She smiles, a little softer than usual. \"I totally get that. There's something really powerful about being able to express yourself on a stage. Like you can be loud in ways you're not allowed to be in real life.\"\n\n \"Exactly!\" you exclaim, surprised by how easily she put it into words. \"It's not even about being seen, really. It's more about... having space to figure yourself out. In front of people, sure, but also just... for yourself.\"\n\n Jessica looks thoughtful for a second. \"You should do it. Seriously. If you ever want to try out, let me know. I can get you in.\"\n\n \"You're part of the theater department too?\" you ask.\n\n \"No,\" she says before grinning. \"But I have connections.\"\n\n \n \"For the third question, I said I want to do something creative,\" you say. \"Art, maybe. I'm not super good at it or anything, but it's been pulling at me.\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head. \"Like painting?\"\n\n \"Yeah, maybe. Drawing. Designing. Just anything that lets me make something that feels like me, I guess.\"\n\n She smiles at that. \"That's beautiful. I think everyone wishes they could do that.\"\n\n \"I don't know if I'll ever be great at it,\" you say, rubbing your neck. \"But lately, it's been one of the only things that feels... right. Like I'm allowed to make things just for the sake of it.\"\n\n Jessica's eyes drift for a moment, deep in thought. \"That's rare, you know? Most people don't even let themselves admit they want that.\"\n\n \"What about you?\" you ask.\n\n She waves you off with a laugh that doesn't quite match her expression. \"I'm too much of a control freak. I'd probably lose my mind with a blank canvas.\"\n \n But something in her tone makes you think she's not telling the whole truth.\n \n\nJessica leans back in her chair, and for a second, she doesn't say anything. She just gives you this quiet, thoughtful look like she's trying to read more between the lines but doesn't want to push.\n\nThen she smiles. Not her usual dazzling, performative kind of smile, but something softer. \"Thanks for sharing that,\" she says gently. \"You didn't have to, at least not in this much detail, but... I'm glad you did.\"\n\nYou shrug, trying to play it off. \"Felt right, I guess.\"\n\n\"Sometimes it's easier to write this stuff than say it out loud, huh?\"\n\nYou glance down at your own writing, the words still fresh and a little raw. \"Yeah. Definitely.\"\n\nMs. Carter's voice rises again from the front of the room, giving a few reminders as the activity winds down. You and Jessica both look forward, journals still open in your hands.\n\nEverything should be the same, but something feels a little different now.\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Her smile is way too pleased with itself for it to be anything good.\n\n\"Guess where we are going today!\" she declares.\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Let me guess. The DMV.\"\n\nShe ignores you. \"The mall.\"\n\nLuke looks up from his tray, mouth full of food and eyes blank. \"Wait, like... all of us?\"\n\n\"Yeah, genius. You, me, and [name]. The holy trinity.\" She points her fork at each of you like she's casting a spell. \"The coolest group in school, obviously.\"\n\nLuke blinks. \"Since when are we the coolest group in school?\"\n\nSamantha sighs. \"Since I said so. Keep up.\"\n\n\"Well, I always thought we were somewhere in the above-average but forgettable range,\" Luke mutters, furrowing his brow like he's doing math in his head. \"Y'know, like... the background characters in a teen drama.\"\n\n\"Okay, Puke,\" Samantha says, whacking him lightly on the back of the head. \"First of all, no more talking. Second of all, you are singlehandedly dragging our social status into the dirt with that attitude.\"\n\nLuke nearly chokes on his juice. \"Why do I always get called Puke?!\"\n\n\"It is kinda catchy,\" you say.\n\nSamantha leans back in her chair like she's surveying her empire. \"Anyway. We're going shopping. For the back-to-school party. I need clothes. You need clothes. Luke especially needs clothes.\"\n\n\"Hey!\" Luke looks down at his T-shirt, which has a dog wearing a baseball cap backwards. \"...Okay, valid, but still rude.\"\n\n\"We're going,\" Samantha says, stabbing a baby carrot for emphasis. \"No complaints. No excuses. No, 'I'm busy walking my hamster' or 'I'm allergic to capitalism.' You're coming.\"\n\nLuke raises a tentative hand like a student in class. \"What if I'm—\"\n\n\"No,\" she interrupts.\n\n\"I didn't even say what I was gonna say yet!\"\n\n\"You were going to say 'what if I'm busy,' and then list a schedule consisting of video games, snacks, and watching that YouTuber who reviews cheese.\"\n\nLuke looks genuinely offended. \"First of all, his name is CheddarDan and he's educational.\"\n\nSamantha turns to you with a deadpan stare. \"[name], please tell me you're smarter than this one.\"\n\nYou shrug, trying not to smile. \"I mean, I'm free.\"\n\n\"See?\" she says, triumphant, gesturing at you like she just won custody of you after a messy divorce. \"Be more like [name].\"\n\nLuke sighs, clearly defeated, but trying to hold onto some semblance of pride. \"Fine. I'll go. But if anyone tries to put me in a sparkly top, I'm leaving.\"\n\n\"No promises,\" Samantha says, grinning. \"I think you'd look adorable in glitter.\"\n\n\"I think I'd rather die.\"\n\nYou watch them bicker back and forth with the ease of longtime friends, and honestly? As chaotic as it sounds, the idea of spending an afternoon with them at the mall... doesn't sound half bad. Even if someone ends up getting glitter in their eyes. Probably Luke. Definitely Luke.\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "<<if [feminineLooks] > 9>> \n As you make your way through the crowded hallway, you catch a shift in the usual noise—just enough to notice. A small group of girls huddled by the lockers glance your way mid-conversation, and you hear your name in the mix, soft but unmistakable. When your eyes meet theirs, the chatter cuts off instantly, replaced by awkward smiles and diverted gazes. You keep walking, pretending not to notice, but something prickles under your skin. You're not sure what they were saying, but you're pretty sure it was about you.\n\n \n You move through the hallway toward your next class, the usual mix of sneakers squeaking and voices speaking echoing off the walls. No one spares you a second glance. It's just another ordinary shuffle between periods, and you're just another face in the crowd.\n \n\nSomeone suddenly steps into your path.\n\nYou stop abruptly, blinking in surprise as your eyes meet hers.\n\nAurora Rowan.\n\nShe stands directly in front of you, blocking your way with unnerving precision. Her outfit is all black, the fabric hugging her frame in crisp, clean lines. Silver jewelry gleams at her wrists and ears, and her hair catches the sunlight filtering through the hallway window.\n\nBefore you can say a word, she raises a finger to her lips.\n\n\"Shh,\" she breathes.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Meet Aurora Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n\nYour breath catches. She's close and her voice is quiet but charged, like the stillness before a thunderclap.\n\nHer eyes scan your face like she's memorizing every line of it. Then she tilts her head slightly, her lips curling into something between curiosity and certainty. \"You're changing,\" she says softly, but there's no question in it. Just fact.\n\nYour throat tightens. \"I—I don't know what you're talking about,\" you manage, the words clumsy as they leave your mouth.\n\nAurora just arches a brow. \"You do. Maybe not everything. Not yet. But something's already shifting.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'shifting'?\" you ask, taking a step back.\n\nShe lets her oddly knowing gaze wander over you, then meets your eyes again. \"You feel it, don't you? Like something's unraveling.\"\n\nYou swallow hard. The hallway suddenly feels too quiet, too still.\n\n\"How do you even—\" you start to ask, but she cuts you off with a small motion of her hand.\n\n\"I see magic,\" she says simply. \"The real kind of magic. The kind that weaves itself into people. And you...\" Her eyes narrow just slightly, like she's watching something take shape behind your skin. \"You're wrapped in it. Not cursed, not really. Just... waking up.\"\n\nYou freeze.\n\nAurora isn't guessing. She knows.\n\nYour voice feels small in your throat. \"What am I supposed to do?\"\n\nAurora studies you for a long moment, like she's weighing how much to say. Then a slow, almost sad smile tugs at the corner of her mouth. She's not pitying you, but she does know something.\n\n\"When you're ready to stop fighting it, come find me,\" she says, her voice softer now. \"I can help you understand what this really is. But be careful. The longer you resist, the harder it'll be to hear what your heart's been trying to tell you.\"\n\nShe steps back, the sunlight glinting off the silver on her wrists. She turns, and by the time your eyes follow, she's already slipping into the passing tide of students. One blink, and she's gone—no trace, no silhouette.\n\nYou're left standing there, not quite knowing what to think. Maybe you would take her up on her offer and seek her out later, but for now, you had to get to class.\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Your friends believe you, and you feel a weight lifted off your shoulders. \"Let's just keep going and discuss this another time though.\"\n\n \"I'll respect that, but we are going to have to talk about this at some point, okay?\" Samantha demands.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

I like your guts, so I'll give you some advice. Make sure you push yourself but don't do it for others. That type of motivation won't last. Remember first and foremost it's about you.\"\n \n\nYou spot the gym door swinging open and Samantha steps into the party, looking around for you.\n\n\"Oh, I have to go now,\" you quickly wave goodbye and make your way to Samantha.\n\n\"Hey, [name],\" Samantha greets you. \"Come on, let's get Luke now.\"\n\n[Choice: Go take back Luke]",

The speakers crackle with static before a voice comes out.\n\n\"Alright, everyone,\" the DJ, who's actually just a teacher, announces. \"It's time to cap off the night with our last dance. Find a partner, someone you'd like to share this moment with and let's make it a night to remember!\"\n\nYou watch as couples begin to take the floor, your heart starting to beat a little faster as you contemplate what you should do.

      "text": "You decide to keep things chill and do your best to match Luke's playful energy. You mimic his goofy dance moves, throwing in a crazy breakdancing move just for fun. There's honestly something comforting about how carefree your best friend is, so you roll with it. \n\n \"There we go, [name],\" Luke says with a wide grin on his face. \"Good job, we're seriously going to be legends after this.\"\n\n \"Yeah, we are!\" you reply. You look around to see some amused glances from your peers, but that just makes you laugh harder. Your worries about how people might see you fade as you lose yourself in the moment.\n\n \"Now presenting the kings of the dance floor!\" Luke says in an exaggerated tone, trying to imitate a narrator. He swings into a dramatic spin and stops in a weird pose, gesturing for you to follow suit. You try to do the same, but end up clumsily stumbling a little. You continue the playful back-and-forth, as the both of you build on the other's jokes. The dance moves get sillier and sillier until what you're doing is almost unrecognizable as a dance move. \n\n \"Damn, we're the best!\" you yell, the both of you radiating carefree energy. You attempt a dramatic dance move, but end up bumping into Luke.\n\n \"Woah, careful!\" Luke says, stumbling a little. \"Let's not get injured today.\"\n\n You straighten yourself up, shaking your head at how ridiculous the whole thing has become. But the energy you and Luke have been giving off seems to be contagious, as other students begin joining in with some weird moves as well. By the time the song ends, the two of you are breathless from laughing so much. You feel lighter than you have in a while, and a smile is plastered on your face.\n\n \"What did I say, huh?\" Luke says. \"I told you we'd be legends.\"\n\n \"Legends of bad dancing, sure,\" you say. \n\n The two of you laugh as you leave the dance floor, having stolen the spotlight for a few minutes. As you walk away, some of your peers give you approving nods and high-fives, and you feel elated.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As the music shifts into a slower, more intimate rhythm, you can't help but hesitate for a moment. You glance at Luke, who looks a bit awkward but smiles encouragingly. The atmosphere in the gym has shifted, the lights dimming slightly as couples around you begin to sway to the softer tune. You take a breath, deciding to close the distance between you and Luke. You step closer, your bodies now just a few inches apart. The proximity feels different, but not bad. Luke's eyes widen a little, but he doesn't pull away from you. There's just a quiet understanding between the two of you, an unspoken agreement to just go with the flow.\n\n \"Guess this is what we're doing now, huh?\" you chuckle nervously.\n\n \"Hey, you're the one who wanted to dance closer,\" Luke replies.\n\n The music wraps around you, and for a moment, the world outside the two of you fades away. You feel the warmth radiating between you and Luke, and although it's a new feeling, it's one that's oddly comforting. You've known Luke for ages now, and there's something grounding about being here with him. As you sway to the rhythm, your movements are slower and more in sync with the mood of the song. Luke's hands rest on your shoulders, and you place your own hands around his waist. It's still a bit awkward, but you make it work. \n\n \"Careful, [name],\" Luke teases. \"I use my body for ramming into people, not dancing, so I might not be the best at dancing.\"\n\n \"I'm not the best at dancing either,\" you laugh. \"Guess we're a disaster waiting to happen.\"\n\n The awkwardness starts to disappear and everything starts to feel quite natural. It fully dissolves, and what remains is a sense of calm. You can feel the subtle rise and fall of his breath, his broad chest against yours, and the two of you just dance. You're fully engrossed in the moment, and right now, the only person in the world that matters is Luke.\n\n \"You know, this isn't as bad as I thought it'd be,\" Luke says.\n\n \"It's really not,\" you whisper back.\n\n The song draws to a close, and the final notes of the melody hang in the air as you glance at Luke, who's grinning widely. Your eyes meet for a second, your brown eyes meeting his gray ones. You quickly glance away, your heart pounding and cheeks flushing. What was this feeling? You'd been friends with Luke for so long but you never felt this way around him before. \n\n \"Not bad for two guys who can't dance,\" Luke chuckles. \"If you think about it, we weren't a disaster waiting to happen.\"\n\n \"We r-really weren't,\" you stumble over your words a little. \n\n You step apart as the song ends, and you feel breathless. Not from the dancing, but from the comforting experience of it all. The two of you exchange a brief but meaningful look before Luke gives you a friendly clap on the shoulder. The two of you walk off the dance floor, feeling very different than when you first stepped on it together. And although you hate to admit it, you wouldn't have minded having Luke's hands on your shoulders a little longer.\n\n \n \n \n \n As the song plays, you exchange a brief glance with Luke. Something familiar sparks, a sense of competition flickering between the two of you.\n\n \"You're not going to let me show you up here, are you?\" Luke asks, a hint of a challenge in his voice.\n\n \"Only if you can keep up,\" you reply.\n\n Without missing a beat, Luke takes your hand, and you both step up your game. You begin mirroring each other's moves, each trying to outdo the other. Luke spins you around, but instead of stumbling, you spin right back.\n\n \"Damn, not bad,\" Luke says. \"But watch this.\"\n\n Luke throws in an exaggerated twirl, pulling you back with a wide grin. You respond with your own quick footwork, stepping up the tempo. The two of you move in sync, but there's a clear edge of competition in each step and move, as both of you are unwilling to back down. \n\n \"Go, [name]!\" Samantha cheers for you. \"Don't let Luke win.\"\n\n You shoot her a quick smirk before refocusing on Luke. You playfully push him, nudging his shoulder lightly. Your laughter fills the air as you try to one-up him, and it's clear you're both having a blast. As the song reaches its climax, Luke pulls off a smooth move, dipping you unexpectedly. You're surprised, but unwilling to lose. You quickly recover, pushing yourself back up and spinning away in a flourish.\n\n \"Not bad, [name],\" Luke chuckles. \n\n \"Come on, I clearly won that,\" you quip back.\n\n You both share a light-hearted laugh, feeling tired but exhilarated from the competition. The two of you exit the dance floor, and although neither of you will admit it, it is a tie.\n\n \n \n \n As the music plays and you sway awkwardly with Luke, an unexpected wave of self-consciousness washes over you. You become acutely aware of everything—the curious glances from your peers, the slight stiffness in Luke's movements, and the fact that you're a guy dancing with another guy. You can't shake the feeling that people are watching. Your thoughts begin to race, filled with uncertainty and doubt. \n\n \"Hey, are you good?\" Luke asks, concerned after noticing the change in your body language.\n\n \"Yeah, but it just feels kind of weird, doesn't it?\" you try to force a chuckle but can't.\n\n \"Not at all,\" Luke raises his eyebrows. \"It's just a dance, who cares what other people think.\"\n\n You appreciate the nonchalance he has, but it doesn't stop your heart from pounding. You try to focus on the music, but the sensation of being out of place lingers. You notice how stiffly you're moving compared to some of the other pairs. There's no fluidity to your steps, no rhythm in your movements. \n\n \"I don't know,\" you say, your voice trailing off.\n\n \"We can just step this one out if you're not feeling it,\" Luke says, gently putting a hand on your shoulder. The two of you make your way off the dance floor early, a bit of awkwardness lingering.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

There's a beat before you take her hand, and you make your way onto the dance floor. The slow rhythm of the music sets the tone as you face each other.

      "text": "You take a deep breath, feeling the pulse of the music in the gym. You turn to Samantha, who's watching you with an expectant grin and a subtle challenge in her eyes. Samantha's always teased you about your hesitance and lack of confidence, but you decide to surprise her tonight.\n\n \"Alright, let's see if you can keep up,\" you say.\n\n \"Oh?\" Samantha asks, her eyebrows shooting up. \"Mr. Yoon finally has some moves?\"\n\n Without another word, you hold out your hand. Samantha grasps it, her soft hand clasped in yours. You lead her onto the dance floor, gently pulling her close as the two of you find your rhythm. You guide the movements, making Samantha grin. \n\n \"Look at you, all in control.\"\n\n You spin her with a flourish, your steps steady. You're surprised by yourself, you're not normally the type to take charge, especially on the dance floor. But something about this moment just feels right, like you have a perfect opportunity. Your nerves settle and you lean into the flow of the music, allowing your body to move naturally. You know you're in control, and there's a sense of fluidity in how you're leading.\n\n \"Hmm, maybe I've been holding back too much,\" you chuckle.\n\n \"Maybe you have!\" Samantha laughs, clearly impressed. \"Where's all this confidence coming from?\"\n\n Your bodies briefly brush as you dance, and your heart races. Not from nerves, but from the excitement of the moment. Right now, you're just having fun and enjoying the moment with Samantha. As the song reaches its final notes, you dip Samantha, causing her to giggle in delight. You hold the position for a second before she pushes herself back upright, and you can see just a hint of rose on her cheeks. For a few minutes, this dance made you feel like you were in your own little world.\n\n \"You seriously pulled that off, huh?\" Samantha asks.\n\n \"Maybe you've been underestimating me,\" you reply. \n\n The two of you make your way off the dance floor, but despite the crowd around you, you don't see anybody other than Samantha.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The music pulses softly, and as everyone begins to settle into pairs, Samantha flashes a grin at you.\n\n \"How about I lead this time?\" she asks.\n\n \"You know what, sure,\" you reply. You're not confident about your own dancing skills in the slightest, and Samantha's leading would take some of the pressure off you. \"You're probably better at this anyway.\"\n\n Samantha steps in closer, taking charge with supreme confidence. She places her hand firmly on your waist and leads you into the rhythm of the song. Her movements are smooth and assertive, guiding you with a gentle tug here and a subtle nudge there. You stumble slightly at first, but Samantha keeps you steady. As she moves with you across the floor, gliding through the dance, she spins you around lightly. You can't help but laugh at how strange it feels to be led like this, but there's a strange and oddly enjoyable sensation in giving up control.\n\n \"I'm amazing, no?\" Samantha winks, and you can feel a little bit of tension leave your body. You remind yourself that Samantha is your best friend, and seeing her be her usual playful self helps you relax. \n\n \"You are amazing, Samantha,\" you laugh.\n\n As the dance progresses, Samantha continues to guide you through the music, occasionally adding a fancy move. You notice some of your peers around you, but you can't be bothered to care what they think. You're too focused on keeping up with Samantha's pace and enjoying the moment. Suddenly, Samantha pulls you closer, her voice dropping to a serious tone for just a second.\n\n \"You're doing really well, [name],\" she says. \"Sometimes, you just have to let go of everything and live in the moment.\"\n\n You nod, unable to say anything. Her message resonates with you though, and you realize letting go isn't a bad thing. Maybe, just maybe, with everything going on, it would be okay to let someone else take control for a change. The music slows as the song nears its end, and Samantha is clearly pleased with the performance the two of you put on.\n\n \"Samantha, that was amazing,\" you say, exhilarated by the dance you shared with her.\n\n \"Sounds like a win to me,\" Samantha says. The both of you stand there for a moment, both a little breathless from the fun of it all. You realize that despite your initial hesitation, you feel lighter. As the two of you head off the dance floor, there's a sense of ease in your body that wasn't there before.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As the song takes on a softer, slower rhythm, you lock eyes with Samantha. There's a playful gleam in her gaze, the one she always has, but this time you feel something more intimate buried deep inside. You hesitate for just a moment, but the music, the way she smiles, and her green eyes urge you to step a little closer. You tighten your hold on her hand and draw her in, feeling the warmth of her body as you bridge the space between you and her. Samantha doesn't pull away though, instead letting out an amused breath. She wraps her free arm around your shoulder, resting her hand comfortably.\n\n \"Getting bold, huh?\" she giggles. \n\n \"Who knows, maybe I am getting bold,\" you reply.\n\n The tension in your shoulders slowly eases as you settle into the rhythm of the music. The close proximity between you two makes the dance feel more intimate, and you feel hyperaware of everything. The brush of her arm, the way your hands stay linked, and the way her dark hair falls softly against your cheek. Samantha's expression softens as you move, the teasing tone she always has fading into something more sincere.\n\n \"You're not bad at this, [name],\" she whispers. \"Maybe you've got more rhythm than you let on.\"\n\n You feel your cheeks flush slightly, caught off guard by the compliment. Not quite knowing how to respond, you give her a small smile.\n\n \"Maybe I've been holding out on you.\"\n\n You fall into a comfortable silence, the music and your gaze saying everything that needs to be said. You feel the closeness in every step, and it's different from how the two of you usually interact. Not in a bad way though. You let your thoughts drift, wondering how things might be changing between the two of you. There's something unspoken in the air, a quiet tension buzzing.\n\n \"This is kind of nice, don't you think?\"\n\n \"Yeah, it is.\"\n\n The two of you continue dancing, moving a little slower now, more in tune with each other. It's not as playful as before, but there's a sense of comfort in the closeness. As the song winds down, Samantha looks up at you with a small, knowing smile. When the music finally stops, she pulls back just slightly, but her hand lingers on your shoulder for a moment before she finally lets go. She doesn't say anything out loud, but you can sense there are unspoken words. The two of you leave the dance floor, feeling very different.\n\n \n As the music sways through the gym, you feel a mix of excitement and nerves. Dancing with Samantha feels comfortable in some ways but it is definitely unfamiliar. You know Samantha well enough to know she'd probably lead the two of you into something wild or playful if you let her, but you just want to keep things simple tonight. You fall into step with the beat, and you choose not to take the lead or do anything bold. You just let the moment flow, keeping the dance easy and light.\n\n \"Aww, come on, [name],\" Samantha says with a playful smile on her face. \"I know you can do better than this.\"\n\n \"What, are you saying my moves aren't good enough for you?\" you reply.\n\n \"I'm saying you've got potential that you're holding back on,\" she teases.\n\n The two of you continue bantering, the lighthearted teasing making the dance feel like just another fun moment between friends. Samantha occasionally adds some small flourish to her movements, but you keep things simple. You're just going to enjoy the moment without pushing it. The both of you laugh, the conversation flowing easily as you sway side by side. The comfortable rhythm helps you forget about the crowd, and for a few minutes, it's just the two of you. Best friends enjoying each other's company. As you make your way off the dance floor with her, you're glad that Samantha is your best friend.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

I know I haven't been around as much as I should have, but I'd love to hear more about it. Maybe we can grab something to eat and spend some time together, just the two of us.\"\n\n Your dad's tone softens considerably, and it's clear he's genuinely making an effort to connect. This feels new to you, as until now, it seemed he was just going through the motions of being a father. You appreciate the attention, but another part of you feels a little unsure.\n\n \"Wow, you're actually doing something exciting,\" Lily leans over her plate with a grin. \"The mall and a school club, it's all so exciting. Who knows, maybe you'll become a social butterfly.\"\n\n \"Yeah, don't expect anything,\" you roll your eyes. \"Sorry that I'm not the super popular older brother that you wanted.\"\n\n \"Listen, I know things have been different this year,\" your dad steps back in. \"I just want to let you know I'm here if you ever want to talk about anything.

The reply is almost automatic, the kind of response you've given so many times in the past. \n\n \"Same old, huh?\" your dad frowns, a flicker of hurt in his eyes. It's clear he's disappointed by your response, but he does his best not to let it show too much. \"I guess that's not necessarily a bad thing. At least you're not dealing with any drama, huh?\"\n\n Silence fills the room as you remain focused on your breakfast, not giving much away. Your dad chuckles lightly, in his best attempt to lighten the mood, but it's clear the conversation has run out of steam already.\n\n <<if [feminineLooks] > 9>> \n \"I don't know about things being the same old for you, [name],\" Lily interjects, filling the tense silence. \"You never used to care about how you look, but you've been different lately.

Your dad's attempt at giving you attention ends there, and you wonder if you should've said anything differently.\n\n \n \n \"Well, anything I say wouldn't be nearly as interesting as hearing about Lily's interesting life,\" you say with a sly grin, turning the spotlight toward your younger sister. It's a move you've mastered over the years, as it allows you to not talk about yourself while getting to tease Lily. You know she loves the attention anyway.\n\n \"Come on, my life is so interesting compared to you, [name],\" Lily perks up. \"I can't believe nobody is interested in my amazing life.\"\n\n \"Well, Lily's always got something going on,\" your dad says. \"But I'm curious about how things are going for you, [name]. I know school can be a lot to handle sometimes, and I'm always here if you need to chat.\"\n\n An awkward silence fills the room as you don't respond to your dad. You just continue poking at your breakfast.\n\n \"Well, since everyone's so curious, I'm doing fantastic, as usual,\" Lily boasts, giving you yet another opportunity to deflect the spotlight to Lily. The conversation shifts away from you, although your dad gives you a lingering stare of disappointment.\n\n \n \n \"I don't really want to talk about it,\" you say, feeling a pang of frustration. The stress from the curse looming in the background, the pressure from the changes you've been experiencing, and the irritation from your dad's attempt to dig into your life all make your temper short. You turn back to your breakfast, intentionally focusing on cutting your toast.\n\n \"Oh...\" your dad says, taken aback. His face is a mix of surprise and disappointment, and he looks away from you while shifting uncomfortably. \"Alright then.\"\n\n \"You know, [name]'s always been a little independent,\" your mom steps in, picking up on the tension. \"I think he just needs a little breathing room.\"\n\n After some more awkward silence passes, conversation resumes, although your dad is clearly trying to respect your space now. You're just glad you don't have to deal with it for now.\n \n\n[Choice: Finish up breakfast]",

The air is thick with incense, a heady mix of spice and something sweet—like crushed roses steeped in honey. It clings to your skin and sinks into your lungs, making the world outside feel distant.\n\nAnd then there's her.\n\nShe reclines behind the table draped in silk and gold that shimmer brighter than the stars. Deep purple fabric flows over her curves, clinging in places where they shouldn't. A golden chain rests against the bare expanse of her collarbone, dipping low. It draws attention to her chest, barely contained by the bejeweled top she has on. Every gentle breath she takes makes the delicate chains adorning her body shift ever so slightly, catching the light and demanding you look.\n\nBut it's her eyes that snare you completely, violet, darkened by kohl, and framed by thick lashes. She watches you like she already knows why you're here. Like she already has the answer to the question you haven't even asked.\n\n\"Sit, [name],\" she purrs, her voice smooth as silk with the faintest trace of amusement curling at the edges.

She taps lightly against the aged parchment. \"Magic is not meant to be faced in isolation. Let us see how your path has unfolded since we last met.\"\n\nThe candle on the table flickers, its flame dancing in her eyes. The tent seems to shrink around you, the outside world disappearing.\n\nShe studies you in silence, and for a second, all you can hear is the faint rustle of her silk garments as she shifts, the whisper of gold against skin. Her gaze drags over you like she's savoring something.\n\nThen she leans forward, just slightly, and the scent of her—exotic, warm, rich like spiced wine—fills your senses.\n\n\"Tell me, how do you feel?\" Madame Serena asks.\n\nThe question lingers as your pulse quickens.\n\n\"You carry much within you, child,\" she continues, tilting her head, her gaze piercing. A strand of dark hair slips over her shoulder, brushing against the soft swell of her breast. \"I see fear, but also curiosity. Conflict, but also desire.\"\n\nYour fingers tighten against your lap.\n\n\"This is why you have returned, isn't it?\" she whispers. \"To understand what you are becoming.\"\n\nThe air is thick between you.\n\n\"Let us see where this journey has led you, [name].\"\n\nAs her gaze gleams with something unreadable, you realize: there's no hiding from the truth.

Everything had been so immediate and overwhelming, and all you could do was focus on the now. But at this moment, with the changes feeling less like a curse and more like a guide, you could feel the inklings of something stirring.\n\n \"I don't know, but I think I'm ready to figure it out.\"\n\n \"Trust in yourself, in the magic, and in what's to come.

Look at the way the world has started to see you. Do you truly believe this is all the magic is doing? Or could it be that it's revealing something that was always there, just hidden away?\"\n\n \"I know who I am, lady,\" you snap, your jaw tightening. \"This isn't it.\"\n \n Madame Serena sighs, shaking her head from side to side.\n\n \"I didn't choose this,\" you say, your stomach churning. \"I just want to feel normal again. Like myself.\"\n\n \n \n Madame Serena's eyes sweep over you, her all-knowing smile flickering for a second. There was something about you that didn't align with her expectations. \"This is... unusual,\" she murmurs, almost to herself. \"The magic should resonate, should align with something deep within you. It shouldn't feel so foreign.\"\n\n \"Guess your magic is wrong,\" you say, your tone cutting.\n\n \"Sometimes, transformation magic doesn't just reflect who we are. It challenges us to confront what we fear, deny, or bury. You don't have to embrace the change, [name], but you do need to face it. Only then will the magic reveal its true purpose. I saw something in you, [name]. It may not feel right at the moment, but it isn't without meaning.\"\n \n \n \n \"Denial is a heavy burden to carry,\" she says. \"I understand that it weighs down the spirit and blinds the mind.

They all hint at someone who had embraced the changes within.\n\n \"[name],\" Madame Serena says, her voice rich with intrigue. \"You've come far, haven't you?\"\n\n You smile slightly, a light blush creeping up your cheeks. \"I guess you could say that,\" you say. \"I'm figuring stuff out.\"\n\n \"Figuring things out is the heart of transformation. Tell me, how has it felt? Your energy has shifted considerably. Your spirit is softer, more open.\"\n\n You nod slowly, resting your elbows on your knees as you think about how to respond to her question. \"It's weird,\" you finally say. \"I thought that this curse was about physically turning me into a girl. But funnily enough, it's been the small things. The way I talk to people, how I see the world. I don't hate it, honestly.\"\n\n \"You've embraced the changes within, even if you resist the surface,\" Madame Serena leans forward and studies you with interest. \"That's rare, [name]. Most people focus on what they see rather than what they feel.\"\n\n \"I suppose I'm the exception,\" you chuckle. \"It's not like I'm avoiding the physical stuff on purpose, I'm just going with my own pace.\"\n\n \"The magic is respecting your boundaries. It's sensing that you've embraced enough to grow without forcing more upon you.\"\n\n You frown slightly, considering her words. \"So, what happens now? Do I stay in this in-between state?\"\n\n \"Only you can decide,\" the seer replies, her tone gentle but firm. \"The spell is not static. It will respond to your choices, your willingness to explore. If you feel comfortable as you are, it could pause. But should you choose to delve deeper, it will answer. Remember the magic isn't here to define you—it's here to reveal you.\"\n\n \n \n \n Serena Evaluation 4 Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n Madame Serena's expression shifts subtly as her gaze sweeps over you. Your features remained mostly unchanged and your demeanor hasn't changed either. \"I'll admit, you've surprised me,\" she says, her voice softer than usual.\n\n \"Yeah, well, I don't know what you expected,\" you say, frowning. \"This curse hasn't done much except make my life more complicated.\"\n\n The seer blinks, momentarily at a loss for words.\n\n \"Complicated?\" she asks. \"You haven't changed?\"\n\n \"Not really,\" you shake your head. \"There have been moments, but I'm keeping it together. Whatever this thing is, I'm not letting it take over.\"\n\n \"The spell should've begun reshaping you by now,\" Madame Serena studies you closely, as though searching for some hidden clue. \"If you're still resisting this strongly, the magic should be pushing back. But it looks like it hasn't touched you much at all.\"\n\n \"You're the one who cursed me, shouldn't you know what's going on?\"\n\n \"The magic is meant to work in harmony with the person it touches,\" the seer says, a confused expression on her face. \"You're holding the spell at bay, somehow. Not just physically or mentally, but entirely.\"\n\n \"Maybe that's because I don't want this,\" you snap, your voice rising. \"I never asked for this. Never. I already know who I am.\"\n\n \"For now, it seems the spell is content to lie dormant,\" Madame Serena says, letting out a weary sigh. \"Whether you embrace it or resist, the magic will remain a part of you.\"\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "\"About breaking this curse though, how would I do that?\" you ask quietly. \n\n\"The curse isn't indefinite,\" Madame Serena's eyes bore into you. Her gaze was steady, almost solemn. \"By the time you graduate high school—by the end of your senior year—it will solidify. Whatever changes you've undergone, whether you've embraced them or fought them, will become permanent.\"\n\n\"Permanent?\" you whisper.\n\n\"The magic works within a timeline,\" the seer says, her tone unyielding. \"It adapts, it shifts, it waits—but only for so long. If you haven't found a way to break the curse by then, you will remain as you are.\"\n\n\"You're telling me I have a deadline to figure this all out then?\" you ask, a chill running down your spine.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Madame Serena nods. \"Breaking the curse will require understanding its purpose and making peace with what it's shown you. You'll have to confront it, [name], one way or another.\"\n\nYour mind races as you realize every choice you make, every moment of resistance or acceptance, every transformation you'll undergo—it all seems to hold much more weight.\n\n\"Why are you telling me this now?\" you ask, almost wary. \n\n\"Because you deserve to know the stakes. Deep down, I believe you can face this.\"\n\n\"Can't you just break the curse for me?\" you \n \n<<if [acceptance] > 14>> \n ask.\n\n \n plead.\n \n \n\"You're the one who put this curse on me in the first place. You started this entire thing!\"\n\nMadame Serena shakes her head. \"You think it's that simple, don't you?\" Madame Serena says with a sigh. \"Magic doesn't work like flicking a light switch, child. The spell I placed wasn't random, nor was it a punishment. It's woven into you now, like threads in a tapestry. Pulling at a string would unravel far more than just the curse.\"\n\n\"So I have to deal with this curse until the end of the year?\" you ask.\n\n\"Think of it this way, [name],\" Madame Serena begins. \"The curse isn't something to be erased. It's a reflection of your actions, your choices, your truths. Breaking it is about understanding why it happened and deciding what you're going to do with that knowledge. The magic is a mirror, young one. And mirrors don't lie, do they? It's showing you something about yourself. Whether you embrace it, reject it, or find a way to balance it, that's entirely up to you. But you are the key to breaking this curse, not me.\"\n\n\"Okay then,\" you whisper, not quite knowing what more to say. You turn to leave, lingering near the exit. Your hand rests on the edge of the curtain as you think.\n\n\"One last thing, [name],\" the seer calls out to you. \n \n \n \"It seems you've already gained more control over the spell.\"\n\n \"Oh, you could sense that?\" you ask. \"I talked to this girl at my school, she gave me more control over the curse.\"\n\n \"Yes, I'm well aware of Aurora,\" Madame Serena says, a faint smile on her face. \"I believe you don't need more control over the curse for now.\"\n\n \n \n <<if [femineChanges] > 5>> \n \"You have transformed quite a few times, I'll grant you more control over the spell.\"\n \n \n \"You haven't transformed much yet, but I'll grant you more control over the spell.\"\n \n\n \"More control?\" you ask, confused.\n\n \"Oh, nothing,\" Madame Serena says, a faint smile on her face. \"You'll know soon.\"\n \n\n[Choice: Go back home]",

      "text": "You lie in your bed, staring at the ceiling as the dim glow of the desk lamp cast soft shadows across your room. Madame Serena's words echo in your mind like a constant loop. You think about one quote in particular that stands out to you.\n\n \n \"Embrace it fully, and you'll find the world will begin to reflect a new kind of light.\"\n\n Her words linger, almost like a challenge. You thought about how your body had changed so much already. Your reflection in the mirror no longer matching the boy you used to know. Your face was softer now, more delicate. It was all undeniable. Madame Serena hadn't told you to fight it or hide it, instead she spoke of embracing it.\n\n You pull the covers closer, as if shielding yourself from the weight of your own thoughts. It felt like the world was shifting around you, like the curse was pushing you to become someone else. You didn't feel lost though, or like you didn't want the changes. If anything, you liked the changes. \n\n Looking back on your journey, you realize something had changed deep inside of you. There was fear, yes. But there was also an undeniable curiosity. You've been leaning into the transformations, accepting it. Should you continue embracing it? What more could it reveal about yourself? Were you perhaps not the normal guy you always thought you were?\n\n Maybe it wasn't about the fear of losing who you were, but the possibility of becoming someone even better.\n\n \n \"You wear the changes well, even if you refuse to let them settle into your heart.\"\n\n The words echo in your head, lingering like an unanswered question. Your reflection in the mirror was becoming harder to ignore with each passing day. Your face was still familiar, but noticeably softer. They'd taken on a gentler contour. \n\n Despite all that though, you just couldn't bring yourself to accept it. You didn't want to. Not when everything you had ever known, everything that had ever defined you, was now being shaken apart. The curse was there, but so was your refusal to let it take over. You were still [name], the boy you'd always been. The boy who just lived a normal life without the need to change. You couldn't be someone else, not just like that.\n\n You pull the blanket up closer to your chin. Was the curse not just about physical change? Could it be about accepting something deeper within you that you never even considered?\n\n You weren't ready for that though. Not yet, at least. You couldn't just let go of everything you believe in. Your heart, the sense of who you are, was still firmly rooted in the person you'd always been.\n\n For now, at least, that was enough.\n\n \n \"Remember the magic isn't here to define you—it's here to reveal you.\"\n\n Her words hang in the air, warm and heavy, as if they were meant to unlock something inside you. The thought of it gnaws at you, something about it feeling true. You hadn't changed much physically, your body still holding the sharp angles of your old self. There was a quiet femininity in you, but it wasn't enough to make you feel like someone else. Not entirely, anyway.\n\n Still, there was a sense that your transformation was different. It wasn't about becoming something unrecognizable; it was more like peeling back layers to reveal something that had always been there but was buried beneath the surface. The more you thought about it, the more that idea started to make sense.\n\n You turn onto your side, your graze drifting to the window. Moonlight casts faint shadows on your walls, and think about how you were horrified by the curse. Fighting against them was the knee-jerk reaction to protect the parts of you that felt safe and familiar. But maybe, just maybe, that wasn't the right approach. Maybe it was time to stop fighting it.\n\n \n \"Whether you embrace it or resist, the magic will remain a part of you.\"\n\n A part of you bristle at her words. Why should you have to deal with this? You didn't ask for this. You didn't want it. Everything about the curse felt wrong—like they didn't belong to you. You let out a frustrated sigh. You knew who you were, a regular guy trying to figure out his life. \n\n But now, everything felt off. It was like your reflection in the mirror shifted without your permission. No matter how much you rejected it, how much you fought to stay the same, the curse would linger. It wasn't something you could shake off, the curse was a part of you now. You didn't know what that meant, and that gnawed at you.\n\n As you stare out the window, the moonlight casting faint shadows on your walls, you make a silent promise to yourself. You would resist, fight, do whatever it would take to hold onto who you are. You just hoped that would be enough.\n \n\n[Choice: Drift off to sleep]",

Trees rise around you like towering figures, their trunks thick and gnarled and branches obscuring the sky. The forest feels vast, its silence broken only by the soft rustling of leaves in a gentle breeze. You take a deep breath, the coolness of the air filling your lungs. The weight of the world feels distant for just a moment. Here, it's as if time has stopped entirely.\n\nAs you venture deeper, the path beneath your feet becomes less clear, obscured by the mist that clings to the ground. Fog swirls around you, creating a sense of isolation. There's an odd comfort in the quiet as if this place exists solely for you to explore your feelings. You hear the distant sound of a voice, soft and melodic, drifting through the air.\n\n\"Come closer,\" the voice beckons gently, like a whisper in the wind. Your heart quickens, and although you can't place where the voice is coming from, the pull to follow it is undeniable. You continue walking, the fog thinning as you move, and the air grows warmer. \n\nThe path before you opens up into a small clearing, bathed in moonlight. There, standing in the center of the clearing is a figure. Her silhouette glows with an ethereal light, contrasting against the shadows of the forest. As you approach, the figure's features become clearer. You're finally able to make out what she looks like when—\n\nYou freeze.\n\nThe girl before you is not a stranger. She's a reflection of yourself, only in a form far more feminine than you've ever seen. Her face mirrors your own, but softer—more delicate. Her dark hair cascades down her back, shimmering like a river of starlight. She wears a flowing white dress made of some silken fabric that seems to dance with the breeze. She looks powerful, like a being that truly belongs to this otherworldly place. You feel a strange connection to her as if you've always known her. She steps toward you slowly, her movements graceful and fluid.\n\n\"[name],\" she says, her voice soft, like the sound of a breeze through the trees. She extends her hand toward you, her palm open. You can sense she's offering something. An invitation. A chance to step forward into something unknown. \"I've been waiting for you.\"\n\nHer eyes never leave yours as she waits for you to respond. The weight of your decision hangs in the air like a heavy fog. Your heart races and everything seems to fade away except for the girl in front of you.

As you reach out to take her hand, the world around you seems to hold its breath. The moment your palms meet, a spark of energy courses through you. It's electric as if you've tapped into a force far greater than yourself.\n\n The girl's smile deepens, her gaze steady and filled with warmth. \"You've made the right choice,\" she says softly, her voice carrying a tone of reassurance that seems to echo through the entire forest. The gentle, soothing heat from her hands moves up your arms and through your chest. It's not just physical; it's emotional—a sense of belonging and clarity wash over you.\n\n The fog around the two of you seems to lift, thinning and swirling around to reveal a forest that's transformed. The trees are no longer foreboding and dark. Instead, their branches are adorned with soft cherry blossoms that glow faintly in the moonlight. The ground beneath your feet feels alive, dotted with luminescent flowers.\n\n As the girl gently guides you further into the clearing, her dress trailing behind her like liquid light, you can't help but smile. \"You've always had this within you,\" the girl says, noticing your reaction. \"This is not a transformation, really. It's more like an unveiling. You're stepping into who you truly are.\"\n\n Tears prickle at the corners of your eyes.

It's a part of you now.\"\n\n She disappears, and the clearing brightens momentarily. The light cascades over you, filling you with a sense of peace. When the light fades, you find yourself lying in your bed, your heart still racing. The feeling of her hands lingers like a phantom touch.

I just want things to go back to the way they were.\"\n\n The girl sighs, and the light around her begins to dim. The forest responds, and the forest gets darker. Everything becomes cold, and the girl lowers her hand.\n\n \"I understand, [name],\" the girl says, her eyes welling with tears. \"I guess the choice is yours.\"\n\n The light around her dissipates into the shadows of the forest. You feel a chill settle over you as the forest grows empty. The girl disappears completely, and the forest around you begins to blur. The moss and the trees melt away into darkness.\n\n When you open your eyes, you're back in your bed. Your room is bathed in the faint glow of morning light filtering in through the window. You sit up slowly, the phantom sensation of the girl's presence lingering in your mind.

You try and twist it into place, but the tie snaps off your fingers. It flies away and lands on the floor.\n\n\"Oh my God,\" you groan, running a hand through your hair. \n\nYou slump back in your chair for a moment, sighing. But something inside you, some determination, won't let you quit. You start higher up on your head and comb through your hair with your fingers to keep it smooth. You gather the strands tightly, and after a few tries, you manage to loop the elastic band over the bundle once. Then, with a slow and careful twist, you do it again. \n\nFor a moment, you can't believe you just did that. Sure, it's just tying your hair, but it fills you with a strange sense of accomplishment. It was a small thing, but it was your small thing. You did it all by yourself. You stand up and take a look at yourself, turning your head from side to side. You feel \n \n \n a little nervous.\n\n \n a little excited.\n \n\nSitting back down, you let out a breath you hadn't realized you were holding. You did a pretty good job. For now, though, you have to decide what to do with your ponytail.\n\n[Choice: Keep your hair tied]\n[Choice: Keep your hair loose]",

The game's familiar theme music plays, and you realize it's been a very long time since you've played. \n\n A moment later, your avatar appears on the screen. The town is just as you left it: a collection of cozy homes, blooming flowerbeds, and a well-decorated town square. Weeds are growing, though, and your poor villagers all have a frown on their face. You can't help but feel a little bad that you neglected them for so long. \"Ah, sorry,\" you mutter to yourself, half-laughing as you guide your character toward some weeds. \n\n One of the villagers, a snooty flamingo named Ruby, waddles up to you with a pout. You click on her to chat and her dialogue bubble pops up.\n\n \"[name]! I thought you disappeared forever!\" the poor flamingo says. \"I was about to declare your house haunted. You owe me a snack for making me worry so much!\"\n\n You chuckle and gift Ruby a peach to make amends.\n\n Over the next hour, you find yourself entirely immersed in your own little world. You dig up fossils, fish in the river, and rearrange furniture. There's something soothing about organizing this tiny, perfect world when your real life is so chaotic.\n\n <<if [femininity] > 14>> \n As you work, you notice your own preferences subtly influencing the game. You choose softer colors for furniture and plant bright flowers around the town square. It's a far cry from the dark aesthetic you used to favor.\n \n \n As you work, you notice your preferences are the same as always. The dark, rugged aesthetic you always go for still looks nice, and you find yourself matching it the best you can.\n \n \n Before you can think too deeply about it, another villager interrupts your musings. This time, it's a smug cat named Maurice walking up to you with a thought bubble above his head. You click on him to see what he has to say.\n\n <<if [femininity] > 14>> \n \"You look different these days, kid,\" he says. \"A little softer around the edges. I guess I like it, though. Makes the place feel brighter.\"\n\n You freeze for a moment. The words hit a little too close to home.

Don't leave us again, if you can.\"\n\n You smile, feeling bad that you left these little critters alone for so long. You gift him an apple, and Maurice is very pleased. \n \n \n By the time you log off, the town is looking happy again.

The screen flashes with the game's gritty title sequence: an army of soldiers charging through a desolate battlefield. The heavy soundtrack kicks in, and you feel a familiar rush of adrenaline. This is what you need—something intense to drown out your thoughts.\n\n The game loads, and you see your avatar; an armored operative decked out in the most advanced tactical gear the military had to offer. You take a moment to tweak your loadout, adding a few new mods to your rifle and looking at the newly added weapons. Everything feels precise and controlled.\n\n You join a match, and within seconds, you're dropped into the Chaos of Urban Descent, one of the game's infamous maps.

You try and tell yourself that this is your game. You finish the game in third place though, and let out a loud sigh. Maybe, as much as you hate to admit it, you're starting to change in ways that even Need of Arms can't shield you from.\n \n \n You continue dominating, racking up kills and increasing your kill streak.

The hum of conversation and clatter of lockers fill the air as your peers mill around, changing into their gym kits and chatting. You make your way over to your locker, and see Vincent rummaging around the locker next to you. He glances up at you as you approach, a small grin spreading across his face.\n\n \n \"Hey, [name],\" Vincent says. \"Are you alright? Even I've heard a lot of rumors about you, and I'm usually out of the loop.\"\n \n \n \"Well, I've done all I could to calm the rumors,\" you respond, shrugging.\n \n \n \"Well, nothing I can do about it now,\" you respond, shrugging.\n \n \n \"Oh,\" Vincent says, trying to think of what to say. \"Well, we're friends, so let me know if you need to talk.\"\n\n \"Thank you,\" you can't help but smile, glad to have people supporting you. \"I appreciate it.\"\n\n <<if [breastsProg] > 1 and [bind] is false>> \n \"But, uhh, I'm doing my best to ignore the rumors, but,\" Vincent glances at your chest awkwardly. \"How do you have... those?\"\n\n \"It's complicated,\" you murmur.

You can't believe your nipples are this sensitive.\n \n \n \n You wince, the fabric binding your chest hurts you as it digs into your ribs. The dull ache in your chest was growing sharper, radiating with every breath. You shift uncomfortably, putting a hand under your armpit as you try and adjust the towel around your chest. \n\n \"Are you alright, [name]?\" Vincent's voice cuts through the ambient chatter of the locker room.\n\n \"I'm fine,\" you lie quickly.\n\n \"You look tense, I'm just worried,\" Vincent frowns, a look of concern on his face. \n \n \n Your breasts aren't noticeable enough that they affect you, but they are growing and make your chest sensitive. \n \n <<if [adultPref] > 0>> \n You shift your body, and your shirt twists in an awkward way. You have to hold back a moan as your shirt brushes against your nipples.\n\n \"What was that, [name]?\" Vincent asks, concern etched on his face.\n\n \"Oh, nothing,\" you say, turning bright red. It would embarrass you to no end to admit that you moaned a little.\n\n \"Oh, alright,\" Vincent murmurs. \"Just heard a weird sound from you.\"\n \n \n You shake your head and try to ignore it.\n \n \n \n You don't have any breasts yet, so it's not a concern in the slightest.

You hold up the top and athletic shorts and realize that you're going to have to change. You quickly glance at the restroom, where there are a few stalls where you could change in privacy. You could also stay and change in the locker room, although that could be awkward.\n\n \n \"Hey, [name],\" Vincent says. \"How are you doing today?\"\n\n \"I'm fine,\" you respond, shrugging. \"Just doing the same as always.\"\n\n \"Good to hear,\" Vincent smiles widely.\n\n You pull out your gym kit from your backpack and get ready to change.

You begin running, and everything is smooth sailing \n \n<<if [breastsProg] > 1>> \n \n until you realize just how uncomfortable the binding is. Walking around with the towel pressing down on your chest was bad enough, but running around the field had you on the verge of passing out. You're grabbing onto your ribs and your breaths come in short, shallow bursts. Each step sends a sharp twinge of pain radiating across your chest.\n\n \"[name], over here,\" Coach Blake's voice cuts through the haze of discomfort. \"Now!\"\n\n You wince but make your way to her, your legs heavy and chest heaving. \n\n \"Yes, coach?\" you murmur.\n\n \"What's going on?\" your coach asks, clearly concerned.\n\n \"Nothing, I'm just out of breath,\" you say, avoiding her gaze.\n\n Coach Blake raises her eyebrows, unconvinced by your terrible lie. She motions for you to follow her to the side of the gym, away from the other students.\n\n \"Don't lie to me, Yoon,\" Coach Blake says firmly. \"I've been a teacher long enough to know when someone's pushing through something they shouldn't be. What's going on with your chest?\"\n\n You freeze, your heart racing for another reason now. You hesitate, tugging the hem of your shirt as you try to think of a way to deflect.\n\n \"Look, I'm not here to judge,\" she says, softening her tone. \"But I can't help you if you don't tell me the truth, [name].\"\n\n \"I've got something wrapped around my chest,\" you whisper. \"To flatten it.\"\n\n \"Binding?\" your coach asks, a mix of concern and understanding crossing her face.\n\n You nod, unable to meet her eyes.\n\n Coach Blake sighs, resting her hands on her hips. \"I understand why you might feel like you need to do that, but running laps when bound? It's dangerous. You could seriously hurt yourself.\"\n\n \"I don't know what else to do,\" you mumble, your face burning with shame.\n\n \"First, we need to get you out of this,\" she begins. \"Go to the locker room, loosen whatever you have around your chest, and take a breather. Second, if this is something you're going to keep doing, you need the right gear. Wrapping yourself up with fabric is dangerous. I'll help you figure out how to get something safer. There are options.\"\n\n You look up at her, surprised. \"You'd help me?\"\n\n \"Of course,\" the coach gives you a small, reassuring smile. \"My job is to help you succeed, and that means making sure you're healthy.\"\n\n \"Thanks, Coach Blake,\" you say, feeling relieved. \n\n \"Go on now,\" she says, waving you off. \"Take care of yourself.\"\n\n You jog off to the locker room, still aching but grateful that Coach Blake was so accepting.\n\n [Choice: Catch your breath]\n \n \n until you realize just how uncomfortable your breasts are. The sensation of your chest moving uncomfortably with every step is impossible to ignore. Without any kind of support, your breasts feel awkward and heavy. You tug your shirt, trying to make it sit better against your body, but the fabric clung to you from the sweat.\n\n \"[name], over here,\" Coach Blake's voice cuts through the haze of discomfort. \"Now!\"\n\n You hesitate, but know there's no avoiding it. You jog over to her, your face burning with embarrassment.\n\n \"What's going on?\" your coach asks, clearly concerned.\n\n \"Nothing, I'm just out of breath,\" you say, avoiding her gaze.\n\n Coach Blake raises her eyebrows, unconvinced by your terrible lie. She motions for you to follow her to the side of the gym, away from the other students.\n\n \"Don't lie to me, Yoon,\" Coach Blake says firmly. \"I've been a teacher long enough to know when someone's uncomfortable. You're stiff, out of rhythm, and you're holding your chest like you're in pain. Are you alright?\"\n\n \"They're just sore,\" you whisper, your hands fidgeting with the hem of your shirt. \"When I run, I mean.\"\n\n Coach Blake blinks, processing your words. Her expression softens immediately as she nods. \"Got it,\" she says, her voice calm and understanding. \"You need some support.\"\n\n \"Support?\" you ask, your head snapping up.\n\n \"Yes, support,\" she says, gesturing vaguely to her own chest. \"It's nothing to be ashamed of. It happens to plenty of athletes, especially if things are new for you. A good sports bra makes a world of difference. You'd feel way more comfortable running.\"\n\n Your face turns bright red as you realize what she just said. \"A bra?\" you repeat.\n\n \"It's just about practicality,\" Coach Blake says with a small smile. \"I know it's not something you're used to, but trust me, it's better than being miserable out here.\"\n\n \"I wouldn't even know where to start,\" you admit.\n\n \"Well, I can help,\" your coach says, her tone becoming reassuring. \"We can figure out something that works for you. Something simple, no frills whatsoever. Just what you need to move comfortably. Don't worry, it doesn't need to be a big deal.\"\n\n \"You'd really help me with this?\" you ask, glancing at her. You're unsure about the bra, but you're grateful for her lack of judgment.\n\n \"Of course,\" she says. \"My job is to make sure you can train safely and confidently. That's what I'm here for. Alright, no more laps for now. Go to the locker room and take a breather, I'll be there soon.\"\n\n \"Thanks, Coach Blake,\" you say, feeling relieved. \n\n \"Go on now,\" she says, waving you off. \"Take care of yourself.\"\n\n You jog off to the locker room, grateful that Coach Blake was so accepting.\n\n [Choice: Catch your breath]\n \n<<elseif [hairProg] > 1 and [hairStyle] is 0>> \n until the school's air conditioning keeps blowing strands of hair into your face. You huff in frustration, brushing it aside, but it's no use. Every few steps, it's there again—sticking to your forehead, whipping against your cheeks, and even getting caught in your mouth once or twice.\n\n \"[name], over here,\" Coach Blake's voice cut through the air. \"Now!\"\n\n You make your way over to her, relieved that your hair isn't getting in your face.\n\n \"You know, [name],\" Coach Blake calls out. \"You've been fighting your hair more than the laps.\"\n\n You glance at her sheepishly, wiping some sweat from your brow. \"It's just long. I haven't figured out what to do with it yet.\"\n\n \"I can see that,\" she says with a small smile. She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a simple hair tie, holding it out to you. \"Here. Tie it back.\"\n\n \n \"I've never really done that before,\" you say, hesitating as you stare at the hair tie in her hand.\n\n \"Never?\" she asks, raising an eyebrow. \"Alright, no problem. Come here—I'll show you how.\"\n \n \n \"I'm a little unsure, I've only done it a few times,\" you say, hesitating as you stare at the hair tie in her hand.\n\n \"You really should practice,\" she says. \"I'll do it for you today, but if you have long hair, tying it back should be like instinct.\" \n \n\n She gestures for you to turn around, and you oblige.\n\n \"All you have to do is pull your hair back like this,\" she explains, sweeping it into a loose bundle at the back of your head. \"Then you twist the hair tie around it, like so. It doesn't need to be perfect, just enough to keep it out of your face.\"\n\n When she's done, you reach back and feel the neat ponytail she made. It's strange, but you have to admit, it's much better than the alternative of hair sticking to your skin.\n\n \"This is better,\" you say, glancing at her gratefully.\n\n \"Good,\" Coach Blake says, a smile on her face. \"You can keep the hair tie—it's a spare. But if you need help again, please don't be afraid to ask.\"\n\n You nod, feeling a little more confident. Sure, it's just a hair tie, but somehow it feels like a step toward making things more manageable.\n \n \n [Choice: Continue with P.E.]\n\n \n .

You hadn't considered the effects that your chest would have in gym class, which was a pretty stupid thing to overlook now that you thought about it. While deep in your thoughts, you heard Coach Blake's voice from the doorway.\n\n\"[name],\" she says. \n \n \n \n \n Coach Blake Binder Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n She holds a small, neatly folded black garment in her hand. \"I did a little digging after our talk and I found this. It's a binder—specifically made for chest compression. Safe compression.\"\n\n Your eyes widen as you stare at the binder. \"You found this for me?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" she says, an understanding smile on her face. \"I'm not an expert, but I know enough to see what you're doing right now isn't safe. Wrapping fabric around yourself like that can mess with your breathing, hurt your ribs, and cause a whole host of other problems.\"\n\n Your throat tightens and you want to shift your gaze.\n\n \"Look, I'm not here to pry into your personal life,\" Coach Blake says, sensing your discomfort. \"I don't need to know why, [name]. I just want to make sure you're safe. Okay?\"\n\n You nod slowly, your fingers brushing the edge of the binder. It felt very sturdy and wasn't bulky at all. \"Thank you,\" you murmur, the weight of her kindness almost overwhelming.\n\n \"Don't mention it,\" she says, standing back up. \"Just promise me you'll take care of yourself. No more improvised wrapping. Let me know if you have any questions, alright? We'll figure it out.\"\n\n \"Thank you,\" you whisper again. \"I appreciate it.\"\n\n As Coach Blake leaves the locker room, you unfold the binder in your hands. Simple and practical. It was exactly what you needed. You slip into a private part of the locker room and put it on, adjusting the binder until it sat snugly but not painfully. It feels strange, but after you move your arms and take a deep breath, you realize just how much better it was than what you were using.\n\n \n \n \n Coach Blake Bra Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n She holds a small, black garment in her hand that you instantly recognize as a bra. \"I did a little digging after our talk and I found this sports bra. It's brand new, don't worry. I'm sure you know what it does.\"\n\n You freeze, your face burning as you look at the bra.

This is going to help, trust me.\"\n\n \"Coach, I—\" you start speaking, but your voice catches.\n\n Coach Blake sits on the bench beside you, resting the sports bra between the two of you. She just lets it sit there, as if its presence speaks for itself.\n\n \"Look,\" she says, her voice softening. \"I'm not here to judge you, [name]. I don't know what's going on, and I don't need to know unless you want to tell me. But what I do know is that you can't keep running like this.\"\n \n\n \"You don't have to do this for anyone else,\" she continues. \"But you should do it for yourself. Running, jumping, even walking—it's all easier with the right support. Trust me, this doesn't have to mean anything other than keeping you comfortable.\"\n \n\n \"Okay,\" you say, reaching out hesitantly. You let your fingers brush the soft fabric of the sports bra. \"How do I...?\"\n\n \"Just slip it on over your head like a shirt, then adjust it so it fits snugly. Here, I'll wait outside while you try it on. Let me know if you need any help.\"\n\n \"Thank you,\" you say.\n\n \"Don't mention it,\" Coach Blake says, standing up. \"Just take care of yourself.\"\n\n She gives you a reassuring pat on the shoulder before walking out of the locker room.\n\n You sit there for a moment, the sports bra heavy in your hands, before finally slipping into a private part of the locker room to change. It takes a bit of fumbling, but once it's on, you notice the difference immediately. It feels weird, sure, but also relieving. \n \n\nAs you step out of the locker room, Coach Blake is waiting by the door. Her eyes sweep over you briefly, and she nods in approval.\n\n\"How does that feel?\" she ask.\n\n\"Better,\" you admit. \"A lot better.\"\n\n\"Good,\" she says. \"See how it feels today. If it works, let me know—I'll help you find more. And if it doesn't, we'll figure something else out. Deal?\"\n\n\"Deal,\" you say. \"Thank you so much, Coach Blake...\"\n\n\"Of course,\" your coach replies.\n\nThe thought of facing the rest of the school day doesn't feel so daunting anymore.\n\n[Choice: Continue with P.E.]",

Your finger traces a path across your flat tummy and you allow your hand to brush against the base of your penis. This was something you were very familiar with, having masturbated in this way many times over the years. Your breaths come in soft pants as you begin to tease yourself, gently grabbing your erect member. You wrap your hand around it and start stroking. You begin slowly, savoring how it feels. Closing your eyes, you let yourself fully immerse in your fantasy.\n \n \n On your back, you allow your hand to drift upward. Your nipples, already hard, peak further at the slightest contact. A whimper escapes your lips as you savor the euphoric sensation that comes from them. Your nipples react to your every touch, and their delicate sensitivity makes up for any inexperience.

Your hand traces a path down your flat tummy and you wrap it around your penis. You let your thumb trace lazy circles around the head while your other fingers tease the rest of it. Your other hand moves upward, toward your breasts. You let your fingers dance over your nipples and let out a whimper. The dual sensations make your body arch. You close your eyes and immerse yourself in your fantasy, falling into your thoughts.\n \n\n \n Your mind wanders to the thought of women as you pleasure yourself. You imagine that next to you is a woman—beautiful, confident, and utterly captivating. Her nimble fingers trace patterns on your arms and stomach, igniting sparks of pleasure that dance across your skin. Your breath catches in your throat as she leans closer. \n \n She opens her mouth and takes your penis in her mouth.

You imagine a man in front of you, a smirk on his face. He's strong, handsome, and completely infatuated with you. His gaze devours your form, appreciating every part of your body. His hands, large and capable, \n \n grab onto your penis. He gently strokes your penis \n \n \n cup your breasts. His thumb flicks your nipples \n \n \n grab onto both your penis and your left breast. He gently strokes your penis and teases your nipples \n \n as he leans down to capture your lips in a searing kiss. You moan, your hands desperately moving to mirror his touch.

It pauses to tease your balls, lightly tickling them. You bite your bottom lip, fighting back a moan as you increase the pace. \n \n \n You pinch and twist your nipples gently, eliciting a soft moan even though you try to hold it back. Your nipples are all you can focus on as you guide your fingers. Your fingers pinch and twist harder, and you have to bite your lip to avoid gasps of pleasure. Your movements become more urgent, your breasts rising and falling in time with your breaths. \n \n \n Your hips begin to rock gently, matching the rhythm of your hand. You stroke at your length as your nipples are subjected to increasingly firm pinches and tugs. Your breath comes in ragged gasps. Your hand moves faster on your cock, slick with precum, but your nipples remain the focal point of your pleasure. \n \n \n You're left writhing on your bed, your mind consumed by the sensations of your body.\n\n [Choice: You're at your limit]\n\n \n You let your hand move faster as you near an orgasm. Your entire body tenses and the room seems to fade away, as you can only focus on your pleasure. You can feel it building, coiling deep within you. Your toes curl, your hips buck, and your tongue lolls out of your mouth. A cry escapes your lips as you orgasm. Every cell in your being sings as you begin to reach the peak, a perfect storm of pleasure ripping through your body. You're left momentarily blinded, white flashes erupting across your vision. Three more quick flashes of pleasure appear before you finally reach the very peak of the mountain you've been climbing.\n\n Your entire body trembles, every muscle taut and quivering. Your hand moves even faster as you desperately try and keep the orgasm going for as long as you can. You can feel the familiar warm liquid erupt from your penis. Even as the last burst of pleasure subsides, you continue to tremble. You draw out the last vestiges of pleasure before finally collapsing on the bed, a boneless heap of goo.\n\n [Choice: Finish]",

Still, though, it felt a little weird that you imagined that. \n\n \n imagining a man jerking you off. Fantasizing about men felt different, but amazing. The thought of your partner being stronger and manlier than you fills you with a warm feeling. But what did this mean? \n\n \n imagining yourself as a woman. This was different from your usual fantasies. It was more intense, more personal. A mixture of confusion and fascination swirls within you as you contemplate what this means. You've always identified as male, and yet this fantasy awoke something within you that was difficult to ignore. \n \n \nYou shake your head and try and think of something else. \n\nYou look down at the thick layers of semen on your thighs and realize you're going to have to clean this all up. You get up, your legs wobbling, and grab some tissues from your desk. You wipe at the cum until it's all gone and head to the shower to get yourself cleaned up.\n\n[Choice: Clean yourself up]",

After scraping your trash into the bin, you make your way to the second floor for art. \n\nYou step into art class, looking forward to the lesson. It's a welcome distraction from everything happening around you, and it does give you a chance to explore your creativity. The familiar smell of paint, clay, and turpentine floats around in the air. At the front of the room is your teacher, Ms. Delgado. She has an apron on over a flowy blouse, and she greets each student as they enter the room.\n\n\"Good morning, [name],\" she says with a smile. \"Are you ready to show off your creative side today?\"\n\n\"Morning Ms. Delgado,\" you respond, nodding. \n\n\"Please, call me Sophia,\" Ms. Delgado says.\n\nYou take your usual seat in the \n<<if [confident] > [shy]>> \n front \n\n \n back \n \nof the room and soon the school bell rings.\n\n\"Okay, class,\" Ms. Delgado begins, clapping her hands together to get everyone's attention. \"We have a very special guest with us today.

      "text": "<<if [femininity] > 25>> \n \n The canvas feels daunting at first, its blank surface ready for a world of possibility. You close your eyes and think about the two parts of yourself—the person you were and the person you're becoming—and let the brush guide you.\n\n On one side of the canvas, you paint a figure shrouded in deep blues and grays. His posture is tense, shoulders drawn inward. His face is angular and shadowed, blending into the muted background. Around him, you draw sharp geometric shapes that jut out like armor.\n\n The other side of the canvas explodes with vibrant colors. You use pinks, yellows, and soft greens to draw another figure. She's radiant, standing tall with open arms and a serene expression. Her form has rounded edges and flowing lines, and she seems to almost glow.\n\n The two figures face each other, their gazes locked. At first glance, it feels like a confrontation. But as you add details, you notice it changing. You paint a delicate thread of gold connecting the two, stretching from one chest to the other. It's fragile and thin but unbroken.\n\n When you finish and step back, you realize the painting is about harmony. Both figures exist together, neither erasing the other. It feels like a step toward understanding yourself.\n \n \n \n The blank canvas stares back at you, and you're determined to make sense of the fractured pieces of yourself. You start with bold strokes of dark red and navy, forming the outline of a figure on the left side of the canvas.\n\n He's rigid and strong, standing with arms crossed and an unyielding expression. Around him, you paint jagged shapes—triangles and rectangles in dark tones.\n\n On the right side, you paint a second figure. This figure is unfinished, incomplete. Her form is softer and blurred at the edges. You use muted purples and silvers to color her, making her eyes wide with curiosity. She reaches out, her hand extending toward him, but they're hesitant. \n\n Between the two figures, you paint a swirling vortex of colors: greens, yellows, and oranges clashing and blending together. It's chaotic, representing the uncertainty and discomfort of trying to reconcile these two versions of yourself.\n\n When you finish and step back, you realize the painting doesn't offer any answers. The two figures stand apart, their differences starker than ever.\n \n\n \n \n \n <<if [femininity] > 25>> \n \n You stare at the blank canvas, your hand trembling as you pick up the brush. The world around you fades as you focus inward, channeling the whirlwind of emotions that have been building inside you for days now.\n\n The first stroke is a bold, sweeping curve. The deep crimson archest across the canvas like a ribbon, representing energy and vibrancy. From there, you add swirling patterns of lavender—a color you've found yourself gravitating toward lately. The softer tones twist and blend with the crimson, creating a sense of harmony amidst the chaos.\n\n At the center of the piece, you paint a glowing orb in soft pink and white, radiating light outward. It's a symbol of the transformation taking hold of you, something bright and undeniable. You create streaks of dark blue and black at the edges of the orb like shadows threatening to pull the light away.\n\n As you step back to admire your work, you notice the painting feels balanced yet dynamic. It's a reflection of your mixed thoughts on the [referto].\n \n \n \n The canvas stares back at you, empty and vast. You grip your brush tightly though, determined to fill it.\n\n Your first stroke is a jagged slash of dark blue, cutting across the canvas like a wound. Around it, you add streaks of gray and muted green, layering them. The colors are earthy and grounded, reflecting the stability you're trying to hold onto.\n\n At the core of the painting, you create a dense cube built from intersecting lines. It feels solid and unyielding, a symbol of the identity you've always known. But cracks start to appear in the shape as you work, with threads of violet seeping through the fractures.\n\n On the outer edges of the canvas, you paint long, sweeping lines in a metallic silver. It's almost like a shield, meant to be gaurding you. Yet, those lines blur into the background, mixing with the sharper colors.\n\n When you step back, the painting feels heavy and intense. As if it carries the weight of everything you've been struggling with. It's not comfortable to look at, to say the least, but it feels honest.\n \n\n \n \n You feel your motivation drain like air from a popped balloon. Expressing yourself sounds too difficult. Art is supposed to be fun, isn't it? \n\n You start with a blob of paint—a literal blob. You grab a large brush, dunk it in into the first color you see (a bright orange), and smack it onto the canvas. The thick splatter creates a satisfying sound.\n\n Fueled by impulse, you grab another brush and swipe blue streaks across the big blob, crossing it in random directions. You add green polka dots for no reason whatsoever and decide the whole thing could use some glitter. You dump half a jar of it onto the wet paint.\n\n You continue your haphazard masterpiece, adding squiggles, random fingerprints, and even some water. By the time you're done, your canvas is a colorful, messy explosion. You feel oddly proud of it. It's nonsense, yes, but it's your nonsense.\n\n \"Care to explain this?\" Ms. Harper says as she gestures to the canvas. \n \n \"I saw what you did on Saturday. You can do better than this.\"\n \n \n \"I'm not sure how skilled you are at art, but I'm sure you can do better than this.\"\n \n\n \"It's about... life,\" you begin improvising. \"The orange represents, uh, the chaos of youth. The blue streaks are the boundaries of society, which we're all just trying to break free from. The glitter is like the unexpected beauty in the mess of it all.\"\n\n \"Well, I'll give you points for creativity,\" Ms. Harper says, her expression caught between skepticism and amusement. \"Although you used much more glitter than you should have.\"\n\n \"Well, it was necessary for my artistic vision,\" you waffle.\n \n\nEverything begins to wrap up, as the period is about to end. Ms. Delgado claps her hands to get everyone's attention.\n\n\"Alright, everyone, it's time to wrap up,\" she begins. \"Please bring your canvases to the drying racks carefully—carefully. Once your work is drying, clean your brushes and palettes, and don't forget to wipe down your desks before you leave.\"\n\nYou glance at your creation one last time, feeling a mix of pride, curiosity, or maybe even embarrassment. Picking up the canvas gingerly, you make your way to the drying racks. Once you make it there, you search the drying rack and slide your canvas into an empty slot. Around you, the shelves are quickly filling with an eclectic mix of styles: portraits, abstract pieces, and even a painting that looks like a dragon spitting fire at a UFO.\n\n\"Alright,\" Ms. Delgado calls out from the front of the room. \"Make sure everything is cleaned up before you leave! Treat these pieces with care—they're the foundation of your next masterpiece.\"\n\nYou head back to your desk, grabbing your brushes and palette to clean. The sink area is crowded, so you wait your turn. You idly watch as the other students chatter about their paintings. As you rinse your brushes under the running water, you can't help but think about the [referto]. A moment of self-expression felt fulfilling, for some weird reason.\n\nOnce everything is clean and packed away, the bell rings, announcing the end of class. You wipe down your desk and grab your bag. You leave the classroom, thinking as you head toward the rest of your day.\n\n[Choice: Finish up school]",

You make your way over, feeling the crunch of the grass beneath your shoes. You're not planning to stay here long—just long enough to sit in the silence and forget about everything for a few minutes.\n\nThere's something soothing about the emptiness, the stillness of the field. You take a deep breath and settle down on the bleachers, letting your thoughts drift away for a while.\n\nThen you spot him—Jordan.\n\nHe's alone on the field, running drills with single-minded intensity. He breathes hard and fast, but he doesn't stop. His footwork is sharp, his movements calculated. He zigzags between cones and sprints around the field. Jordan's expression is focused and grim, as if every step he takes is a battle.\n\nYou wonder whether to interrupt. You think he's just doing some extra conditioning before the start of the football season. There's a tension in his posture and a slight grimace on his face, though. It seems to keep him moving even when he's aching. You watch silently, but even as the minutes tick by, Jordan doesn't slow down. \n\nFinally, after what feels like an eternity, he takes a breather. He stands there, bent at the waist, breathing heavily. Sweat drips down from his hair to his forehead, and his chest rises and falls as he tries to catch his breath. He looks up at the sky for a second, and then he's back to stretching.\n\nYou sit there, unsure of what to do.

School's been busy.\"\n\n \"Just know you can talk to me about anything, alright?\" he reasures. \n\n \"Thanks, Dad,\" you respond.\n\n \"Anytime,\" he replies, leaning back in the armchair. \"Now, what's on the TV? Hopefully there's something good. I don't want to watch reality cooking shows, I've seen far too many of those.\"\n\n You let him ramble on.

At first, it seems like he doesn't notice, but his eyes flicker up in your direction as he stops to catch his breath. There's a flicker of surprise in his expression as if he didn't expect anyone to be watching. He doesn't acknowledge you immediately, keeping his distance. But after a long beat, he gives a curt nod.\n\n \"Thanks,\" he says, his voice a little strained but low. He doesn't elaborate or try to make conversation at all, and after a few seconds, he's back to stretching. There's a subtle shift in his posture—his shoulders are a little less tense, his movements less rigid.\n\n \n You decide to stay where you are, settling into the cool metal of the bleachers. From your vantage point, you can observe Jordan without interrupting him. You watch him sprint, feet pounding against the turf, and can't help but wonder what drives him so hard.\n\n As Jordan passes by the bleachers, his eyes briefly flick to you. He seems to hesitate for a fraction of a second like he's considering saying something, but then he looks away. He returns to sprinting back and forth across the lonely football field.\n \n\nYou watch Jordan for a little longer, debating whether to say anything.

It's impressive.\"\n\nJordan blinks, caught off guard. For a moment, he just stares. Your eyes meet across the lonely football field before he shakes his head and speaks up. \"It's not a big deal.\"\n\n\"How is it not?\" you counter, feeling a little braver. \"Most people wouldn't push themselves this hard.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, it's not like I have a choice,\" he mutters, letting out a short laugh. \"You don't even know me.

Some tension seems to have eased. You watch for a while, and when you finally decide to go home, Jordan is still powering through a workout.

Groggy and disoriented, you turn on your phone and check the time.\n\n7:45 AM.\n\nYour heart lurches. If you didn't get to school in fifteen minutes, you'd be late for your first class of the day. Today was a Wednesday, which meant your schedule was a little weird. Wednesdays are club days, so you will have your first class of the day at 8. The time usually reserved for homeroom was moved to before lunch. You check the clock again and a minute has passed while you were thinking about your school's schedule.\n\n\"Shit!\" you mutter, kicking off your blanket and scrambling out of bed. No time to brush your teeth, no time to think—you just have to get to school. By the time you get your shoes on and dash out the door, your hair is a mess, and you're certain you forgot something important.\n\nYou begin to run, your shoes pounding against the pavement as you try to calculate how much time you have left before your first class. By the time you reach school, your lungs are burning, and you're sure you look like you just stumbled out of a storm. The hallway is eerily quiet, and you make your way to Mr. Reeds' English Literature class. \n\nJust as you reach the door, you pause for a moment, leaning against the wall to catch your breath. Your hair's a mess, your shirt feels slightly damp, and you're acutely aware of how disheveled you must look. \n\nYou push open the door.\n\nYou interrupt Mr. Reeds mid-sentence. The entire class turns to look at you as the door creaks open.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Yoon,\" Mr. Reeds says. \"Have you decided to grace us with your presence after all?\"\n\nYou wince, managing a sheepish apology.\n\nHe gestures toward your seat. \"Take your seat, we are discussing The Metamorphosis. I trust you've done your homework?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I did it,\" you manage to say as you slide into your chair. You avoid eye contact with everyone, and your heart is racing.

So what's the vibe we're going to go for here?\"\n\n \"It's all about the tension,\" you reply, gesturing vaguely. \"This mix of anger, fear, and love. Maybe I'm begging you not to go, trying to convince you to leave town instead of fighting. You're caught between what's expected of you and what you actually want.\"\n\n \"Alright, alright, I see it,\" Jordan says as he leans back, his brow furrowed in thought. \"I'm trying to act all noble and self-sacrificing, and you're breaking down because you think I'm gonna die.\"\n\n \"So, the scene starts with us meeting somewhere—maybe in the garden behind my family's house,\" you begin, trying to flesh out the details. \"It's late, and we're both looking over our shoulders, paranoid about someone catching us. The conversation starts tense, like we're both trying to pretend everything's fine. But then it'll escalate into this emotional mess.\"\n\n \"Okay, I'll be talking about how I have no choice and that it's about honor,\" he nods slowly, starting to get into it. \"You can talk about your need to keep me from getting killed.\"\n\n \"Exactly,\" you say, grinning. \"You get to play the tragic hero and I get to play the desperate one.\"\n\n The two of you quickly sketch out the dialogue, trading ideas and occasionally arguing over the phrasing. Jordan's surprisingly invested, offering suggestions. By the time Mr. Bennet announces the end of brainstorming time, you're feeling confident. The scene you've created is heavy, emotional, and full of stakes—exactly what Mr. Bennet had demanded. As Jordan leans back with a satisfied look, you can't help but feel like the two of you might actually be able to pull this off. And maybe, just maybe, you're starting to see a different side of Jordan—one that isn't so bad after all.\n\n \n \"Alright, picture this,\" you say, crossing your arms and glancing at Jordan with a small grin. \"Your character sneaks into my family's masquerade ball. You're in disguise, trying to blend in, but you risk everything to pull me aside for a private conversation.\"\n\n \"So I'm basically James Bond?\" Jordan asks, raising an eyebrow. \"Sounds risky.\"\n\n \"Exactly, we're talking tension,\" you say, gesturing animatedly. \"Every word we say has to be whispered because we're surrounded by people who'd lose it if they knew you were here. It's a mix of fear, urgency, and forbidden romance.\"\n\n \"Alright, and what are we talking about? Just catching up, or are we plotting something big?\"\n\n \"It could go either way,\" you say, shrugging. You're already imagining the scene. \"But I'm thinking of something simple. You're here to tell me it's getting too dangerous for us to keep meeting. Maybe you're trying to say goodbye, but I don't want to let you go.\"\n\n Jordan tilts his head, considering what you're saying. \"So we're whispering like we're in a spy movie, throwing in some emotional tension, and then it'll end with one of us walking away. Short and dramatic, I've got it.\"\n\n With the plan sketched out, you quickly decide on some key beats: the initial meeting, the tension of being surrounded by people, and the dramatic goodbye as Jordan's character reluctantly leaves the ball. The details fall into place, with Jordan offering simple but effective suggestions. By the time Mr. Bennet calls for the brainstorming to stop, you feel confident about the scene. The masquerade setting, the tension, and the emotional stakes all feel like they'll play well. And working with Jordan isn't as bad as you thought it'd be.\n \n\n[Choice: Act it out]",

In front of the stage, your peers sit with varying degrees of interest. Some seem interested, some doodle in their notebooks, and some seem to be more concerned about their own performance than yours.\n\n You take a deep breath, step into the role, and start the scene.\n\n \"If anyone sees us together, it's over,\" you say, your voice hushed but filled with urgency as you turn toward Jordan. \"You know what my father would do if he knew you were here.\"\n\n You soon realize your fears of Jordan not trying were unnecessary. Jordan shifts his stance, his hands clenched at the sides. \"And what would you have me do?\" he asks, his voice steady but laced with frustration. \"Run away like a coward? Leave you here to face them alone? That's not who I am. You know that.\"\n\n You shake your head and pace slightly, letting the emotions build. \"This isn't about bravery,\" you reply, your tone cracking just enough to hint at desperation. \"It's about survival. If you fight my brother, he'll kill you. You don't know what he's capable of.\"\n\n Jordan straightens, his jaw tightening. \"Then so be it,\" he says, stepping toward you. \"If this is the price I have to pay to protect my honor and what we have, then I'll face it. I'm not afraid to die.\"\n\n The words hang in the air, heavy with tension. You feel the room watching, the silence thick around you. This is the moment.\n\n \n The classroom quiets as you and Jordan step into the center of the stage. Mr. Bennet adjusts his scarf, settling in with an expectant smile as he leans against this desk. The other students sit in front of the stage, their eyes flicking toward the two of you. Some seem curious while others are only half paying attention.\n\n You glance at Jordan, who gives you a barely perceptible nod. His posture is relaxed but purposeful, and despite his usual attitude, you can tell he's ready to perform.\n\n You begin the scene, your voice hushed but urgent. \"What are you doing here?\" you whisper, looking around the imaginary ballroom with paranoia. \"If anyone sees you, it's over. You're risking everything by coming here.\"\n\n Jordan adjusts his stance, his imaginary mask firmly in place as he keeps his tone low and steady. \"I had to see you,\" he replies, his eyes darting to the invisible crowd around you. \"This might be the last time. Your father's already suspicious. If he finds out, I'm done.\"\n\n You let your gaze flicker to the crowd, then back at him, your voice laced with panic. \"Then why come at all? Why risk everything just for a conversation?\"\n\n \"Because I couldn't leave without telling you the truth,\" Jordan says, taking a step closer. \"This isn't just about us anymore—it's about what they'll do if we're caught. I can't lose you like this.\"\n\n The intensity builds as you both weave the tension of secrecy into every line. The room feels smaller and quieter as the rest of the class seems to hold its breath.

You grab his arm, your eyes wide with fear and frustration. \"You're not protecting anything by throwing your life away! If you die, this—all of this—dies with you!\" Your hands tremble slightly as you step back. \"I can't lose you too. Please... Please don't do this.\"\n \n \n You keep your voice steady, your tone subdued but firm. \"You're not protecting anything by going through with this. You're letting them win. Don't you see that? If you fight him, they'll get exactly what they want—both of us destroyed. There's another way. There has to be.\"\n \n\n \"And what other way is there?\" Jordan responds, his voice quieter now, filled with conflict. \"Do you want me to run and hide while they call me a coward? I can't live like that.\"\n\n You feel the weight of his words, and for a moment, the room falls silent. The energy between the two of you is electric, the stakes clear to everyone watching.\n\n Finally, Jordan turns away, his shoulders stiff. \"This is the only way,\" he says, his voice low. \"I'll fight him... and I'll win. For us.\"\n\n You step forward, reaching out as if to stop him but letting your hand drop before it reaches his shoulder. \"You don't have to do this,\" you say, your voice breaking. \"But if you are going to... promise me you'll come back.\"\n\n Jordan pauses, glancing over his shoulder. For a moment, he looks at you, his usual stoicism breaking into something softer. \"I promise.\"\n\n With that, he walks off, the sound of his footsteps echoing in the quiet room.\n\n The silence stretches for a moment after Jordan's final line and exit, the room caught in the scene. Then, as if on cue, Mr. Bennet rises dramatically from his perch on the desk, clapping his hands together as if he just witnessed a masterpiece.\n\n \"Magnificent!\" he exclaims, his scarf trailing behind him as he steps forward. \"[name], Jordan—what you've just given us is nothing short of theater!\" His voice carries across the room, and you feel the weight of everyone's attention as Mr. Bennet gestures to you both, his expression one of pure delight.\n\n \n Mr. Bennet points at you, his eyes sparkling. \"[name], my boy, that was raw emotion! You threw yourself into that scene with abandon—your desperation was palpable! When you grabbed Jordan's arm, I could feel the stakes rising; the fear, the love, the anger—it all poured out of you!\" He presses a hand to his heart as if moved.\n\n \"Your voice carried the weight of someone who was truly fighting for their life!\" he continues, pacing slightly as he speaks. \"You weren't just acting; you truly were that character. The trembling hands, the way your voice cracked at just the right moment—it was sublime! That's the kind of energy that turns good theater into unforgettable theater.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet then turns to Jordan, his tone still encouraging but a touch more measured. \"And Jordan, you played an excellent counterpoint. The stoicism and restraint—it created a brilliant contrast to [name]'s fervor. But remember: even in moments of calm, there's fire beneath the surface. Let us feel that conflict simmering, that turmoil threatening to boil over. Still, very well done.\"\n\n Your drama teacher steps back, looking at the class. \"Show of hands for those here who felt stakes in that scene!\" Several students raise their hands and a surge of pride rips through you.\n \n \n Mr. Bennet nods approvingly, stepping forward. \"[name], Jordan—excellent work. The scene carried the tension it needed, and you both stayed grounded in your roles. [name], you brought a quiet intensity to the scene that worked beautifully. The measured tone and the pacing of your words, they all gave the impression of someone holding back their emotions. It was subtle yet effective.\"\n\n He pauses, tilting his head thoughtfully. \"That being said, don't be afraid to let go just a little more. There's a fine line between subtlety and holding back too much. Your character was desperate, but you could've pushed that edge a little more. You could've let us see the cracks forming in the calm exterior. But overall, very strong work.\"\n\n \"And Jordan, your restraint played nicely against [name]'s steadiness,\" Mr. Bennet says, turning to Jordan with a slight smile. \"It added a layer of tension to the scene, like a rubber band stretched just short of snapping. It was really well done, but next time, I'd love to see you let that band snap. Just for a moment, of course. The contrast would be electric.\"\n\n Stepping back, your drama teacher addresses the room. \"Now, who here felt the weight of their scene? Raise your hands!\" A few students raise their hands, nodding in agreement, while others murmur quietly.\n \n\n Mr. Bennet clasps his hands together once again, his tone shifting back to his usual theatrical cheer. \"Take your seats, and let's move on to the next pair!\"\n\n As you and Jordan head back to your seats, you catch a few murmurs from your classmates. Someone whispers, \"That was intense,\" while another says, \"I could never pull that off.\" Jordan's unfazed, as usual, but you smile.\n\n \n \n \n \n You take a bold step forward, grabbing Jordan by the lapels of his imaginary disguise. Your voice rises with urgency, but you keep it low enough to maintain the illusion of secrecy. \"Then stay!\" you say, making your hands tremble. \"Don't leave! If you walk away, it's over. All of it! If you mean what you say, don't you dare walk out of that door.\"\n \n \n You keep your movements restrained, letting your voice carry the weight of the emotion. \"Then why leave at all?\" you ask. \"Why start something you're too afraid to finish? You say you can't lose me, but every time you leave, you do exactly that. So tell me, truly tell me, is this goodbye again?\"\n \n\n \"You think I want to leave?\" Jordan leans in slightly, his tone quiet but charged. \"I don't have a choice. If they catch me here, they'll kill me. You'll hate me even more for bringing this down on you.\"\n\n Your eyes meet his, and for a moment, the room feels charged with unspoken words. You step back, glancing through the crowd as though weighing his words. \n\n \"Then go,\" you say, your voice trembling slightly. \"If you're afraid, just go. But don't come back unless you're ready to fight for this. For us.\"\n\n Jordan hesitates, his jaw tightening. He looks at you for a long moment before turning away, his shoulders stiff with resolve. \"I'll come back, I promise,\" he says, his voice low and determined. \"When it's safe. When I can give you the life you deserve. Stay safe... for me.\"\n\n With that, he walks off, leaving you standing alone in the imaginary ballroom as the scene closes.\n\n The classroom is silent for a moment after the scene concludes, the tension lingering in the air. Then, as if snapping out of a trance, Mr. Bennet leaps to his feet, clapping with unbridled enthusiasm. \"Bravo!\" he exclaims, his voice booming across the entire room. \"An excellent performance—both of you! Let's talk about what made it work.\"\n\n \n Mr. Bennet turns to you first, his eyes sparkling with excitement. \"[name]! My dear boy, that was passion incarnate! When you grabbed Jordan's lapels, I felt the electricity—your desperation, your plea, your unwillingness to let go. That physicality brought the scene to life. You weren't just delivering lines; you were embodying the moment and your character. Your movements and your trembling hands all told a story before you even began speaking. That's the kind of boldness that makes an audience forget they're watching a play and feel like they're living it.\"\n\n \"Take note, everyone!\" your drama teacher gestured toward the class, addressing them with dramatic flair. \"This is what happens when you commit to the stakes with your whole being. [name] gave us tension, emotion, and action—all in one package. It was truly inspiring.\"\n\n Turning to Jordan, Mr. Bennet smiles. \"Jordan, your restraint worked beautifully against [name]'s intensity. You gave us a solid anchor, someone who felt steady but conflicted, which only amplified [name]'s raw desperation. It was a perfect counterbalance. Well done to the both of you!\"\n\n You feel a rush of pride as several students nod in agreement, a few murmuring words of praise. The spark of confidence from your bold choice lingers as you head back to your seat, feeling like you've made a real impact.\n \n \n Mr. Bennet folds his arms and nods thoughtfully as he addresses you. \"[name], a restrained performance can be just as powerful as an explosive one, and you proved that. The quiet intensity you brought to the scene gave the impression of someone teetering on the edge but holding it together just enough to make the heartbreak even more poignant.\"\n\n \"However, I must say, there were moments where I wanted just a little more,\" Mr. Bennet says, his expression contemplative. \"A step closer, a hand reaching out—something to show the internal conflict bubbling beneath the surface. Don't be afraid to take a risk and let those cracks show next time. That said, the subtlety you brought was haunting in its own way.\"\n\n \"And Jordan, your grounded performance played perfectly against [name]'s restraint,\" he says, turning to Jordan. \"The quiet tension between the two of you felt authentic and kept the scene taut. Nicely done.\"\n\n As you head back to your seat, you catch a few murmurs from the other students, most of them impressed. Although you didn't take the bold route, you feel confident in the emotional depth you brought to the performance.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

It's almost like...\"\n \n\n Before you can respond, your dad's voice calls out from the kitchen. \"[name]! Your mom's trying to tell me I can't slice a tomato straight.

He grins when you walk in, gesturing dramatically at the tomato slices. \"What do you think? They're pretty straight, huh?\"\n\n \"Looks fine to me,\" you reply, trying to keep your voice steady.\n\n Your mom walks in behind you, but instead of joining the conversation, she leans against the counter, watching you with an unreadable expression.\n\n \"Are you sure you're fine?\" she presses. \"You look... Never mind.\"\n\n \"What's going on?\" your dad asks, looking up. \"Is everything alright with you two?\"\n\n \"Yeah, it's fine,\" you say quickly, forcing a smile.\n\n Your mom doesn't reply but her brows knit tighter. She sighs and turns back to the stove, but you can feel the weight of her lingering unease.\n\n \n \"[name]! Your mom's trying to tell me I can't slice a tomato straight,\" you hear your dad's voice say from the kitchen. \"Come settle this for us!\"\n\n You make your way over to the kitchen and see your dad with a cutting board and knife.

They're pretty straight, huh?\"\n\n \"They look fine to me,\" you reply.\n\n \"Great, let's get ready to eat then,\" you dad says with a wide grin on his face.\n \n\n[Choice: Get to eating dinner]",

Your dad is already serving himself a very generous portion of the roasted chicken, while your mom fusses over the mashed potatoes. The warm, savory smell of the meal mingles with the quiet hum of casual conversation.\n\nLily is glued to her phone, idly scrolling through some app with one hand while spearing a bread roll with her fork in the other. She hasn't even glanced in your direction yet, too absorbed in the latest social media trend or middle school drama.\n\n<<if [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n Your mom, on the other hand, is far more attentive. She's sitting across from you, her eyes flickering to your face every few seconds, though she's careful not to linger too long.\n \n\n\"So, [name], how's school?\" your dad asks as he slathers butter onto a roll. \"Your mom said today was the first day of clubs. That's new, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, they're every Wednesday,\" you reply, eating some mashed potatoes. \"It's mandatory for every student to be in a club.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" your dad nods approvingly. \"Clubs are a great way to meet people and get involved. What did you decide to do? Sports? Art? Something else?\"\n\n \n \"I joined the Academic Club,\" you respond.\n\n \"Academic, huh?\" your dad says, a smile growing on his face. \"Great choice, it'll look great when you're applying to college.\"\n\n \"Yeah, we played some trivia today,\" you say. \"Later though, we might even join academic competitions and stuff.\"\n\n \"That's great, good call,\" your dad says, a proud expression on his face.\n\n \n \"I decided to join the Occult Club,\" you respond.\n\n \"The Occult Club?\" your dad says, furrowing his eyebrows. \"What exactly do you do there?\"\n\n \"We just focus on researching and analyzing trends like this,\" you say, covering what the Occult Club is really about. \"It's actually very interesting, I swear.\"\n\n \"Hmm, alright,\" your dad says, clearly still uncertain about your choice. \n\n \n \"I decided to join the Fashion Club,\" you respond.\n\n \"The Fashion Club?\" your dad says, taking a second to process what you just said. \"Is it for trying on clothes?\"\n\n \"Yeah, we like, sketch dreams and craft masterpieces,\" you say, trying to make the Fashion Club sound as good as possible. \"We work really hard, it's not just putting on clothes and stuff.\"\n\n \"I guess I can see how that would be a good choice,\" your dad nods his head.\n\n \n \"I decided to join the Yearbook Club,\" you respond.\n\n \"Oh, that's interesting,\" your dad says, rubbing his stubbled chin as he thinks. \"I'm assuming you work on making the school yearbook?\"\n\n \"Yeah, we voted on the theme for the yearbook today,\" you say. \"I thought it would be nice to contribute to the yearbook since it's my senior year.\"\n\n \"That's a good call,\" your dad says, a proud expression on his face.\n \n\nYou nod along, taking a bite of chicken. The conversation shifts as your dad begins talking about his day at work, filling the room with anecdotes you've heard a million times. Your mom chimes in occasionally, \n \n<<if [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n but her attention keeps drifting back to you. \n\n \n a smile on her face as she engages with your dad. \n \n \nLily stays quiet, still scrolling on her phone, until she suddenly looks up.\n\n<<if [d7tellLily] is true and [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n \"Why are you looking at [name] like that, Mom?\" Lily asks. She quickly glances at you and winks subtly, reminding you that she knows about the [referto].\n\n \"You don't notice... something different about your brother, Lily?\" your mom asks.\n\n Lily looks at you and dramatically inspects your face. \"Looks the same as always to me. Same old ugly [name].\"\n\n \"Do not call your brother ugly, Lily,\" your mom says, sighing.\n\n \"I'm just being honest!\" she says, starting a back-and-forth with Mom. She gives you a subtle look and smiles as she takes the attention off you.\n\n \n <<if [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n \"So, are you doing something different lately, [name]?\" Lily says casually, her voice low enough so that only you can hear. \"New skincare routine or something?\"\n\n Your heart skips a beat, but you keep your expression neutral, stabbing a piece of chicken with your fork. \"Nope, just same old me.\"\n\n \"Really?\" Lily asks, raising an eyebrow. \"Because you're looking polished. Pretty smooth, to be honest.\"\n\n Your dad, too busy laughing at his own unfunny joke, doesn't catch the exchange, and neither does your mom. But Lily's eyes remain locked on yours, her expression unreadable but intrigued.\n\n \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" you mutter.\n\n \"Yeah, sure, that's why Mom's been looking at you so weird this whole time,\" Lily jabs. She pops a bread roll into her mouth, shrugging as if it's no big deal. \"But whatever you say, I guess.\"\n \n \n \"Can I get some of the mashed potatoes?\" she asks, putting down her phone for just a second.\n\n \"Of course you only put down the phone when you need food,\" you joke, letting out a loud sigh in mock disappointment.\n\n \"Look, the food's really good today,\" Lily replies. \"Can't blame me for eating good. Also, some drama is going on that I can't miss.\"\n \n \n\nThe conversation around the table slows as everyone finishes eating. Your dad leans back in his chair with a satisfied sigh. \"Now that was a meal,\" he says, reaching for some water. \"Props to the lovely chef.\"\n\n\"Glad you liked it,\" your mom says with a smile. \"[name], can you grab the dishes and bring them to the sink?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure,\" you reply, standing up and starting to clear the table. \n\nAs you bring the plates to the sink, your mom starts rinsing them off. \n \n<<if [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n She glances at you with that same thoughtful expression she's had all evening. \"You were quiet tonight,\" she says softly, keeping her tone casual but curious.\n\n \"Just tired, you know?\"\n\n She nods, but there's hesitation in her expression, like she wants to say more. \n \n\n\"Don't stay up too late,\" she warns. \"You've got school tomorrow, you have to be well rested.\"\n\n\"Got it, I'll sleep early,\" you say.\n\n\"You're off the hook for today, then,\" your mom laughs gently, wiping her hands on a towel. \"Go relax a bit before bed.\"\n\n[Choice: Go to your room]",

Mr. Reeds continues his lecture, pacing in front of the room. \n\n\"Now, what was I talking about before our late arrival?\" he asks, giving you a pointed glance. \"Ah, yes. Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis. The opening is one of the most famous in literature, and for good reason. Does anyone remember how it starts?\"\n\nHe pauses, scanning the room briefly. Noticing how silent the room is, he continues.\n\n\"Gregor Samsa wakes up one morning to find he's been transformed into a monstrous insect. But let's not focus too much on what kind of creature he's become. Kafka avoids giving us a clear image, and that's very intentional. The transformation isn't just physical—it's symbolic. The question we need to ask is: what does Gregor's condition represent? What is Kafka trying to tell us about alienation, identity, or even the human condition?\"\n\nHe begins pacing slowly in front of the whiteboard, gesturing with the book in his hand.\n\n\"In these opening pages, we see Gregor's first reaction to his transformation. What's interesting, and what I'm sure you all noticed, is how... mundane his response is. He's not screaming or panicking. Instead, he's worried about being late for work. Why do you think that is?\"\n\nThe entire class remains silent again. Mr. Reeds looks a little disappointed, but he seems used to it. You start to drift off, wondering if you should continue to pay attention to what Mr. Reeds is saying.\n\n \n \nYou should totally focus on the lecture to see how [name]'s transformations relate to a classic piece of literature about transformation.

It's absurd, but it also says something about the pressure he's under. Gregor's value, to himself and his family, is entirely tied to his ability to work. Think about that: he's reduced to a role, not a person. How does that relate to the theme of dehumanization?\"\n\n He pauses at the whiteboard and picks up a marker, jotting down keywords as he speaks.\n\n <ul> \n <li>Alienation</li>\n <li>Dehumanization</li>\n <li>Absurdity</li>\n <li>Identity</li>\n </ul> \n\n \"Kafka isn't interested in a neat, tidy narrative. He really wants us to feel Gregor's disorientation and fear, his isolation. Everything about the writing is designed to make us uncomfortable. To make us think about how we define ourselves, and how others define us.\"\n\n You jot down as much as you can, your thoughts still scattered from your rushed morning. \n\n \"Now, [name],\" Mr. Reeds calls on you. You perk up, a little worried. \n \n \n \"Care to share your thoughts on Gregor's transformation? Why do you think Kafka chose such an unusual physical change to begin the story?\"\n\n You quickly open the homework on your laptop. You read over what you wrote and freeze for a moment. The words you'd written for the homework assignment flicker in your mind, along with thoughts of your own transformation. You feel the weight of the question, and it feels like more than just a classroom discussion.\n\n Clearing your throat, you speak. \"I think Kafka uses Gregor's physical transformation to show how much of his identity is tied to his role in society. Gregor doesn't really stop to think about what happened to him or even how he feels about it. If anything, he panics over being late to work, like his worth is only measured by what he can do for his family or his boss. He's not really seen as a person, just a worker or provider.\"\n\n Mr. Reeds nods, clearly approving of your answer. \"Interesting observation, [name]. Gregor's immediate concern with his obligation rather than his new form speaks volumes about his sense of self-worth. Why do you think Franz Kafka chose to start the story this way?\"\n\n You can't help but hesitate for a moment, your mind pulling at the threads of Gregor's story and your own. \"I think Kafka's trying to show how fragile identity can be when it's tied to external things—jobs, responsibilities, even how others see you,\" you say cautiously. \"Gregor is still the same person inside but once his body changes, everything about how he sees himself and how he's treated starts to unravel.\"\n\n As you speak, you feel an odd twist in your stomach. The parallels to your own life are impossible to ignore. Like Gregor, you've felt the same inside, but you've also felt the weight of how others might perceive the changes in you. It's unsettling and strange, as you're aware of how you're changing but unable to stop it.\n\n \"That's an excellent point, thank you [name],\" Mr. Reeds says. \"Gregor's identity becomes unstable because it's so dependent on the expectations and perceptions of others. This makes his physical transformation not just a literal event, but a deeply symbolic one. Does anyone want to add to [name]'s analysis?\"\n\n The discussion continues as Mr. Reeds is forced to call on another victim. Your mind lingers on what you just said though. It's not just Gregor's transformation you're analyzing anymore—it's your own.\n \n \n \"What are your thoughts on the theme of alienation in the first ten pages of The Metamorphosis? It's a concept that seems central to Gregor's experience so far.\"\n\n You sit up straighter, opening the homework on your laptop. The words you'd written swim in your mind, along with the uncomfortable parallels to your own situation. After a moment of gathering your thoughts, you begin.\n\n \"I think Gregor's transformation creates a deep sense of alienation for him,\" you say. \"The moment he wakes up as an insect, he's cut off from everything that connected him to his normal life. He can't work or explain himself, he's basically trapped. The people around him don't see him anymore—just the thing he's become.\"\n\n Mr Reeds nods thoughtfully. \"An insightful take, [name]. Gregor's inability to communicate with his family definitely heightens his isolation. But why do you think Kafka makes such a point of showing that disconnect so early in the story?\"\n\n You glance at your laptop, your own words staring back at you like a mirror. You take a deep breath before speaking. \"I think Kafka's showing how easily someone can become invisible when they don't meet the expectations of the people around them. Gregor's family relied on him to provide, but once he can't fulfill that role anymore, they don't know how to treat him. It's not just his body that's changed—his place in their lives has too. I believe that's why he feels so isolated.\"\n\n Mr. Reeds' expression brightens with approval. \"Exactly. Kafka often explored the idea of people being alienated from those closest to them. Gregor's transformation becomes a physical representation of that emotional and social distance. Do you think Gregor felt this way even before his transformation?\"\n\n \"Probably,\" you admit, your voice quieter. The question strikes a little too close to home. \"I think the transformation just makes it more obvious. It forces everyone to see the distance that was already there.\"\n\n Your own transformation has been creating a quiet distance between you and your family. It's been difficult to keep it hidden. Difficult to avoid the questions they throw at you. The longer you stay silent though, the more alone you feel. Like Gregor, you're starting to wonder if anyone would even try to understand, or if they'd just see what's on the surface and treat you differently.\n\n \"Thank you for your contribution, [name],\" Mr. Reeds says. \"Does anyone want to add to Mr. Yoon's analysis?\"\n\n The discussion moves on as Mr. Reeds is forced to call on another victim. The knot in your chest remains, though, tied by the thoughts of the secret you're carrying and the alienation that grows with it.\n \n \n \"Let's hear your thoughts. How do you see family expectations shaping Gregor's response to his transformation?\"\n\n You feel a flutter of nerves as all eyes turn your way. You draw a deep breath and focus on the homework on the computer in front of you. The words you wrote about Gregor resonate more deeply than you'd like to admit, but you push through.\n\n \"I think Gregor's transformation puts a spotlight on how much pressure he's under to meet his family's expectations,\" you begin. \"What stood out to me was how his first reaction when turned into an insect was guilt. He's panicking because he's worried he won't be able to go to work and provide for his family. It's like... his sense of self-worth is completely tied to what he can do for them, not who he is.\"\n\n Mr. Reeds nods, his expression thoughtful. \"An excellent observation, [name]. Gregor's immediate concern for his family's financial situation does suggest how much of his identity has been consumed by that responsibility. Why do you think Kafka chose to make the family dynamic such a central part of the story?\"\n\n You glance at what you wrote again, your thoughts swimming. \"I think it's to show how unhealthy that kind of relationship can be,\" you say, your voice gaining confidence. \"Gregor's family doesn't seem to care about him as a person—they care about what he can do for them. The moment he can't work, he stops being their son and becomes a burden. I think Kafka's trying to say that basing your worth on what you can do for others is dangerous.\"\n\n Mr. Reeds leans against his desk, crossing his arm. \"That's a powerful interpretation. So would you say Gregor is complicit in this dynamic? Do you think he willingly sacrificed his individuality for his family's expectations?\"\n\n \"Maybe,\" you admit, the question hitting closer to home than you'd honestly like it to. \"I think he feels he doesn't have a choice. His family relies on him so much, and he doesn't want to let them down. But I really don't think it's fair to put all that on him. They should support him too, isn't that what family is for?\"\n\n Gregor's panic about failing his family strikes a chord, echoing your own fears. You've been changing, and though you've tried to downplay it, you can't shake the anxiety that people around you—your family, your friends—might start seeing you differently. Would they still care about you if you couldn't meet their expectations anymore?\n\n Your chest tightens at the thought. You'd written about Gregor's family only valuing him for what he could do for them, and you can't help but wonder: are you afraid of the same thing?\n\n \"Thank you for your valuable insight, [name],\" Mr. Reeds says. \"Would anyone else like to add to what Mr. Yoon said?\"\n\n The discussion continues around you, but your mind lingers on those thoughts. It's hard not to see pieces of Gregor's struggle in your own life.\n \n \n \"Why don't you share your thoughts? How does Gregor's transformation affect his ability to communicate, and what do you think Kafka might be saying through that?\"\n\n Your heart skips a beat, but you sit up straighter and glance at your homework on your laptop. The words you'd written only a week ago feel heavier now, tied too closely to your own struggles. You take a deep breath and begin.\n\n \"I think the biggest impact of Gregor's transformation is how it cuts him off from the people around him,\" you say, choosing your words carefully. \"He can hear his family right outside his door, and they're talking to him, but he can't say anything. His voice is different, and they don't understand him. That breakdown in communication makes him feel even more isolated. His family is right there, but they might as well be a light year away.\"\n\n Mr. Reeds nods, his expression thoughtful. \"An insightful observation. So would you say that the inability to communicate is what makes his transformation truly terrifying?\"\n\n \"I think so, yes,\" you reply, your voice a little steadier. \"Turning into an insect is scary enough, but the real horror comes in not being able to explain yourself or ask for help. Gregor can't even tell his family about what's happening to him or how he feels. They're supposed to care about him, but because he can't communicate, they start seeing him as more of a monster than a person.\"\n\n \"That's an astute interpretation,\" Mr. Reeds says, his tone encouraging. \"Now what do you think Kafka is trying to say about the importance of communication in relationships?\"\n\n \"I think he's showing how fragile communication can be,\" you say after hesitating for a moment. \"It's a warning, I suppose, about how it is to lose people if you don't make the effort to really listen to them.\"\n\n \"That's an excellent point, [name],\" Mr. Reeds smiles faintly, satisfied with your answer. \"What do the rest of you think? Is Gregor solely to blame for the communication breakdown, or do his family and society share some responsibility?\"\n\n As the discussion shifts to the broader class, you lean back in your chair, your mind lingering on your own thoughts. Gregor's isolation feels familiar. Too familiar. You've been burying a lot about the transformation deep inside, keeping it a secret. It's starting to feel like you're losing the ability to connect with the people who matter most to you. You swallow hard, trying to shake the thoughts away. They stick to you like a shadow though. The fear of being misunderstood, of losing the people you care about because they can't hear you, sits heavy in your chest.\n \n\n \n \n You can't help but drift off, bored by whatever Mr. Reeds is yapping about. You start trying to list as many North American fruits as you can. Oranges, apples, grapes, cranberries—\n\n \"[name],\" Mr. Reeds voice interrupts your thoughts. \"Why don't you share your thoughts on the first ten pages? How does Gregor's transformation serve as a metaphor?\"\n\n Your stomach drops. You hadn't been paying attention at all. You sit up straighter, trying to look composed, but you have no idea what to say.\n\n \"Well,\" you begin, stalling as you glance down at your empty notebook. \"I think Gregor's transformation into an, uh, insect is actually... a statement about the importance of... boundaries.\"\n\n \"Boundaries, huh?\" Mr. Reeds echoes, raising his eyebrows.\n\n \"Precisely,\" you say, gaining confidence for no reason. \"You see, Gregor is suddenly stuck inside his room, right? That's Kafka showing how society boxes us in. Like, if you think about it, we're all Gregor. We're all trapped by the walls of... expectation. And bugs! We can't forget about bugs. Bugs love walls, don't they? They climb on them, eat them, you know, they love walls. So Gregor becoming a bug is Kafka telling us to not let society trap us in its metaphorical walls.\"\n\n The class bursts into muffled laughs, and you hear someone whisper, \"What is he even talking about?\"\n\n Mr. Reeds on the other hand, nods very seriously, although his lips twitch. \"Interesting interpretation, [name]. And what do you think Kafka is suggesting we do about these metaphorical walls?\"\n\n \"Oh, that's real easy,\" you say. \"Kafka is saying we should break them down! Like, we should get some metaphorical bug spray, to, uhhh... deal with the walls before the bugs take over. Because bugs represent all the societal expectations crawling all over us.\"\n\n The giggles are louder now, and even Mr. Reeds looks like he's trying not to laugh. \"Very creative. I admire your enthusiasm. Let's see what the class thinks about that. Does anyone else care to weigh in on these metaphorical walls?\"\n\n Your cheeks burn but you can't help but smile a little. Kafka probably would've appreciated the absurdity of your interpretation.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue to your first club meeting]",

You look around the class and find the culprit, a bunch of dust motes dancing in the sunlight. A cluttered stage stands in the center of the room, hosting a bunch of mismatched chairs, scripts, and costumes. You put down your backpack and take a seat in the \n \n<<if [shy] > [confident]>> \n back \n\n \n front \n \n \nof the room.\n\n\"Welcome to Drama, my little thespians,\" Mr. Bennet says, a wide grin on his face as he appears from behind the curtain. Your teacher runs a hand through his messy brown hair and makes his way to the center of the stage. His long scarf—an essential part of his wardrobe—drapes dramatically over one shoulder. \"Today is a rather important day, as we're going to start preparing for our first play of the year.\"\n\nA wave of excitement, mixed with some nervousness, washes over you. You hear your classmates whispering, speculating on what the play will be and what role they'll play.\n\n\"We'll be working on one of the most famous plays of all time this time around,\" Mr. Bennet announces after the room quiets back down. \"It's one that all of you have either already read or will read soon. It's a tale of love, fate, and tragic misunderstandings. Without further ado, we'll be performing Romeo and Juliet!\"\n\nThe reaction to Mr. Bennet's announcement is polarized, to say the least. Half of the class groans while the other half gasps in excitement. Everyone begins murmuring, and you can hear a girl say, \"I hope I get to play Juliet!\"\n\n\"Now, we won't be doing much today, let alone casting students for roles,\" your drama teacher interrupts. \"But we will have to start reading the play, brainstorming characters, and warming up. The scripts are on the table—please, treat them better than the last set.\"\n\nYou stand up and make your way toward the table Mr. Bennet pointed to. You pick up the script and make your way back to your seat. You think back to when you first read Romeo and Juliet in your freshman year. Although the details are fuzzy now, you still remember the gist of the story. You can't help but think about who you would play if you could. What role might this year have in store for you?\n\n[Choice: I want to play Romeo]\n[Choice: I want to play Juliet]\n[Choice: I want to play Mercutio]\n[Choice: I want to be backstage]",

      "text": "You decide if you could, you would play Romeo. There's something about him being a star-crossed lover caught in a whirlwind of passion and tragedy. The image comes to you rather easily: standing on the stage, bathed in the spotlight, delivering heartfelt monologues about love. You already know you'd pour your soul into your performance as the audience hangs on your every line.\n\n There's something alluring about playing the lead. You'd get to explore everything from the highs of love to the depths of despair. It's intimidating though. You're not sure if you could pull off his romantic charm without feeling ridiculous. The sword fights would be a challenge as well.\n\n \n \n \n The thought catches you off guard, but you can't help but wonder: what if you played Juliet? You picture yourself dressed in a flowing gown, delivering Juliet's lines with grace and vulnerability. The balcony scene comes to mind, and you can't help but smile as you imagine gazing down at Romeo, filled with longing and conflict.\n\n Juliet's role in the story feels fascinating despite its challenge. She's strong yet vulnerable, caught between Romeo and her family. You'd step out of your comfort zone, but isn't that what acting's all about? The idea of exploring Juliet's complexity, courage, and tragic story pulls at you. \n\n \n \n \n Mercutio's name leaps to the forefront of your mind. Romeo's charismatic, witty, and bold friend seems like the kind of role you could get into. You picture yourself swaggering across the stage, delivering Mercutio's sharp one-liners. Mercutio isn't the lead, but his presence is unforgettable. He's the kind of character that leaves a lasting impression. You'd have to lean into humor, confidence, and heartbreak all at once—a blend that feels like a perfect challenge.\n\n \n \n \n You imagine working behind the scenes, helping build sets, adjusting lighting, and managing costumes. The idea of contributing to the play and its success without stepping onstage feels oddly comforting. You could easily see yourself enjoying the satisfaction of creating something tangible—like painting the backdrop or designing props. You wouldn't have to worry about memorizing lines or performing in front of an audience either, which is nice.\n \n\n\"Alright, my budding thespians,\" Mr. Bennet says, cutting through your thoughts. \"We've just learned our destiny for the semester—Romeo and Juliet, the most epic tale in the history of the English Language!\"\n\nHe pauses for effect, pacing slowly across the stage at the front of the room. \"But what is a play without passion? What is acting without connection? What is drama without...\" He stops, spinning on one foot to face the group. \"Conflict?\"\n\nYou see a few of your peers exchange amused glances, while others sit up a little straighter, drawn into his energy.\n\n\"To prepare you for the emotional stakes required to bring Shakespeare's words to life, we're going to start with a little warm-up. Improv! The sacred art of creating something from nothing.\"\n\nWith another clap, he marches toward the center of the room and gestures for everyone to stand. \"On your feet! Drama is not a spectator sport.\"\n\nChairs screech as everyone reluctantly pushes them back and shuffles into the open space. Mr. Bennet raises a single finger, halting the movement like a conductor.\n\n\"Now, this will not be your average improv,\" he says, pacing again. \"Oh no, not at all! This exercise will draw inspiration directly from our dear friend William Shakespeare himself. Each pair will embody a scenario inspired by the grand themes of Romeo and Juliet. You'll take these emotions, these stakes, and make them your own! Remember there are no wrong answers in improv, only boring ones.\"\n\n\"I will assign your pairs and scenarios. You'll have three minutes to brainstorm, craft, and rehearse your masterpiece. Then the stage will be yours! The clock starts as soon as I've finished assigning pairs. No pressure!\"\n\nHe begins pointing dramatically at students, assigning pairs with the flair of someone casting a high-stakes Broadway show. \"Emily and Theo! You are rival family members meeting in secret to make peace. Jasmine and Kevin! You are two best friends torn apart by loyalty to your families.\"\n\nWhen his gaze lands on you, a sly smile spreads across his face. \"[name]!\" he exclaims. \"You shall be paired with... Jordan!\"\n\nYou glance over at Jordan, the football star that you forgot was even in this class. He raises an eyebrow at you from across the room.\n\nMr. Bennet doesn't miss a beat, pointing a finger at the two of you. \"Your scenario: secret lovers meeting under the shadow of your families' bitter hatred!\"\n\nJordan \n \n \n sighs audibly but \n \n \nmakes his way toward you. \"Guess we're doing this,\" he mutters as he stops in front of you.\n\n\"Guess so,\" you reply.\n\n\"The clock starts now!\" Mr. Bennet sweeps his arm dramatically toward the rest of the class.\n\nThe room bursts into motion as pairs begin brainstorming their scenes, their voices filling the air with snippets of ideas. You turn to Jordan, already thinking about how to pull this off.\n\nJordan leans against a nearby desk, crossing his arms as he looks at you. \"Alright, how are we doing this?\" he asks, his voice low and even. \"Lovers meeting in secret—sounds pretty straightforward.\"\n\n\"We've got a few ways we could spin this,\" you say, turning back to Jordan and shrugging. \"It depends on how dramatic we want to go.\"\n\n\"This whole class is dramatic, might as well lean into it,\" Jordan chuckles, a faint smirk on his face.\n\n[Choice: Suggest that you act out the last meeting before a duel]\n[Choice: Suggest that you act out a secret meeting in disguise]",

The faint smell of old books and chalk dust lingers in the stale air as you step inside, taking in the rows of desks pushed together to form a large rectangle. A few students are already seated, chatting in low voices or flipping through textbooks thicker than your arm.\n\nAt the far end of the room, you spot Vincent. You chuckle to yourself, of course he's in this club. He looks up from his book and spots you. \"[name], over here!\" he calls, waving energetically.\n\nYou make your way over, dropping your bag onto the chair next to his. \"Hey, Vincent,\" you say, returning his smile.\n\n\"I can't believe you joined this club!\" Vincent says, his grin widening. \"I mean, I hoped you would join, but academic clubs aren't exactly exciting to most people.\"\n\n\"You know, I thought I'd give it a shot,\" you say, chuckling as you lean back in your chair. \"Besides, you're here, so it can't be too bad.\"\n\n\"You won't regret it, I hope,\" he laughs, the sound genuine. \"The club is great, for the most part. Sometimes we get a little too caught up with things like debate prep or advanced math problems, but it's all fun once you get into it. The people here are pretty cool too, although a few of them could work on their social skills.\"\n\nAt that moment, a tall, lanky guy with a mop of messy blond hair on his head strides to the front of the room. He's wearing a T-shirt with a pixelated dragon on it and a button pinned to his backpack that reads: I'd rather be rolling for initiative. He gestures dramatically as he addresses the group.\n\n\"Welcome, fellow scholars and adventurers, to the most noble of quests: the Academic Club!\" he declares, his voice filled with enthusiasm. \"I am your fearless leader, Max, Dungeon Master of this party of knowledge-seekers. But today, we aren't slaying dragons. Oh no. We're slaying ignorance! And the XP rewards are totally worth it.\"\n\nVincent leans over and whispers into your ear. \"As I said, some could work on their social skills.\"\n\nMax continues, pacing around the front of the room as if he's giving a motivational speech. \"Here in the Academic Club, we celebrate the ancient arts of problem-solving, trivia mastery, and intellectual combat. Whether your specialty is decoding history textbooks or wielding the magic of equations, there's a place for you here. We're like Ravenclaw, but better. Also, we have snacks.\"\n\n\"A Harry Potter reference in 2024?\" Vincent whispers, judging Max. \"The Stormlight Archive is better anyway.\"\n\n\"Do we actually have snacks?\" a girl in the back asks.\n\n\"Of course!\" Max replies, pulling out a box of donuts and setting them on a nearby desk with a flourish. \"Behold! Provisions for our mighty academic journey. Take one if you dare.\"\n\nThe group chuckles and Max claps his hands to get everyone's attention. \"Now, let's begin with introductions! Tell us your name, your academic alignment, and what you hope to get out of this merry fellowship.\"\n\nAs the introductions begin, you listen to the other members talk about their favorite subjects and their dreams of winning competitions or acing their exams. One student refers to himself as a \"literature rogue,\" while another declares he's a \"physics paladin.\" The worst part is you think they're being completely serious. Eventually, your turn to introduce yourself arrives.

Or maybe a—\"\n\n \"Oh no, no,\" you interrupt, waving a hand dismissively. \"I'm not about to start memorizing spells or whatever you guys do as a hobby. I mean, do you actually spend time on 'Rolling for Invention' or something?\"\n\n \"Rolling for initiative,\" Max corrects. \"It's from Dungeons & Dragons.

A kid in the front row lets out an indignant huff. \"There's so much more than that! It's about strategy, teamwork, and storytelling! You don't fight with math at all.\"\n\n \"Sure, whatever you say,\" you shrug, your smirk widening. \"Anyway, I'm here because Vincent bribed me with some candy. I also heard there were donuts, and I was feeling hungry. Those are the real treasures here, right?\"\n\n \"Donuts are nice, but this club is about more than snacks,\" Max raises an eyebrow, trying to keep his composure. \"The club is also about expanding your mind, testing your limits, and unlocking your inner scholar.\"\n\n \"Inner scholar, huh?\" you snort. \"Is that like when I 'level up' and get better grades? That would be great, I'm all for it.\"\n\n The room erupts in groans and all the members of the Academic Club seem very disappointed in you. \"Psst, [name],\" Vincent whispers, shifting awkwardly in his seat. \"These guys are super into this stuff, maybe tone it down a little?\"\n\n \"Well, it's good to have you,\" Max says, straightening his posture. \"Even if you're, uh, new to all this, we're here to enlighten you. Consider this your first quest: to appreciate the wonders of academia.\"\n\n \n \n \n \"Hey, I'm [name],\" you begin, glancing around the room. \"I'm not as hardcore about academics as some of you probably are, but I think learning stuff outside of class sounds really cool. Vincent's been telling me how great this club is as well, so I figured I'd give it a try.\"\n\n A few nods ripple through the room, and Vincent beams.\n\n You continue, leaning in slightly. \"I've always liked history—it's kind of like a giant collection of stories, don't you think? I guess I'm curious about how competitions and trivia games work. I've never done something like that before.\"\n\n \"History bard!\" Max says, clapping his hands together enthusiastically. \"Welcome to the team, [name]. Don't worry—if you're new to academic challenges, we'll get you trained up soon. This is like your origin story.\"\n \n\nOnce everyone finishes their introductions, Max gets everyone's attention. \"Alright, adventurers, now that we've all declared our academic alignments and formed our party, it's time for our first quest: a trivia battle!\"\n\nHe gestures toward a small table at the front of the room, where a set of buzzers are hooked up to a central console.\n\n\"Each of you will take turns competing head-to-head, answering questions on a variety of topics. Think of this as a trial by fire. The winner gets first dibs on the donuts!\"\n\nThe group chuckles and Max gestures for the first two volunteers to step up. It's not long before your turn arrives. You find yourself sitting across from Vincent, who's grinning at you.\n\n\"Alright, [name] and Vincent!\" Max declares, pretending to be a game show host. \"The next round begins now. First question!\"\n\nMax pulls out a card from a stack and reads the first question.\n\n\"This ancient Greek historian, often called the 'Father of History,' wrote Histories, a work documenting the Greco-Persian Wars.\"\n\nVincent buzzes in almost immediately.\n\n\"Herodotus!\" Vincent says triumphantly.\n\n\"Correct!\" Max says. Vincent shoots you an apologetic grin. Max moves on to the next question. \"In physics, what is the term for the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance by one degree Celsius?\"\n\nYou buzz in first this time, remembering the physics class you took last year. \"Specific heat capacity!\"\n\n\"Correct, [name]'s on the board!\" Max cheers.\n\nThe questions come quickly after that, ranging from obscure to downright impossible. You trade points back and forth with Vincent, with the other club members cheering you on. By the end of the round, you're neck-and-neck with Vincent.\n\nMax grins mischievously as he pulls out the final card. \"Alright, this one's for all the glory! In what year did the Treaty of Paris, ending the American Revolutionary War, officially come into effect?\"\n\n \n \nDon't cheat!\n \n\n[Choice: 1783]\n[Choice: 1776]",

One's a pink-frosted donut covered in glittery sprinkles, edible pearls, and a tiny candy bow. It looks adorable, and it's hard not to notice that it's the most intricately decorated one. The other is a dark chocolate donut topped with a drizzle of rich caramel and a sprinkle of sea salt. It's very understated and cool, as cool as a donut can be.\n\n[Choice: Choose the adorable donut]\n[Choice: Choose the cool donut]",

Next week, we'll dive deeper into academics and even do some strategy sessions for anyone interested in competitions.\"\n\n\"Not bad for your first meeting, huh?\" Vincent turns to you, grinning as everyone begins wrapping up.\n\n\"Yeah, it was fun,\" you admit, feeling a sense of relief. \"I didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as I did.\"\n\n\"What did I say,\" Vincent smiles. \"Stick with us, and you'll be an academic monster in no time.

      "text": "The fashion club meets in a room tucked away in the quieter wing of the school. As you approach the door, you can hear the low hum of conversation and the faint rustle of fabric. A colorful poster taped to the wall next to the door reads, \"FASHION CLUB: Where Creativity Threads Us Together.\" It's adorned with doodles of spools, needles, and vibrant outfits.\n\nYou take a deep breath to steady your nerves. You push the door open and step inside. The room is a kaleidoscope of color and texture. Bolts of fabric line one wall, while another is covered in sketches pinned to a corkboard. A few sewing machines hum in the background as members adjust fabric and focus on their stitching.\n\nJessica looks up from a table in the center of the room, her arms full of swatches. Her face lights up when she spots you. \"[name]! I didn't know you joined this club!\"\n\n\"Yeah, I thought I'd give it a shot,\" you reply, trying to mask your nervousness.\n\n\"Well, I'm glad you joined,\" she gives you a friendly smile.\n\n\"Welcome, welcome!\" you hear a voice ring out. You look to the front of the room to see a girl with curly hair, wearing an oversized sweater and ripped jeans. Her outfit makes her look lazy and put-together at the same time. You suppose that's fashion. \"We're a bit of everything here at the Fashion Club. Whatever strikes our fancy—designing, styling, learning new techniques—we try them all out! It's all about self-expression, creativity, and of course, a lot of fun.\"\n\nShe pauses, her eyes sweeping over the class. \"Before we dive into the plans for the semester, let's have all the new members introduce themselves. Don't be shy—this is a supportive space.\"\n\nYour turn to introduce yourself finally comes after some girls introduce themselves. The fact that the entire club is made up of girls slowly dawns on you as you look around. Sierra finally calls out your name and motions toward the front of the room.\n\n\"Come on up, [name],\" she says. She hesitates, looking back down at her clipboard. \"Oh, a guy joined this year! It's been a while since we had one...\"\n\nA few girls whisper quietly to each other, and you can feel your cheeks heat up slightly. How rare was it for a guy to join this club?\n\n<<if [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n \n \"[name]?\" Sierra says, continuing to look around the classroom. Her eyes rest on everyone's face, but she can't seem to point out who the guy is. A slight frown forms as she tries to match the name to a face. A few students glance at each other, and the whispers grow louder. You see Sierra's gaze flick back to the door like she's expecting you to be standing there. But no one steps forward. \"Maybe he's late?\"\n\n You're beginning to realize what's happening: Sierra can't tell you're the guy she's supposed to be calling up. In fact, none of the girls seem to have noticed yet either. You bite your lip, feeling a bit awkward as your mind races to catch up. You suddenly realize that she might not even be able to tell you're a guy at all. You haven't done anything drastic, but your changes are enough that she might just be assuming you're one of the other girls who joined.\n\n You take a deep breath, feeling the weight of the room's eyes on you as you start moving. The room is quiet, all attention fixed on you. With a small, forced smile, you step toward the front of the room. Sierra, now realizing her mistake, blushes a deep red.\n\n \"Oh my God, I'm so sorry!\" she blurts out, her voice higher than usual. \"I totally didn't mean to—uh, I mean, I should have known you were the new guy, but, uh, I was just... I wasn't expecting—\"\n\n She stops herself, realizing she's not making things better for herself. She presses her clipboard to her chest like a shield, clearly flustered.\n\n \"I've been in this club since my freshman year, and I've never seen a guy join,\" she says, her hands fidgeting. Her usual confidence is nowhere to be found. She takes a deep breath and forces a smile, pulling herself together the best she can. \"Okay, uh... sorry again. Why don't you go ahead and introduce yourself? We're all excited to have you!\"\n\n \n \n Sierra spots you in the crowd and smiles warmly. \"Here, get up and introduce yourself!\"\n\n You make your way to the front of the room. You think about how you should introduce yourself, wanting to make a good first impression.\n \n\n[Choice: Introduce yourself confidently]\n[Choice: Introduce yourself shyly]",

Plus, I'm always up for a challenge.'\n\n You give a quick wink and sit back down.\n\n \n \n \n\n You stand up a little straighter, feeling the weight of all the eyes on you. You clear your throat and try to keep your voice steady. \"Uh, hey everyone, I'm [name],\" you say, your hands nervously fiddling with the hem of your shirt. \"I, uhh... I'm not really sure what I'm doing here, but I thought joining might help with some fashion stuff. I guess. Yeah, that's it. Thanks.\"\n\n You sit down quickly, your face burning a little with embarrassment. You hope you didn't sound too awkward.\n \n\nSierra crosses your name off her list and looks up with a bright smile. \"Alright, welcome to the Fashion Club, everyone! I'm really excited to see so many of you here today. Today's going to be a chill intro meeting, but I've got a couple of activities planned so we can start getting to know each other more. Let me go over what we do in the club first.\"\n\nShe clicks a button on a remote, and a PowerPoint presentation appears on the whiteboard behind her. As expected from the fashion club, the slides are simple but stylish.\n\n\"Basically, this club is all about fashion design, styling, and personal expression. We do a lot here, from sketching outfit concepts to upcycling old clothes into fresh designs. Some of you might be here to refine your skills, and others may be complete newbies to this hobby. That's all fine! We're here to learn and grow together.\"\n\nShe presses a button to go to another slide.\n\n\"Throughout the year, we'll have design challenges, styling contests, and even collaborate with the theater department for costume design. We also have an Instagram account where we showcase everyone's work!\"\n\nSierra gestures to a stack of fabric swatches and magazines on a nearby table. \"For today, let's keep it light,\" she says. \"Use the magazines, cutouts, and fabric pieces to create a mood board! You can create a collage that represents your personal style or what inspires you. You'll work in small groups so everyone gets to share ideas.\"\n\nShe divides the room into groups of four or five. Jessica is in your group, along with two other girls who introduce themselves as Ava and Clara. The table between you is soon piled high with colorful materials, scissors, and glue sticks. Jessica flips through a magazine with a thoughtful expression, Ava eagerly grabs fabric swatches, and Clara collects some bold, colorful cutouts.

You come across images of tailored suits, crisp button-ups, and well-fitted coats. The sharp lines and neutral tones feel grounding, offering balance amidst the variety of materials you have to work with.\n\n \"That's an interesting choice,\" Jessica says, glancing over. \"I wouldn't have thought to go that direction.\"\n\n \"It's just what stood out to me,\" you say, carefully cutting out an image from the magazine.\n\n \"That's cool,\" Clara chimes in. \"Structured pieces can be super versatile. They're more formal, sure, but you can always mix them with casual stuff to make it work.\"\n\n Ava leans over, holding a swatch of fabric toward you. \"Do you think this would fit with what you're doing?\"\n\n You take the fabric and run your fingers over it. It's a muted gray with a subtle pinstripe. \"Yeah, I think this would work,\" you nod.\n\n As you arrange the cutouts and fabric swatches on the poster board, you notice how your contributions add a grounding element to the collage. Jessica and Clara's bold choices bring energy and Ava's vibrant textures add flair. Your additions tie everything together with a subtle, structured edge.\n\n \"Wow, it's coming together really well,\" Jessica says, stepping back to admire the work.\n\n \"It's got a bit of everything,\" Clara agrees, clearly impressed. \"We can show this off.\"\n\n You can't help but feel a small spark of pride as you see how your contributions fit into your group's mood board. \n\n \n \n \n You find yourself drawn to the softer, more expressive designs scattered across the magazines and swatches. Flowing dresses, delicate patterns, and gentle pastel hues seem to leap off the pages. You begin cutting out the images and end up noticing how these styles evoke a sense of individuality.\n\n Jessica leans in, watching as you carefully extract a picture of a feminine top. \"That's an interesting pick,\" she says, tilting her head. \"You're going for something... whimsical?\"\n\n \"I suppose so, yeah,\" you respond, setting the image next to another of a flowing skirt. \"It just feels so effortless, I like it.\"\n\n Ava holds up a picture of a loose sweater in a peach color. \"Ooh, I think this would totally fit with what you're doing. It's cozy but stylish, if you know what I'm getting at.\"\n\n You nod, accepting the image and adding it to your collection. The pieces start forming a cohesive theme—one that celebrates softness. Clara picks up a swatch of pink chiffon and hands it to you.\n\n \"Here,\" she says. \"This seems like it'd go right with your vibe.\"\n\n As the group works together and arranges everything, your pieces add a sense of softness to the collage. The pastel tones and free-flowing lines balance out Jessica and Clara's bold choices and Ava's textural contributions.\n\n \"It's really pretty,\" Clara says, stepping back to admire the board. \"Like, it's calm, but still makes a statement.\"\n\n \"It's definitely got this peaceful but artistic vibe,\" Jessica nods in approval.\n\n You smile, brushing some stray cutouts to the side. You feel like your choices reflect a part of yourself you hadn't expressed much in the past.\n \n\nAs your group finishes the collage, Clara uses a sharpie to write a small title across the top: Expressions of Style. The board is a colorful mixture of textures and images, with each member's contributions weaving together into something cohesive but unique.\n\nSierra claps her hands to get everyone's attention. \"Alright everyone, time's up! Please leave your collages in the back, we'll be presenting them next class.\"\n\nAs your group sets the board aside, Sierra moves to the front of the room. \"To keep the creative energy going, we're going to be playing Style Story Showdown!\" she announces. \"Now, if you're asking what that is, I just made it up. But, how it works is that I have a basket filled with a bunch of fashion items. You'll pick an item blindly, and then you'll have a minute to tell us a story about a character who would wear that item. Be as wild and creative as you want!\"\n\nJessica has a hint of a sly smile playing on her lips. \"I'm not sure if anyone can top my fashion storytelling skills, though.\"\n\n\"Jessica, if you're so confident, feel free to go first,\" Sierra says, handing the basket to her.\n\nJessica reaches in and she pulls out a pair of oversized, glitter-encrusted sunglasses. She held them up, examining them like a prospector inspects minerals.\n\n\"Okay, I've got it,\" Jessica slips the glasses onto her nose. She tilts her head as if posing for a magazine cover. The lenses sparkle under the room's fluorescent lights, drawing every eye. \"Picture this: Sunset Goldstein, a pop star with a flair for drama. She just dropped her latest single, Disco Inferno Love, and it's hit a billion streams on every platform.\"\n\nJessica begins to pace the front of the room like she was on a stage, gesturing animatedly. \"But Sunset isn't just about music. Oh no, not at all. She's what some would call a visionary. And these glasses are her signature look. She wears them around everywhere she goes.\"\n\nYou can't help but smile, feeling like Sunset Goldstein is an actual person. \n\n\"Sunset doesn't just wear these glasses, she lives in them. Now, everyone wants a pair. She's an icon—the new queen of iconic eyewear.\"\n\nJessica strikes a final pose, hand on her hip, sunglasses glinting under the lights. \"Thank you,\" she says, flipping her hair before sitting back down with a triumphant smirk.\n\nThe room bursts in a mix of laughter and applause. \"Alright, Jessica,\" Sierra has a grin on her face despite her best efforts to maintain a neutral expression. \"Good job. That's going to be a tough act to follow, but we might just have the perfect second act! [name]!\"\n\nYour heart drops. You had to follow up that performance? Seriously? You hesitate before dipping your hand in the basket. Your fingers close around something soft and lacy, a pastel pink scarf with embroidered flowers.\n\n\"Let's see what you've got, [name].

This scarf was her favorite because it matched her rose bushes.\"\n\n A few heads nod and you feel your confidence build. \"Now that she's a ghost, she still roams the halls of the estate. But instead of hosting parties, she makes sure all the other ghosts' outfits are color-coordinated. She's like the fashion police of the afterlife.\"\n\n A few giggles ripple through the group, and you feel a bit more of the tension ease. Sierra claps her hands lightly.\n\n \"Nice one, [name]!\" Sierra says warmly, her smile making you feel a little better. \"You did a really good job.\"\n\n The rest of the club offers polite applause, and you let out a relieved breath as you pass the basket to the next person.

It's frilly, flowery, and nothing like you'd usually wear. But there's something about this room's energy that makes you decide to go big. If you're going to do this, you might as well own it.\n\n Standing up, you drape the scarf dramatically around your neck, letting it cascade down like you're modeling. With a deep bow and exaggerated flourish of your hand, you adopt a posh British accent.\n\n \"Ah, dearest guests of the illustrious Blossom Estate!\" you declare, sweeping an invisible crowd with a regal gaze. A few people lean forward and many begin giggling, boosting your confidence. You continue pacing the room as if addressing an audience at a grand ball. \"I am Lady Penelope Blossom, the eternal hostess of the most fabulous garden parties on this side of the afterlife!\"\n\n You pause dramatically, raising your hand as though to emphasize the importance of your words. \"This scarf is no mere accessory,\" you continue, tugging at the fabric around your neck. \"It is the crown jewel of my ensemble, hand-embroidered by only the finest artisans of the Victorian era. Some say it's enchanted—capable of making even the most dreadful fashion choices appear acceptable!\"\n\n The club laughs louder, Sierra clapping her hands together.\n\n You pause mid-step, holding up a finger as if suddenly struck by inspiration. \"However, this scarf does come with a curse!\" you add, lowering your voice. \"If someone dares to wear it without my explicit permission, they will find themselves unable to coordinate even the simplest of outfits for eternity! You'll find yourself wearing red and green!\"\n\n The laughter reaches a crescendo, and you finish with a dramatic bow. \"Now, my friends, I bid you adieu. For the afterlife waits, and the roses must be pruned.\"\n\n You sit back down, feeling the adrenaline coursing through you as the class erupts in applause. Sierra looks delighted.\n\n \"Okay, [name],\" Sierra says breathlessly. \"That was amazing! Lady Penelope would definitely approve of that performance.\"\n\n You can't help but feel a surge of pride—you didn't just participate, you stole the show.\n \n\nYou watch as the other members of the fashion club present, and as the last story wraps up, Sierra claps her hands. \"That was fantastic, everyone! You really brought your A-game today. I loved seeing how creative you could get. This is exactly the kind of energy we're aiming for here!\"\n\nThe room buzzed with chatter as members started to gather their things. You felt a mix of relief that the first meeting went so well.

Jessica, standing nearby, adjusts her bag and looks over at you with a smirk. \"You did really great, [name],\" she says. \"Lady Penelope and her ghost fashion empire, huh?\"\n\n\"Well, it was difficult to follow Sunset Goldstein,\" you reply. \"I did my best though.\"\n\n\"I'll see you in homeroom tomorrow, alright?\" Jessica says, slinging her bag over her shoulders. \"It was really nice seeing you here.\"\n\n\"Yeah, see you,\" you reply, watching as she strolls out of the room. As you grab your things and head out to lunch, you can't help but feel a little lighter. Maybe the fashion club isn't just about clothes and creativity. You feel it'll also be a chance to build connections and discover new sides of yourself. Today felt like a step forward, even if you're not quite sure where it'll lead.\n\n[Choice: Go to lunch]",

All the tools necessary for an afternoon's worth of drills.\n\n\"Alright, here's the game plan,\" Luke says. \"We're focusing on three things today: reaction time, agility, and tackling form. Don't go easy on me, [name], you're the assistant coach today.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" you reply, smirking. \"I plan to make you work for it.\"\n\n\"Good, let's get started then,\" Luke says, grabbing the football and jogging to the center of the field. \"For this one, you're going to toss the ball randomly in different directions. I'll sprint to catch it before it hits the ground. Don't make it too predictable—keep me guessing.\"\n\nYou take your spot a few yards away and begin tossing the ball, sometimes lobbing it high up into the air and other times throwing it low. Luke sprints, drives, and pivots, his cleats tearing into the turf as he moves.\n\n\"Is that all you got, [name]?\" Luke shouts after catching a difficult throw.\n\n\"Try this!\" you reply, sending the next ball wide to his left.\n\nThe drill pushes Luke to his limits, but as he warms up, you notice his reaction time becomes even quicker. Even his movements seem to get more precise as he adjusts to your unpredictable throws. After you finish up with the reaction time drill, Luke waves you over to the cones.\n\n\"Alright, now we're working on agility,\" he says, holding up the foam noodle with a grin. \"You're going to use this deadly weapon to try and tag me as I sprint through the cones. Your job is to block me or force me to change direction. My job is to make sure you miss.\"\n\nYou take your position as Luke crouches into a ready stance. He bursts into motion the moment you lunge, zigzagging through the cones.\n\n\"Too slow!\" he calls out, narrowly dodging your swing.\n\nYou adjust, trying to anticipate his next move, but his quick footwork keeps you on your toes. Eventually, you manage to tag your friend on the shoulder. \"Alright, alright, that was decent,\" Luke says, shaking his head and laughing. \"But you're going to have to be faster than that if you want to keep up with someone like me.\"\n\nAfter some more practice with the foam noodle, Luke picks up the padded tackling dummy, setting it in place a few yards back from the line of scrimmage. He kneels to adjust its position, shifting it around and making sure it's secure, before stepping back.\n\n\"This is the fun stuff,\" Luke says, cracking his knuckles with a loud pop. \"Tackling is all about form. Lowering the shoulder, keeping the legs driving, and following through. You can't just flail around and bump into someone. Watch and learn.\"\n\nHe lines up a few yards away, takes a deep breath, then bursts into motion. His feet pound against the grass as he closes the distance to the dummy. At the last second, he drops his shoulder, driving into the pad with so much force that it's knocked backward.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" Luke asks, adjusting the dummy. \"It's all about control. You're moving it, not just hitting it. Give it a try.\"\n\nYou step up and mimic your friend's stance. Your first attempt is clumsy, to say the least, but Luke steps in and gives you tips. With his guidance, you improve, eventually landing a solid hit that sends the dummy to the floor. Luke claps you on the back, congratulating you. By the time you finish the final drill, you're both winded, but there's a sense of accomplishment hanging in the air. The both of you made for a solid team, and you can't help but feel closer to him after today. You think about how you should respond to the training session.\n\n[Choice: Playfully tease Luke]\n[Choice: Challenge Luke for next time]\n[Choice: Thank him for including you]",

You'd have been lost without me keeping you on track.\"\n\n \"Oh, is that right?\" Luke asks, shaking his head as he turns to face you. He lets out a snort, his grin widening. \"From where I'm standing, you were the one out here sweating while trying to stop me with a foam noodle.\"\n\n \"I was breaking a sweat because I was actually trying,\" you chuckle. \"You're just lucky I didn't decide to start trying.\"\n\n \"Sure, coach,\" Luke laughs, his voice full with skepticism. \"Keep telling yourself that if it helps. Maybe next time I'll let you run the whole practice—you know, so I can sit back and critique your form.\"\n\n \"Deal, we're on,\" you reply, grinning. \"Don't cry when I show you up though.\"\n\n \"All bark and no bite, [name],\" Luke says, the laughter still lingering in his eyes. \n\n \n \n \n \"Alright, wide receiver,\" you say, planting your hands on your hips. \"Next time, let's turn this into an actual competition. Do you think you can keep up if I'm the one running the drills?\"\n\n \"You?\" Luke asks, his eyebrows arching. A smirk tugs at the corners of his mouth. \"Are you sure you even know the difference between a linebacker and a wide receiver?\"\n\n \"I'm serious!\" you say, laughing. \"If you think you're fast now, you should wait until I set the pace. I'll have you working harder than your coach does.\"\n\n \"Alright then, [name]. If you think you can handle it, I'm up for it. But don't cry when I end up leaving you in the dust.\"\n\n \"Come on, you and I both know I'll have you begging for water breaks before I even break a sweat.\"\n\n \"We'll see about that, Coach,\" he says. \"Next time, bring your A-game. You're going to need it.\"\n\n \n \n You wipe the sweat from your brow as Luke grabs the football and tosses it into the air absentmindedly. You watch him for just a moment, his focus still sharp even after the intense session. Instead of feeling drained though, you feel oddly accomplished.\n\n \"Hey,\" you say, breaking the quiet. Luke turns to you, raising an eyebrow. \"Thanks for letting me tag along. I wasn't sure what to expect, to be honest, but this was actually pretty fun. I'm glad you thought to include me.\"\n\n \"Huh, what do you mean?\" Luke asks. He blinks, caught off guard by the sincerity in your tone. \"You kept me sharp, kept the drills interesting. I invited you and you helped me more than I helped you. Plus, it's easier when it's someone who actually gives a shit, you know?\"\n\n \"Well, I'm glad to be that someone,\" you say, chuckling and taking a step toward him.\n\n \"Alright, [name],\" Luke says, a soft grin growing on his face. His eyes briefly meet yours before he tosses the ball to you. \"I don't want to get too sentimental but thanks. It's nice to have you out here.\"\n\n \"Aww, I knew you had a soft spot for me,\" you tease, catching the ball.\n\n \"Yeah, yeah,\" Luke laughs, shaking his head as he slings his bag over his shoulder. \"Don't let it get to your head.\"\n \n\nThe field fades behind you as you and Luke approach the nearby bench and vending machine. It's under the shade of a few tall trees, and the breeze carries a slight chill through the air. Luke tosses his bag onto the bench with a casual motion and cracks his neck.\n\n\"Man, I needed that,\" he says, his shirt drenched in sweat. \"Nothing beats a good workout.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's exhausting but the serotonin boost is nice,\" you say, smirking as you wipe your face.\n\n\"You've earned your break, Coach,\" Luke replies, laughing. He stops in front of the vending machine and looks around, reading all the labels. \"Let's see what they've got here.\"\n\nHe leans down, examining the brightly lit row of drinks inside. \"So you got your classic sports drinks,\" he says, gesturing toward some neon-colored bottles. \"They've got a ton of electrolytes and taste pretty good. Cool blue is the best flavor, by the way—don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\"\n\nHe moves his hand to the next row, pointing to the fizzy cans stacked neatly in their slots. \"Then there's some soda if you're feeling rebellious. Probably not what Coach would want me to drink, but hey, it's sugar and carbonation.\"\n\n\"And for the practical types, there's flavored water,\" Luke says, nodding toward a row of sleek bottles with trendy labels. \"It's classy, like hydration without the sugar rush.\"\n\nYou step forward, looking over the selection. The vending machine hums softly as you wonder what you should get.\n\n[Choice: Get a sports drink]\n[Choice: Get a soda]\n[Choice: Get a flavored water bottle]",

He pulls a crumbled bill from his pocket and slides it into the machine, punching the button for the drink with a practiced motion. The bottles clunk loudly into the bottom tray, and Luke bends down, grabs it, and tosses it to you with a grin. \"Here, Coach.\"\n\n You twist the cap off and take a sip, the cool, tangy flavor hitting just right after some exercise. Luke leans back against the bench, holding up his drink in a mock toast.\n\n \"To a hard day's work?\" you ask, holding up your bottle as well.\n\n \"To a hard day's work and good company,\" he replies.\n\n You clink your bottle lightly against his with a \n \n <<if [femininity] > 29>> \n giggle.\n \n \n chuckle.\n \n \n The moment feels easy, the refreshing drink a perfect cap to the effort the two of you put in. There's an underlying respect and warmth in Luke's tone that makes the day's work feel worth it.\n\n \n \n You glance at the fizzy row of drinks and point to a bright red can. \"Soda,\" you say with a grin.\n\n \"Soda after a workout?\" Luke asks, shaking his head as he fishes a crumpled bill from his pocket. He punches in the code for the soda, and the cans clunk into the tray below. He grabs it, tossing it over to you with a smirk. \"I'll enable your terrible choices just this once.\"\n\n You crack open the can, the sharp hiss of carbonation filling the air. Taking a long sip, you let out a sigh of satisfaction. \"Ah, the taste of rebellion feels good.\"\n\n \"Here's to terrible decisions,\" Luke says, raising his drink in a mock toast.\n\n \"Hear, hear,\" you say, clinking your can lightly against his. The familiar rhythm of your friendship makes the moment feel effortless.\n\n \n \n \"Flavored water,\" you say, pointing to the sleek bottle with a bright citrus label. \"I've got to stay hydrated and classy.\"\n\n \"Flavored water?\" Luke asks, raising his eyebrows. \"What, you too good for a regular sports drink?\"\n\n \"Are you calling me bougie for picking a drink I like?\" you joke. \"I have refined taste, you don't. Simple as that.\"\n\n \"Unbelievable,\" Luke shakes his head with an exaggerated sigh. He pulls out a crumpled bill from his pocket, punches in the code, and waits for the bottle to clunk into the tray. He grabs it, holds it up in mock reverence, and passes it to you. \"Here, Your Majesty. Your hydration awaits.\"\n\n You twist the cap off and take a sip, letting the cool, slightly sweet water slide down your throat. It hits perfectly after the workout, having a citrus zing to it. \"Not bad,\" you say with a smile.\n\n The two of you enjoy a quiet moment on the bench, both drinking your bottles of flavored water. The flavored water might not have been Luke's pick, but you can tell he doesn't mind. \n \n \"Thanks for sticking around today,\" Luke says, glancing at you. \"It's nice having someone out here who doesn't just talk about practice but actually shows up.\"\n\n \"Someone's got to keep you on your toes, don't you think?\" you ask, raising your bottle and meeting his gaze.\n\n \"Yeah,\" Luke replies, bumping his drink lightly against yours. \"Just don't get too used to me buying your fancy water, alright?\"\n\n \"Deal,\" you chuckle.\n\n The moment feels grounded and real, the kind of exchange that reminds you why you've been friends with Luke for so long. It's the little things—like a shared laugh over flavored water—that keep it all feeling effortless.\n \n\nThe sun dips lower on the horizon, casting long shadows across the football field. The faint rustling of leaves and distant sounds of the cheer squad fade into the background as you and Luke finish your drinks. The calm after the workout lingers, but as the breeze cools, Luke stretches his arms above his hands and stands up.\n\n\"Alright, Coach,\" he says, tossing the drink into a nearby trash can with a perfect arc. \"Don't you think it's about time we head home now? We've earned the break.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" you reply, nodding and brushing off your shorts. \"I'm pretty sure my legs will be super sore tomorrow.\"\n\n\"You'll be fine,\" Luke says, chuckling. \"Come on, let's take the shortcut through the woods. It's faster and we'll beat the traffic.\"\n\n\"The woods?\" you ask, glancing at the tree line. The dark foliage looks darker now in the fading light. \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Relax, I've been there a million times,\" Luke reassures, nudging your shoulder lightly. \"What, are you scared?\"\n\n[Choice: Go through the woods]\n[Choice: Take the usual route home]",

The crunch of autumn leaves beneath your shoes and the distant chirping of crickets fill the air, the shortcut already feeling quieter and more secluded than the busy parking lot.\n\n \"See?\" Luke says, gesturing around. \"Not so bad.\"\n\n \"It really isn't,\" you whisper.\n\n The air grows cooler as you and Luke walk deeper into the woods, the golden glow of the sunset filtering through the treetops.\n\n \"I told you this was faster,\" Luke says, glancing back at you and flashing an easy grin. \"We'll be home in no time.\"\n\n \"If we run into a pack of angry squirrels, I'm not saving you,\" you joke. \"I'll sacrifice you and get out of here alive.\"\n\n \"Noted,\" Luke replies. \"I'll rely on my wide receiver instincts to fend them off.\"\n\n The deeper you go, the darker it gets, the trees growing thicker and blocking out the last rays of sunlight. The air feels heavier here, cooler and tinged with an earthy scent.\n\n \"It's been a while since I came through here this late,\" Luke admits, his voice quieter now. He slows his pace, glancing around as he stuffs his hands into his pockets. \"It's a little scarier than I remembered it being.\"\n\n \"Yeah, no shit,\" you mutter, your gaze darting from tree to tree. \"Remind me again why this shortcut was a good idea?\"\n\n Luke opens his mouth to respond but the sound of a twig snapping in the distance makes both of you pause. \n\n \"It's fine,\" he says after a moment, his tone reassuring. \"There's nothing here but wildlife. Just stick close, and we'll be out soon.\"\n\n The path narrows further, forcing you to take each step carefully to avoid tripping over roots and rocks. Luke's footsteps are steady ahead of you, but the woods feel different now—quieter, almost unnervingly so. The occasional distant rustle of leaves and strange sound keep your nerves on edge.\n\n [Choice: Stick closely behind Luke]\n [Choice: Keep your distance]\n\n \n \"Yeah, I am scared of the woods,\" you reply to Luke. \"I'm fine taking our usual route home.\"\n\n \"Fine, whatever you say, Coach,\" Luke says, a grin on his face showing that he doesn't actually mind. \"We won't take any shortcuts, but if we hit traffic, I'm blaming you.\"\n\n The two of you walk away from the edge of the woods, heading toward the paved path that winds around the school campus. The late evening light stretches across the quiet sidewalks, casting long shadows from the rows of neatly trimmed bushes and lamp posts lining the path. The air is cooler now as it approaches night, and the faint hum of traffic from the nearby road blends with students wrapping up their after-school activities.\n\n \"Hey, it's better than being lost in the woods,\" you quip back.\n\n \"You're the only person taking a shortcut through the woods sound that dangerous,\" he chuckles, nudging you lightly with his elbow.\n\n The walk feels easy, the familiarity of the campus calming after the intensity of the field drills. Luke slows his pace slightly, tilting his head back to look at the sky.\n\n \"Man,\" Luke says after a moment. \"I don't think I actually took the time to appreciate how nice it is out here. I'm too busy running laps or dodging Coach's yelling at this time of day.\"\n\n \"Guess you're always moving too fast to notice,\" you say, falling into step beside him. \"It could help if you slowed down once in a while.\"\n\n \"Yeah, maybe,\" he replies, his tone lighter. \"But you know me—I don't exactly do 'slow.'\"\n\n The two of you pass the empty bleachers and the main parking lot, the occasional car pulling out and heading toward the main road. The chatter of a small group of students fades as they turn in the opposite direction, leaving the path ahead quieter.\n\n \"You ever think about stuff like this, [name]?\" Luke asks, his voice thoughtful. \"Like, all the little moments we don't pay attention to. How they just... slip by?\"\n\n You blink, surprised by the sudden shift in tone. It wasn't like Luke to suddenly bring something like this up. \"I mean, sometimes,\" you admit. \"But I guess that's why it's important to have people to share them with, right? Makes them stick a little more.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" Luke says, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. \"That makes sense.\"\n\n The rest of the walk feels quieter and more reflective, as the path takes you closer to the main road. The streetlights flicker on one by one, their warm glow guiding your way.\n\n [Choice: Tell him something positive]\n [Choice: Tell him he's overthinking things]",

The fading light filtering through the trees only makes the shadows stretch longer, creating strange shapes on the ground. There's a sense of unease creeping in, but Luke's steady presence in front of you reassures you.\n\n \"Yeah, sticking close seems like a solid plan,\" you say, trying to sound lighthearted. \"I'm sure we'll be fine.\"\n\n \"Relax, [name],\" Luke says, chuckling softly. \"Worst-case scenario, I'll carry you out of here. Just don't trip and fall.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, glad to have Luke's unshakable confidence even in the encroaching darkness. The trail narrows further though as you walk, forcing the two of you to walk single file. Every now and then, you have to step around roots or duck beneath low-hanging branches. The sound of your sneakers crunching against leaves and twigs echoes in the stillness, each snap and crackle feeling a lot louder than it should.\n\n \"You good?\" your friend asks, his voice quieter. He slows down slightly, waiting for you to match his pace.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you reply rather unconvincingly. \"Just trying not to trip.\"\n\n \"You'll be fine,\" he says, glancing back at you. His tone softens, and for a moment, there's something comforting about the way he says it.\n\n The trail twists suddenly, veering to the right. Luke pauses, looking ahead to check the path. You nearly bump into him but catch yourself, muttering some words of apology. The air feels heavier as you make your way to the edge of the woods. The trees seem to close in, their branches forming a canopy that blocks out the last of the fading sunlight. It's darker now, the faint glow of twilight barely reaching the forest floor. You stick closer to Luke, your steps almost matching his.\n\n \"It feels like we've been walking forever,\" you say, keeping your voice low.\n\n \"Yeah, these woods always feel longer when it's getting dark,\" Luke says, his voice as calm as ever. \"Trust me though, we're almost there.\n\n The faint rustling of leaves catches your attention, and you instinctively look toward the sound. Nothing's there. It was just the wind brushing through the leaves. You shake your head, trying to push down the creeping unease as you continue walking.\n\n \"Hey, you've been pretty quiet,\" Luke observes suddenly, breaking the silence. \"Are you alright?\"\n\n \"I'm just focused,\" you reply, quickening your pace so that the two of you are walking almost shoulder to shoulder.\n\n \"On what?\" Luke asks. \"I know it can be scary, but we'll be fine.\"\n\n \"You're right,\" you say, appreciative of his words. You open your mouth but quickly close it again as you see some light.\n\n The trail widens again, and ahead, you can see the faint glow of open space. Relief washes over you like a wave as the thick canopy gives way to the sight of the first streetlights marking the edge of the woods.\n\n \"There it is!\" Luke says, pointing toward the clearing. His pace quickens, and you follow close behind. Your footsteps feel light now that you can see the way out.\n \n \n As Luke leads the way, his confident strides creating a faint path through the woods, you decide to hang back, keeping a few paces between the two of you. The air is cooler here, the fading sunlight casting long shadows that stretch across the uneven trail. The sound of your footsteps crunching on leaves echoes faintly, punctuated by the occasional snap of a twig underfoot.\n\n \"You alright back there?\" Luke calls over his shoulder.\n\n \"Yeah, I'm good,\" you reply. \"I'm just making sure you don't lose me in this place.\"\n\n \"Don't worry, Coach,\" he says, chuckling softly. \"If we stick to the trail we'll be fine, I've got a flawless sense of direction.\"\n\n \"Flawless, sure we'll call it that,\" you joke, adjusting your pace to maintain the gap between you. \"You're lucky I trust you.\"\n\n The trail narrows slightly, forcing you to watch your footing carefully. Roots and rocks just out from the dirt, their twisted shapes catching what little light filters through the trees. The quiet feels heavier now, the distant sounds of the school and city muffled by the canopy above.\n\n \"This part's a little tricky,\" Luke says, pausing briefly. He carefully steps over a particularly large root, pointing to the uneven ground. \"Don't trip.\"\n\n \"Got it, I am pretty coordinated so, it'll be fine,\" you respond, a smirk on your face.\n\n The path twists sharply as you continue walking, and for a moment, Luke disappears from view. You quicken your pace slightly, the shadows ahead growing darker as the trees seem to close in.\n\n \"Luke?\" you call, your voice breaking the quiet. You glance from left to right, trying to find where the hell he went.\n\n \"Relax!\" you hear his voice say as he steps back into view. \"The trail's just winding a bit, I'm not ditching you.\"\n\n \"You scared me,\" you say with a nervous laugh. You fall back into your slower pace, although you do stick a little closer to Luke.\n\n The woods go quieter as the light fades, the air cooler and the scent of damp leaves stronger. You glance around occasionally, the rustling of branches keeping you on edge. Luke's steady pace and confident movements ahead are reassuring, even from a distance.\n\n \"We're almost there!\" Luke says after a few minutes. \"See that light up ahead? That's the edge of the woods.\"\n\n You follow his gaze and spot the faint glow of streetlights filtering through the trees. Relief washes over you, and you pick up your pace slightly, closing some of the distance between you and Luke.\n \n\n As you both step out of the woods, the air feels fresher, the faint hum of cars in the distance a welcome reminder of civilization. Luke stops at the edge of the path, glancing back toward the darkened woods with a small smirk.\n\n \"What did I say, the shortcut is faster,\" Luke says, turning to you.\n\n \"Yeah, not bad, if you're alright with getting lost in the woods, that is,\" you say, glad to be out of the woods. \"I'll stick to sidewalks next time.\"\n\n \"You may say that now, but when you're busy, it's a whole different matter.\"\n\n The two of you make your way toward the main road, the tension of earlier fading.\n\n \n \n <<if [lukeRomance] > 0>> \n \n \n \n \n \n You glance at Luke as you walk, the glow of the streetlights catching the edges of his face. There's an ease to the way he carries himself, his steps are confident but unhurried as if he's savoring the quiet moment.\n\n \"I'm glad we got to hang out today,\" you say, your tone soft but genuine. \"It's nice to actually spend time together.\"\n\n Luke's confident stride falters for a split second. He glances over at you,\n\n \"Yeah?\" he asks, his voice a little strained as if he's testing the words.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you reply. \"Feels like we don't get to do this much anymore. Just hanging out without a million things going on. I missed it.\"\n\n Luke looks ahead for a moment, his hand shifting to adjust the strap of his bag. When he speaks again, his voice is steady, but there's an undertone of something deeper. \"Me too. It's been a while, hasn't it?\"\n\n \"I suppose life gets in the way sometimes,\" you say. \"But today reminded me why we're friends in the first place.\"\n\n \"You really know how to hit someone in the feels,\" Luke chuckles softly, his gaze dropping to the pavement. \"For real, though, I'm glad too.\"\n\n \"Well, don't get used to me going easy on you,\" you say, trying to lighten the mood. \"Next time, I'm running the drills. They won't be easy either.\"\n\n \"We'll see about that,\" Luke says, letting out a light laugh. \"Don't get cocky.\"\n\n The warmth between you lingers as you approach the intersection of your neighborhoods, the quiet banter wrapping around you like the steady glow of the streetlights.\n \n \n You glance at Luke and smirk, nudging his arm lightly. \"Wow, listen to you,\" you begin. \"Getting all deep and philosophical. You're really overthinking this, aren't you.\"\n\n \"I don't overthink,\" Luke says, turning to face you with an exaggerated look of offense. \"I think you're confusing me with someone else, Coach.\"\n\n \"Sure, because you're known for casually pondering the fleeting nature of moments,\" you say, laughing.\n\n \"I'm allowed to think about stuff like that every now and then,\" he says, following after you. \"Doesn't mean I'm turning into some tortured poet.\"\n\n \"Could've fooled me,\" you quip. \"You know, in drama class, we're going to be doing a Shakespeare play. Maybe you can join. 'To tackle or not to tackle, that is the question.'\"\n\n Luke groans dramatically, covering his face with one hand as he catches up to you. \"You're the worst. I made one small comment and now I'm a philosopher.\"\n\n \"You said it, not me,\" you reply, grinning.\n\n \"Seriously though,\" Luke says after a moment, his voice softer but still carrying that edge of humor. \"It's not that deep. I just... I guess it's nice to have days like this, you know? Stuff that doesn't feel so... routine.\"\n\n \"I get it,\" you say, nodding. \"And don't worry—I won't let anyone find out you have feelings.\"\n\n \"Yeah, thanks, I guess,\" Luke says, shoving you slightly. \"Wouldn't want to ruin my stellar reputation.\"\n\n The first stars appear in the sky, the warmth of the moment making the walk feel a little shorter.\n \n \n\nLuke stops walking as the intersection between your neighborhoods comes into view. He looks at you, his smirk replaced by something softer and more thoughtful. \"Alright, Coach,\" he says, his tone lighter now. \"I suppose this is where we part ways. Are you sure you'll be able to survive the walk home without my expert guidance?\"\n\n\"I think I'll manage,\" you say, rolling your eyes. \"Thanks for the workout.\"\n\n\"Anytime,\" he replies, chuckling as he adjusts his bag. \"I'll see you in the morning tomorrow.\"\n\n\"For sure,\" you say.\n\nAs Luke turns to head toward the street, he glances back over his shoulder, flashing you a quick grin. \"Later, [name].\"\n\n\"Later,\" you reply, watching as he walks off. His silhouette fades into the glow of the streetlights.\n\nThe evening air feels a little cooler now, but a faint smile remains on your face as you head home.\n\n[Choice: Go home]",

The only clue to its purpose was a small, hand-drawn sign taped to the door: \"Occult Club - Enter If You Dare!\" You hesitate for a moment, wondering if you made the right choice.\n\nThe door to the Occult Club creaks as you push it open, revealing a dimly lit classroom. The windows are covered by thick, dark curtains, leaving the room bathed in the soft glow of candlelight. The air smells faintly of old books and incense. At the center of the room is a round wooden table, its surface covered in an assortment of strange items. Two chairs are already occupied, with a third that seems to be open for you.\n\nOne of them is Aurora, and she's dressed in her usual layered black attire. She looks up as you enter, her purple eyes staring deep into you.\n\n\"Hello, [name],\" Aurora says. \"Welcome to the Occult Club. I was hoping you'd show up.\"\n\nThe other student—a short boy with messy brown hair and glasses that are far too large for his face—looks up as well. He's surrounded by an explosion of notebooks, papers, and a half-eaten bar of chocolate. \"Oh! Hi! You're the new guy, right? [name]? I'm Milo!\" His words come out in a rush, and he gives a quick wave, knocking over a small stack of books in the process. \"Oops, sorry.\"\n\nAurora suppresses a small smile but gestures for you to take a seat at the table. You sit down, feeling the faint buzz of energy in the air.\n\n\"So, welcome to our small club,\" she begins, her voice calm. \"Officially, we're here to study folklore, myths, and the supernatural. Unofficially though, we know there's more to the world than what most people see. I'm sure you know.\"\n\nYou nod, Madame Serena's [referto] still fresh in your mind. \"Yeah, of course,\" you mutter. \"I've seen and experienced things.\"\n\n\"Ooh, like what?\" Milo leans forward, his eyes wide with curiosity. \"Is it ghosts? No, maybe interdimensional portals! They're super freaky, I've been reading about them.\"\n\n\"Milo,\" Aurora says gently but commandingly. \"Let [name] share what he wants to, alright?\"\n\nMilo sits back, fiddling with the edge of his notebook. \"Yeah, sorry.\"\n\n\"When we talked before, I could sense something different about you,\" Aurora whispers, leaning in slightly. \"If you're here, I'm assuming you're looking for answers. We might be able to help.\"\n\nShe slides a thin, leather-bound book toward you. Its cover is embossed with an intricate, swirling design. Milo immediately perks up upon seeing it.\n\n\"I love that book, it's one of my favorites!\" the words tumble out of his mouth. \"It's got all kinds of stuff in it—rituals, runes, even some stories about ancient curses! Make sure you don't skip the chapter on protective charms though.\"\n\nAurora shakes her head fondly. \"What Milo means is that we've got a lot of resources here. We're here to figure out what you need. Before we get started though, do you have a question? Only one though, we have a lot to do.\"\n\nYou glance between Aurora, with her calm expression, and Milo, who's bouncing in his seat. They're waiting for you to ask a question, and you realize this is your chance to start uncovering the secrets of magic.\n\n[Choice: What do you actually do in this club?]\n[Choice: Who is Milo?]\n[Choice: Is magic real for everyone?]",

      "text": "You lean forward slightly, glancing between Aurora and Milo. \"So what do you actually do in this club?\" you ask, curious.\n\n \"Good question,\" Aurora says, her lips curving into a small, knowing smile. \"Officially, we study the supernatural. Folklore, myths, urban legends, all that jazz. We analyze how these stories shape cultures and why they persist. It's academic enough that the school doesn't mind.\"\n\n \"But unofficially?\" Milo cuts in, practically vibrating with excitement. \"We experiment! We try a bunch of stuff. We test theories, draw protective sigils, and even do basic rituals. Aurora's really good at divination too!\"\n\n \"We're careful about what we do, [name],\" Aurora says. \"We don't mess with anything we don't fully understand. Magic is real, but it's also dangerous. We're here to learn and explore, not take unnecessary risks.\"\n\n Milo nods, his face suddenly turning serious. \"Yeah, I summoned a spirit once to find my earbuds after I lost them. It was a really bad idea, Aurora had to fix things.\"\n\n \"Well, it taught you a lesson, didn't it?\" Aurora sighs. \"We can't summon spirits for trivial things, Milo.\"\n\n \"Lesson learned, ma'am!\" Milo says brightly before turning back to you. \"But back to the point, we don't just sit around reading books. We explore, and sometimes, we actually get answers.\"\n\n \"It's also about understanding the boundaries of what's possible,\" Aurora nods. \"The supernatural isn't always obvious. It can be subtle. It's in the way coincidences happen, or the strange feeling you have when you step into certain places. The Occult Club is a space to notice those things and, maybe, figure out why they happen. There's a lot to learn here, and since you already know magic is real, you'll probably find more here than most.\"\n\n \n You glance at Milo, who's begun to doodle in the margins of his notebook. His energy is almost dizzying, and you can't help but wonder how someone like him ended up in the Occult Club. You turn to Aurora, lowering your voice slightly. \"So, who's this kid? Milo, right?\"\n\n \"Milo?\" Aurora asks, an amused smile on her face. \"He's our resident... enthusiast.\"\n\n Milo perks up immediately. \"That's me, enthusiast extraordinaire!\" he says, throwing his arms in the air. \"Oh, wait. Did you mean my story? It's a really good one, I promise. Full of mystery, intrigue, and more.\"\n\n \"Milo joined the club last year, and he's curious about everything,\" Aurora rolls her eyes fondly. \"He reads and studies a lot about magic. Sometimes he overdoes it.\"\n\n \"Hey!\" Milo interjects. \"I just like knowing stuff, alright? Like, there's a species of beetle that looks like it has runes on its back. Imagine if those were magic runes. Maybe magic came from those beetles, who knows?\"\n\n Aurora suppresses a laugh and continues. \"He's also really good at drawing sigils and deciphering old symbols. When focused, Milo is one of the best researchers I know. The issue is he's not focused very often.\"\n\n \"Well, I'm awesome anyway,\" Milo enthuses, a grin on his face. \"I'm here because magic is cool, and there's so much to learn about it. Plus, Aurora lets me talk as much as I'd like. Some clubs take an issue with that.\"\n\n \"You don't say,\" you mutter.\n\n \"Hey, I heard that!\"\n\n \"Milo's chaotic, but passionate,\" Aurora says. \"Feel free to ask him about anything, he'll be happy to answer. And that's Milo.\"\n\n You look at Milo again, watching as he furiously sketches something that looks suspiciously more like a cat than a rune. You can already tell that Milo will make this club interesting.\n\n \n You look between Aurora and Milo, the question swirling in your mind before you finally decide to ask. \"Is magic real for everyone? Or is it just something only a few people can do?\"\n\n Aurora's expression softens and she adjusts how she's sitting. \"That's a good question,\" she says, her voice calm and thoughtful. \"Magic is all around us—in the small things most people don't notice. But it's not something everyone can use.\"\n\n \"Yeah!\" Milo jumps in, practically bouncing in his seat. \"Like, everyone can feel magic sometimes, even if they don't realize it. You know when you get goosebumps for no reason or when you just know someone's watching you? That's magic. Kinda. Or intuition. Or both. Who knows?\"\n\n Aurora holds up a hand to calm Milo. \"What Milo's saying is that most people are capable of sensing magic, but only some have the potential to harness it. There's something unique about you, [name]. I've felt it for a while now. You've been touched by magic—maybe because of the spell, or maybe it's something that was always part of you. Either way, you have potential.\"\n\n \"Oh yeah, you're definitely not, like, average when it comes to magic vibes,\" Milo says. \"You have the spark! We could teach you stuff.\"\n\n \"If you want to explore your potential, this is the place to do it,\" Aurora continues. \"We can teach you how to sense magic more clearly, how to protect yourself, and—eventually—how to use it. But it takes time and patience. Remember that magic is a craft. It has rules.\"\n\n \"Rules are super important,\" Milo says, his tone unusually serious. \"Make sure you don't summon stuff unless you know how to send it back. Trust me on that.\"\n\n \"To answer your real question, [name], you can 'do' magic.\"\n\n The weight of her words settles over you. The idea of being able to use magic is thrilling, but you feel it also carries a sense of responsibility.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue with the Occult Club]",

      "text": "\"Alright, let's start with something simple,\" Aurora says, reaching into a box on the table and pulling out a clear quartz crystal. It gleams faintly under the warm light, its edges catching the glow like a prism. \"Energy sensing is one of the first skills any practitioner learns. It's subtle, but once you feel it, you'll always recognize it.\"\n\nShe sets the crystal on the table between the three of you and gestures toward it.\n\n\"The goal is to quiet your mind and focus on the crystal. Let your intuition take over. You might feel warmth, a vibration, or just a sense of awareness.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" Milo claps his hands together. \"I love this one! It took me forever to get it at first, but when I finally got it? It was awesome.\"\n\nMilo reaches out and places his hand near the crystal, squinting in concentration. \"Yup, I feel it! A little tingly, like I just got shocked by static electricity. Your turn, [name]!\"\n\n\"Make sure not to force it,\" Aurora says. \"Just relax and see what you notice.\"\n\nYou hesitate, glancing at the crystal. It's small, unassuming, but something about it feels alive. You reach out, hovering your hand over it. The moment your fingers are over the surface, something shifts.\n\nIt's subtle at first—a faint warmth spreading through your hand. But then it grows. The warmth turns into a pulse, like a heartbeat. A soft hum fils your ears, and a strange, electric sensation courses up your arm. The crystal glows brighter under your hand, as if its responding to you.\n\n\"Woah,\" Milo whispers, eyes wide. \"That's not normal, is it?\"\n\n\"[name], do you feel that?\" Aurora asks, her voice barely above a whisper. You see that her calm demeanor has cracked, her mouth slightly agape.\n\n\"I do, it feels strong,\" you say, struggling to find the words.\n\nThe pulse intensifies, its power undeniable. It's as if the crystal is drawing something from you—or giving something to you. You pull your hand back instinctively, and the sensation stops. The crystal dims but the energy in the air remains.\n\nAurora is silent for a long moment, her gaze fixed on the crystal as though expecting it to react again. She looks up at you, her expression a mix of awe and disbelief. \"[name], that wasn't just sensing energy,\" she says. \"You amplified it. That's not something you do on your first try.\"\n\n\"Amplified it?!\" Milo shouts, at you and then the crystal and then back at you. \"That's insane!\"\n\n\"The crystal resonated with your energy,\" Aurora takes a deep breath, not knowing quite how to take this. \"You have an incredible amount of potential. I don't think you understand how rare this is.\"\n\n\"Is that... bad?\" you ask, unsure if this newfound potential is something to fear.\n\n\"No, it's not bad,\" Aurora states. \"But it's powerful. If you want to explore this, you'll need to be careful—and you'll need guidance.\"\n\n\"Guidance?\" Milo asks. \"There's no need for that, [name]'s going to be the magic MVP! I mean, we've got to test this more, come on. Like, what else can you do? Can you—\"\n\n\"Milo,\" Aurora interrupts. She's gentle but firm, and Milo immediately closes his mouth. \"We need to take this slow. His power is raw, and until he learns to control it, we can't risk pushing too far.\"\n\nYou glance down at the crystal, its quiet surface now feeling like a doorway to something vast and unknown. The room is silent, the weight of your decision settling over you.\n\n[Choice: Let's keep going]\n[Choice: I need some time to think about this]",

She seems to weigh the risk of moving forward before giving a small nod. \"Alright,\" she says, nodding. \"We're going to take it slow though. No jumping into anything too advanced. This is about understanding what magic is. We don't want to push your limits.\"\n\n Milo pumps his fist in the air, practically vibrating with excitement. \"Yes, let's do this!\" he enthuses, picking up a notebook and a pen.\n\n \"Let's try this next,\" Aurora says, ignoring Milo's enthusiasm. She places a smooth, black stone on the table in front of you. \"This is obsidian, and it's often used for grounding and focusing energy. I want you to hold it this time and see if you can channel your focus into it.\"\n\n You reach out and pick up the stone, feeling its weight in your hand. The moment your skin touches it, you feel a subtle tug. It's something quiet and deep, not like the crystal's pulse. Closing your eyes, you concentrate.\n\n The tug grows stronger.\n\n You feel the energy inside you stir again, like a current waiting to flow. You instinctively guide it toward the stone, and within seconds, a faint warmth spreads through your palm. The stone begins to glow faintly, the light from its surface rippling like water.\n\n \"Woah,\" Milo breathes, leaning closer. \"It's glowing! Aurora, is it supposed to do that?\"\n \n \"Not usually, no,\" she says softly, voice laced with astonishment. \"[name], can you feel the flow of energy? Try to control it if you can.\"\n\n You focus harder, willing the warmth to stabilize. The glow intensifies for a moment, then steadies, casting rippling shadows across the table. The room feels charged, as though the air itself is holding its breath.\n\n \"Good, now let the energy return to you,\" Aurora says, her voice low. \"Don't force it—just let it flow back naturally.\"\n\n You follow her instructions, easing your focus. The warmth begins to recede and the obsidian's glow fades until it's just a normal stone. Your eyes flicker back open to find both Aurora and Milo staring at you, their expressions a mix of awe and disbelief.\n\n \"Incredible,\" Aurora says after a long pause. \"You didn't just sense the energy—you controlled it. That takes most people months to achieve at best.\"\n\n \"Months?!\" Milo jumps out of his seat. \"[name]'s doing this in minutes! You're a prodigy or something! Can we try another thing?\"\n\n \"That's enough for today, Milo,\" Aurora raises a hand to stop him. She turns to you, her usual calm demeanor crumbling. \"You've already done more than I expected. Pushing further would be dangerous, especially since this is your first time.\"\n\n \"Fine,\" Milo groans but doesn't argue. \"Next time though, I want [name] to go all out. I've got ideas!\"\n\n Aurora laughs and shakes her head. \"You've shown a lot of potential today, [name]. More than anyone in a long, long time. But this is just the beginning. You'll need patience and practice to explore your abilities.\"\n\n As the clock on the wall ticks closer to the end of the club block, Aurora starts gathering the objects and cleaning everything up. The curtains come off the windows, and the room returns to usual. Milo chatters on about theories and ideas, occasionally trying to coax you into learning to summon something.\n\n You lean back in your chair, the weight of what happened settling in. The crystal, the obsidian, the energy coursing through you—it felt natural. It felt like a part of you that had always been there but was only now waking up.\n\n When the bell rings, Aurora gives you a small smile. \"Great work today, [name],\" she says. \"Think about what you want to focus on next time. Make sure Milo doesn't pressure you into summoning anything.\"\n\n \"Hey, I would never do that!\" Milo protests.\n\n As you leave the room, you can't help but feel a spark of excitement. You feel that the Occult Club is a place where your potential, your power, can truly grow.\n\n \n You glance down at the crystal, its faint glow gone, and feel the lingering hum of energy in your fingertips. It's overwhelming—the power, the potential, the idea that you might have something inside you that could change everything. But instead of being excited, there's a weight in your chest, a nagging sense of unease.\n\n \"I think that's enough for today,\" you say, shaking your head. \"I need some time to process this. All of this.\"\n\n Aurora studies you carefully, her purple eyes searching your expression. She doesn't seem disappointed, and there's a flicker of understanding in her gaze. \"I understand,\" she says gently. \"It's a lot to take in. You've already done more than most people can on their first try.\"\n\n \"Aw, come on!\" Milo lets out a dramatic groan, throwing his arms up in the air. \"You were just getting started! Who knows what you can do? You can summon something like a...\"\n\n Milo catches Aurora's stern gaze and trails off.\n\n \"Milo, [name]'s made his decision,\" Aurora says, her voice calm but firm. \"This isn't about rushing. magic is personal, and everything needs to move at their own pace.\"\n\n \"Fine,\" Milo sighs and slumps back in his chair. \"But you're missing out on a lot.\"\n\n You can't help but chuckle at how dramatic Milo is being, though you're relieved at not pushing further. The energy you felt was thrilling, to say the least, but also unnerving. It felt like opening a door to something vast and unknowable.\n\n \"It's important to trust yourself, [name],\" Aurora says softly. She reaches across the table, picks up the crystal, and places it back into the box with care. \"If you feel like you're not ready, it's okay to take a step back. Magic isn't just about power—it's about control and understanding.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I had to start real slow!\" Milo says. \"It took me a week just to get the hang of sensing energy. Okay, maybe I messed up a bunch of times, but that's part of the process!\"\n\n The room falls into a comfortable silence as Aurora and Milo begin tidying up. They don't ask you for help, letting you mull over what happened. You watch the way Aurora carefully handles the magical objects and the way Milo bounces between tidying and making more of a mess. Despite their differences, there's an odd harmony between them.\n\n When the bell rings, signaling the end of the club block, Aurora looks at you. \"You've taken the first step, [name]. That's more than most people do. Don't underestimate just how important that is.\"\n\n Milo swings his bag over his shoulder and grins. \"Don't take too long to think things over! I've got a lot of plans, and they're gonna blow your mind.\"\n\n As you leave the room, the faint l lingers in your fingertips. It's a quiet reminder of the power resting inside you. You're not ready to dive in just yet, but you can't shake the feeling that this is only the beginning of something far bigger than you ever imagined.\n \n\n[Choice: Go to lunch]",

I was starting to think Luke's football cult had roped you in after all.\"\n\n\"Not a chance,\" you reply, smirking. \"I told you I'd come, didn't I?\"\n\n\"True,\" she says, pocketing her phone and straightening up. \"Alright, let's get going. This café's been all over my feed lately. If it's as good as everyone says, we might be in for a treat.\"\n\nThe walk to the café is easy, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows over the sidewalk. Samantha fills the silence with her usual mix of sarcasm and commentary on the people you pass. \"Did you see Jessica's outfit today? She somehow made that outfit work. I'm impressed, if I wore that, it would look so bad.\"\n\n\"Weren't you the one who said she can make anything work?\" you ask, chuckling.\n\n\"Hey, I stand by that,\" Samantha replies with a grin. \"It's just I didn't expect her to go and dress like it's still the 90s.\"\n\nWhen you arrive at the café, the place is buzzing and the air is filled with the rich aroma of coffee.

I've got to say I approve.\"\n\n When your drink arrives, it's as, if not more, over-the-top as you imagined. Layers upon layers of pastel colors topped with a swirl of glittery foam. As you sit down with Samantha, you notice a few people glancing your way, whispering about the drink.\n\n \"That thing is like, made for Insta,\" Samantha says, pulling out her phone. \"Hold still—I'm going to take a pic. You're going to be famous for this drink.\"\n\n The attention feels lighthearted and fun, and you enjoy having the spotlight, even if it is for your drink.\n\n \n You scan the menu, skipping past the flashy drinks and landing on something straightforward. \"Just a vanilla latte, please,\" you say to the barista.\n\n \"Classic choice,\" she replies, nodding as she rings up your order.\n\n \"Wow, bold choice, [name],\" Samantha jokes, nudging you as the two of you step away from the counter. \"Going with the most exciting drink on the menu, I can't imagine how that felt.\"\n\n \"Look, for coffee, simple is better,\" you reply, justifying your choice.\n\n When your drink arrives, it's exactly what you expected—no frills, just a delicious drink. You sit down with Samantha, and she shakes her head in mock disappointment. \"You're missing out on the glittery madness, but I suppose that's respectable.\"\n\n It's a quiet moment, nothing flashy, but you feel content with your choice.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \"What?\" you let out as you squint at the menu, reading some of the descriptions out loud. \"Unicorn Frappé? What the hell? Do they serve coffee here or just liquid art projects?\"\n\n Your voice carries just enough for a few people in line to hear. Samantha snorts, stifling a laugh behind her hand. \"Careful, [name]. You might get thrown out of the store for blasphemy.\"\n \n The barista raises an eyebrow but doesn't say anything, while a couple of other customers glance your way with faint disapproval on their faces. \n \n You shrug though, completely unaffected, and step up to the counter. \"Just a regular black coffee,\" you say, keeping it simple.\n\n When your drink arrives, Samantha is still smirking. \"You really leaned into the boomer vibe there,\" she says, laughing. \"Back in my day, coffee didn't have all these frills!\"\n\n You chuckle, but as you sit down, you've noticed that the cafe's atmosphere has changed. A few people are still giving you side-eyes, and Samantha seems more amused than impressed. The moment passes, but you feel your joke might not quite have landed like you'd intended it to.\n \n\nAfter your drinks arrive and you two get settled next to a window, you enjoy the warm afternoon sun. It streams in, painting the café in soft, warm hues of orange and yellow. Outside, the steady rhythm of passersby creates a backdrop of movement, while inside, the gentle clatter of mugs and conversation wraps the space in a cozy intimacy.\n\nSamantha takes a long, deliberate sip of her lavender honey latte, her brow furrowed in concentration as if she's judging a gourmet meal. After a moment, she places the cup down and leans back in her chair. \"It's good,\" she says with mock seriousness. \"Smooth and a little floral, but honestly? Not the life-changing experience I was promised. I'll give it an eight out of ten.\"\n\n\"You're not giving it a ten?\" you ask, smirking.\n\n\"Eh, nothing's a ten,\" she says, waving her hand dismissively. \"Tens are for life-altering moments. This is just... nice.\"\n\n\"That's fair,\" you reply, leaning back in your chair as your gaze drifts to the window.\n\nFor some time, the conversation settles into an easy quiet, both of you taking in the scenery. Samantha breaks her silence after a minute or two, tapping her fingers lightly on the table. \"So,\" she starts, her tone casual but with a hint of genuine curiosity. \"What's it like hanging out somewhere that doesn't involve Luke yelling about football or someone trying to knock you over? Nice, right?\"\n\n\"Come on, it's not like I'm with Luke all the time,\" you reply, a grin on your face.\n\n\"Come on, you've got to admit it—this is better. You don't have to run laps or deal with sweaty guys, just good coffee and me. Pretty unbeatable combo, if I do say so myself.\"\n\nHer teasing tone is familiar, but there's something softer behind it.\n\n\"But seriously, how have you been?\" she asks, her voice dropping. \"You've been busy lately—clubs, school, life. I feel I don't see you nearly as much as I used to, and I kinda miss having someone to make fun of.\"\n\nThe shift in her tone is subtle but unmistakable. Samantha's usual sarcasm seems to fall away for a moment, leaving her open.

It's nice to just... take a break.\"\n\n For a moment, Samantha doesn't respond. She's watching you closely, her usual sarcasm replaced with something softer. Then, she leans back in her chair, her grin returning. \"Lucky for you, I'm a world-class distraction. Consider this your break from the chaos.\"\n\n \"It's the best distraction I've had in a while,\" you reply.\n\n \"And seriously, [name], if it ever feels like too much, you know you can talk to me, don't you?\" she asks, pointing her spoon at you. \"I'll even let you rant for free.\"\n\n \"That's generous of you,\" you laugh.\n\n \"Hey, I have my moments,\" she says. \"Anyway, enough with the doom spiral. Did I tell you about what Puke did when he called me yesterday?\"\n\n The weight of the earlier conversation starts to lift as she continues talking. The blend of Samantha's wit and her genuine care makes the moment feel lighter, even as her words about being there for you linger in your mind.\n\n \n \n \"Well, with how busy I've been, you're lucky to be so high on my priority list,\" you say, leaning back in your chair and letting a small grin tug at the corners of your mouth. \"Not everyone gets the privilege of enjoying a coffee with me, you know.\"\n\n \"Oh, is that so?\" Samantha asks, her voice dripping with mock indignation. \"I should feel honored, huh? Mr. Young Socialite took time out of his packed schedule to grace me with his presence?\"\n\n \"Exactly,\" you say, chuckling. \"You really should start appreciating me more. It's not every day I bless someone with my company.\"\n\n \"Wow, someone's ego got a boost today,\" she says, laughing. \"Did someone give you a pep talk about how you're special?\"\n\n \"Just being around you inspires me,\" you say with an exaggeratedly sincere tone.\n\n \"Okay, dial it back,\" Samantha rolls her eyes but can't hide the faint blush creeping onto her cheeks. \"You're laying it on way too thick.\"\n\n \"But it's working, no?\" you tease.\n\n \"I'll admit that it's mildly entertaining,\" she says, pointing her spoon at you. \"Emphasis on mildly.\"\n \n The banter flows effortlessly, the energy between the two of you light and playful. Samantha seems to relax even more, the usual sharpness of her sarcasm softening into something warmer, more comfortable. The conversation shifts naturally to other topics, but there's a new undercurrent to the moment. You can't help but notice the way Samantha's grin lingers a little longer, or the way her tone softens slightly when she teases you. Whatever this is, it feels good.\n\n \n \"It's not too bad,\" you say, keeping your tone casual as you lean back in your chair. \"Yeah, the clubs and school stuff keep me busy, but it's nice to have something going on, you know? It keeps things interesting.\"\n\n \"So you're saying juggling all the shit you have to get done doesn't bother you?\" Samantha asks, swirling her latte thoughtfully. \"If it were me, I'd be stress-eating like crazy.\"\n\n \"Nah, I got it under control,\" you chuckle, shaking your head. \"Besides, I know you'd call me out if I slacked on my friend duties.\"\n\n \"Oh, you better believe I would,\" she says, a grin returning to her face. \"I'd write a strongly worded text and everything. You'd be horrified.\"\n\n The tension in her earlier question melts away, replaced by the usual banter that feels like second nature between you two. Samantha rolls her eyes playfully but seems satisfied with your answer, her sarcasm picking up right where it left off.\n \n\nThe last remnants of your drinks sit forgotten on the table as you and Samantha linger in the café's warm atmosphere. Samantha stretches her arms over her head, letting out a satisfied sigh. \"Alright, I'll admit it,\" she says. \"This was a pretty solid way to spend an afternoon. Even if I'm still bitter about this coffee not being a perfect ten.\"\n\n\"You really have high standards for coffee,\" you reply.\n\n\"For everything,\" she corrects. \"Someone's got to keep this world from falling into mediocrity.\"\n\nYou chuckle, watching as she pulls her bag from the back of her chair. The café has thinned out a bit, and the soft golden light outside hints at the day slipping into evening.\n\n\"So, what's the plan now?\" Samantha asks as the two of you stand to leave. \"Should we hang out a little longer?\"\n\nThe two of you step out into the crisp air, the sounds of the bustling street filling the space around you. Samantha pauses, glancing toward the nearby shops.\n\n\"Okay, real talk,\" she says. \"We could call it a day and head home, or we could go do something fun. You in?\"\n\n[Choice: Walk around the shops]\n[Choice: Call it a day]",

A few people stroll past, carrying bags or chatting quietly, giving the atmosphere a relaxed vibe. \"You know, why don't we check out the shops?\" you say, turning back to Samantha. \"A little window shopping never hurt anyone, did it?\"\n\n Samantha grins, adjusting her bag on her shoulder. \"Finally, a good idea. Let's see what overpriced nonsense we can find to make fun of.\"\n\n The two of you start walking down the street, falling into an easy rhythm. Samantha immediately points out a clothing store with mannequins dressed in overly dramatic and mismatched outfits. \"Check this out, [name]!\" she says, gesturing to a mannequin in a gown paired with chunky sneakers. \"A gown with sneakers? It's like they dressed for a ball and then remembered they had to catch the bus.\"\n\n \"Hey, it's a bold choice,\" you say, laughing. \"Maybe they're onto something that we just don't understand yet.\"\n\n \"Yeah, onto being the weirdest person in the room,\" Samantha mutters.\n\n You keep walking, pausing to peer into a bookshop window where an elaborate display of bestsellers is stacked. Samantha reads the blurb on one of the covers, her voice dripping with sarcasm. \"Look at this. 'In a world not unlike our own, a young man embarks on a journey of self-discovery, facing unexpected challenges and ultimately learning valuable life lessons about courage, friendship, and the importance of finding one's true purpose.' Wow, that's never been done before.\"\n\n \"It could be good,\" you say with a grin.\n\n \"I'm good,\" she replies. \"You can buy it if you want and tell me if it's good.\"\n\n As you stroll past a quirky gift shop, Samantha stops abruptly, her eyes lighting up. \"Come on, we have to go in there,\" she says. You follow her inside, the smell of candles and the faint sound of indie music filling the air. Samantha immediately picks up a mug that looks like a cat curled into a ball. \"This is so stupid, but I kind of want it.\"\n\n \"Why not buy it?\" you ask.\n\n \"Come on, I can't be the person who drinks out of a ceramic cat.\"\n\n The two of you wander the aisles, occasionally picking up random items and making jokes about their impracticality. You go through novelty mugs, fake plants, and blocky spheres.\n\n [Choice: Buy Samantha the cat mug as a surprise]\n [Choice: Point out something that suits her perfectly]\n [Choice: Tease her about buying the cat mug]\n\n \n You pause for a moment, glancing down the street at the fading sunlight and the slowly shifting shadows of the evening. The weight of the day and everything you still need to do starts to creep back into your thoughts.\n\n \"Honestly, I should probably head home,\" you say, turning back to Samantha. \"I've got a lot to catch up on, and if I don't start now, it's just going to pile up.\"\n\n Samantha raises an eyebrow, her lips quirking into a teasing smirk. \"Look at you, being all responsible. Who are you, and what have you done with the real [name]?\"\n\n \"Hey, I have my moments,\" you say, chuckling. \"But seriously, thanks for dragging me out. I needed this.\"\n\n \"Yeah, well, I figured someone had to make sure you were still alive.\"\n\n \"Mission accomplished,\" you reply, a goofy grin on your face.\n\n \"Alright, fine, go be productive,\" she says, laughing. \"But don't let this become a habit, alright? And if you crash and burn halfway through your homework, just remember—it's not my fault you didn't want to hang out more.\"\n\n \"Alright, alright,\" you laugh and shake your head as she turns and heads off down the street, her sarcasm trailing behind her like an echo. The moment feels lighter than you expected, her usual teasing balanced out by her sincerity.\n\n As you make your way home, the noise of the day seems quieter, and the stress of everything you have to do is a little less heavy. Spending time with Samantha reminded you why it's worth making space for moments like these, even when life feels overwhelming.\n\n [Choice: Go home]",

      "text": "<<if [money] > 4>> \n \n \n As Samantha lingers near a display of scented candles, distracted by a flowery scent, you glance toward the shelf where she left the cat mug. Without hesitation, you quietly double back, picking it up and heading to the counter. The cashier rings it up with a knowing smile, saying nothing but glancing over at Samantha, who's oblivious to what's happening. You quickly tuck the small bag behind your back as you rejoin her, catching her mid-ramble about how none of the candles smell good.\n\n \"Ready to go?\" you ask, keeping your tone casual.\n\n \"Yeah, I am,\" she says, rolling her eyes and grabbing her bag. \"This place is fun, sure, but I swear half of it is designed to give you buyer's remorse.\"\n\n You step outside, the cool air a welcome contrast to the cozy, slightly overwhelming vibe of the shop. As the two of you walk a few steps, you pull the small bag from behind your back.\n\n \"Hey,\" you say, holding it out to her.\n\n \"What's this?\" she asks, turning and furrowing her brows in confusion.\n\n \"Just a little something for you,\" you reply, grinning.\n\n Samantha takes the bag cautiously, her expression skeptical as she pulls out the cat mug. For a moment, she just stares at it, her lips twitching like she's trying to decide how to react.\n\n \"You didn't,\" she says, her voice softer than usual.\n\n \"I just did,\" you reply, shrugging. \"You were obviously into it, come on now. Figured it might brighten up your mornings.\"\n\n \"This is ridiculous,\" Samantha says, letting out a laugh and shaking her head as she holds up the mug. A faint blush creeps up her cheeks as she observes the cat.\n\n \"But you love it,\" you tease.\n\n \"Maybe a little,\" she admits, tucking the mug back into the bag carefully. \"Alright, fine, you win this round,\" Samantha says. \"But don't think this makes you some gift-giving genius, alright?\"\n\n \"Sure,\" you reply.\n\n Samantha nudges you lightly with her elbow as you start walking again. \"Thanks, by the way, it's cute.\"\n \n The gesture shifts the dynamic between you slightly—not enough to feel awkward, but just enough to make the moment feel special. Samantha's usual sarcasm hasn't disappeared, but the warmth in her voice and the way she glances at the bag every so often tells you that she appreciates it more than she's letting on. As the two of you continue down the street, you notice her carrying the bag a little more carefully, as if it means more to her than she'd ever admit out loud.\n \n \n You check your balance and realize you don't have enough money to buy Samantha the cat mug. You sigh and shake your head, turning your gaze away from the adorable feline.\n \n\n \n As Samantha browses the shelves, picking up random items and making sarcastic comments, your eyes land on a quirky journal tucked near the display of novelty items. The cover reads in bold, gold-embossed letters: \"Things I Pretend to Care About.\"\n\n \"This has your name written all over it,\" you say, grinning as you show it to her.\n\n \"Oh, come on,\" Samantha says as she spots the journal. \"Are you trying to sell me something, [name]?\"\n\n \"It just feels very... you,\" you reply, smirking. \"I mean, think about it—you could fill it with all the annoying trends you mock, classes at school, your sarcastic takes on life. It's perfect.\"\n\n She flips through the blank pages, her smirk widening. \"Alright, I'll admit it—it's kind of amazing. But I feel like buying this would be admitting I don't care about anything. That's not true, obviously, I care deeply about the stuff that really matters in life. Like making fun of you and Puke.\"\n\n \"See, that'll be a place to document all that wisdom,\" you say, nodding. \"Think about the material you could save for later.\"\n\n \"You're not wrong,\" she says after spending a few moments holding the journal up and weighing her options. \"This could be useful. Fine, you know what, you win this round. But if I start actually using this thing, I'm blaming you.\"\n\n \"Happy to help,\" you say, chuckling.\n\n As you both head toward the register, she holds the journal up again, shaking her head. \"You know, maybe you should be my personal shopper once I'm rich.\"\n\n \"In your dreams,\" you say.\n\n When she pays for the journal and steps back outside with you, the late afternoon sun catches the faint smile still lingering on her face. She glances at you, holding up the bag with the journal inside. \"Thanks for pointing it out, by the way. You might actually know me better than I thought.\"\n\n The moment feels light but meaningful, and you're glad this connection means something to the both of you.\n\n \n As you and Samantha step out of the gift shop, you gesture back toward the display of novelty mugs. \"You sure you don't want it?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow. \"I can totally see you sipping tea out of that cat mug while judging everyone in class. You'd be an icon.\"\n\n \"Not happening,\" Samantha says, rolling her eyes. \"I have standards, thank you very much.\"\n\n \"Do you, though?\" you tease, leaning slightly closer. \"I mean, you did spend way too much time looking at it.\"\n\n \"Excuse me?\" Samantha pauses mid-step and turns to face you. \"I was analyzing it. There's a difference, thank you very much.\"\n\n \"Oh, sure,\" you reply, laughing. \"Analyzing whether it'd ruin your carefully curated vibe, right?\"\n\n \"You're impossible,\" Samantha says, shaking her head and giggling.\n\n The banter flows easily between you, her laughter punctuating the steady rhythm of your steps as you stroll down the street. The teasing is light and familiar, the kind of exchange you can only have once you know someone well. By the time you reach the next block, the moment with the cat mug has become just another funny story. \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

The air smells faintly of ink and paper, and the faint hum of a printer lingers in the background.\n\nA group of students have already gathered near the front of the room, chatting amongst themselves. You scan the club room, and your eyes land on Jordan, the school's star football player. He's off to the side, leaning casually against a desk with his arms crossed. He looks completely out of place, his athletic stance a stark contrast to the more artsy vibe of the rest of the club.\n\nJordan glances up and meets your eyes for a moment before looking away, his expression unreadable. He's certainly aware of your presence, but you get the sense he's not going to acknowledge it.\n\nAt the center of the group stands a girl with short, choppy hair dyed a shade of light green. She's wearing a black turtleneck and has a pair of round glasses on. She has a clipboard in her hands and flips through some papers as she talks.\n\n\"Alright everyone, let's get started,\" she says, her voice warm but no-nonsense. \"Welcome to the Yearbook Club. For those of those who don't know me, I'm Charlotte, your fearless leader and editor-in-chief of this operation.\"\n\nCharlotte looks around the room, her eyes scanning the group. When her gaze lands on you and a few other faces, she pauses briefly, her brow furrowing in curiosity. \"Looks like we've got a few new faces this year, which is great. We can use all the help we can get. The yearbook is a reflection of the entire school, and it's our job to make sure it tells a story. We can't just slap some pictures together and call it a day.\"\n\nThere's a murmur of agreement from the group, though Jordan remains silent.\n\nCharlotte lets the room quiet down before clapping, drawing everyone's attention back to her. \"Now, before we dive into brainstorming themes, layouts, and all that fun stuff, let's do some quick introductions,\" she says. \"Just your name, why you joined the club, and what you hope to bring to the yearbook this year!\"\n\nShe gestures to a boy sitting nearby, who introduces himself as Simon. He talks about his love of photography. The introductions move around the room, each person sharing their interests. When it's Jordan's turn, he straightens up slightly, sliding his phone into his pocket.\n\n\"Jordan,\" he says simply, his tone as flat as can be. \"Coach made me join. He said I needed to 'diversify my extracurriculars' or something.\"\n\n\"Well, we're glad to have you Jordan,\" Charlotte says politely, although you can tell she's a little worried. \"I'm sure you'll bring a unique perspective to the team.\"\n\nFinally, your turn arrives. Charlotte looks at you expectantly, clipboard in hand, ready to write something down. The room quiets, waiting to hear what you have to say.

I like working on projects, so I thought I'd give it a shot.\"\n\n Charlotte nods, jotting something down on her clipboard. \"Good to have you, [name],\" she says with a welcoming smile. \"We're always looking for people who aren't afraid to try something new.\"\n\n Jordan glances at you briefly, his expression unreadable, but you catch the faintest flicker of curiosity in his eyes before he looks away again.\n\n \n \n \n You lean forward slightly, a smirk playing on your lips as you speak. \"I'm [name], and I'm here because yearbooks are obviously the most exciting thing in high school,\" you say, your voice dripping with playful sarcasm. \"Who doesn't want to spend hours choosing fonts and arranging pictures?

You're not sure if he liked or disliked your introduction, but you've at least caught his attention.\n \n\nCharlotte signals it's time to move on after everyone finishes introducing themselves. She claps her hands, her green hair bouncing slightly as she shifts her focus back to the group. \"Alright, now that we've got the introductions out of the way, let's talk about themes,\" she says, a bright smile on her face. \"The yearbook isn't just a random collection of pages—it's a reflection of the year, the vibe of the school, and the people in it.\"\n\nShe pulls out a thick binder, plopping it onto the table with a thud. The cover reads Yearbook Club in handwritten letters. \"This binder has a bunch of stuff from the last ten years of Pacific Crest's Yearbook Club,\" Charlotte explains. \"Most importantly for today's club meeting, it has the past themes! It's good for inspiration and making sure we don't copy a past yearbook. Make sure to think big—what kind of story do we want to tell about this year?\"\n\nThe group leans in, murmuring ideas and pointing at the binder. \"What about something futuristic?\" Simon suggests. \"Like '2025: A School Odyssey' or something?\"\n\n\"Futuristic sounds cool,\" Charlotte agrees, jotting it down. \"Let's keep brainstorming. Any other ideas?\"\n\nJordan, who hasn't muttered a single word thus far, suddenly speaks up. \"What about something simple?\" he suggests. \"We don't need any gimmicks, just a theme that highlights the students and focuses on the people.\"\n\n\"Like a focus on portraits and personal stories?\" Charlotte asks, nodding thoughtfully.\n\nYou sit back, listening as the ideas flow. Some suggest vibrant, colorful themes, while others lean toward minimalist concepts. Charlotte writes down every suggestion, nodding and occasionally adding her own thoughts.\n\n\"Alright, we've got a solid list of ideas here,\" Charlotte says after twenty minutes. \"Let's see where everyone fits in and what role you all will have. Photography, design, writing, editing, and more. There's a ton that goes into a yearbook, and we need to know what everyone's strengths are.\"\n\nShe divides the room into smaller groups, and you end up in a design-focused group with Jordan and Simon. Charlotte hands out sheets of paper and some markers. \"This is a quick exercise,\" she explains. \"I want you to come up with a mock layout for a two-page spread. Imagine this is for the theme we just brainstormed. Just make it creative, it doesn't need to be perfect or anything.\"\n\n\"I'm not much of an artist,\" Jordan mutters, crossing his arms.\n\nSimon rolls his eyes playfully. \"It's just an exercise. Nobody's going to judge if you draw stick figures.\"\n\n\"Alright, what if this page had a big story in the middle, and we framed it with smaller pictures and quotes?\" you suggest, picking up a marker.\n\n\"That could work,\" Jordan shrugs. \"Maybe add a border to tie it into the team.\"\n\nSimon nods enthusiastically, sketching a few lines. \"Over here, we could have a section for candid photos or interviews.\"\n\nThe three of you bounce ideas back and forth, and unexpectedly, even Jordan gets into it. By the time Charlotte walks over to check on your progress, your page has a surprisingly polished look.\n\n\"This looks awesome,\" Charlotte says, her eyes lighting up as she examines what the three of you created. \"Great work, I can already tell this is going to be a strong yearbook team.\"\n\nCharlotte steps back once she finishes checking on everyone and addresses the entire room. \"Awesome work, everyone!\" she enthuses. \"These layouts are a great start, and I'm getting an idea of how to structure the final yearbook already. Next time, we'll refine these concepts and start assigning specific pages to different teams.\"\n\nThe group murmurs in agreement, as everyone begins to tidy up their workspace.\n\n\"But I also want to do another activity,\" Charlotte continues, holding up a sketch of papers. \"Since this is Yearbook Club, it's only fitting that we include a section about us in the yearbook! The team that made it all happen! So, as a quick exercise, we're going to make personal profiles.\"\n\nShe starts handing out sheets of paper, each one printed with prompts.\n\n\"Think of this as a little snapshot of who you are,\" Charlotte explains. \"Not only will it help us get to know each other better, it'll serve as nice practice about how to tell other people's stories in the yearbook.\"\n\n\"This is a cute idea,\" Simon says, picking up his sheet with a smile. \"I love these kind of prompts.\"\n\n\"I joined the football team to escape these,\" Jordan mutters, eyeing the sheet warily.\n\nAs you tap your pen against the desk as you glance over the questions, thinking about how to represent yourself. The room hums with the sound of scribbling pens and quiet chatter. When you glance over at Jordan, you see him frowning at his paper like it's a math test.\n\nThis small, reflective task is quiet and introspective. It's a moment to think about how you want to come across not just to the group but to anyone flipping through the yearbook next year.\n\n[Choice: Lean in a softer, more expressive style]\n[Choice: Lean in a stronger, more confident style]",

I can tell you're going to bring a lot of heart to the club.\"\n\n \n \n \n You glance at the sheet, reading through the prompts again. The words \"three words to describe yourself\" catch your attention first. You think carefully, tapping your pen against the table.\n\n Finally, you write: determined, focused, ambitious. They're not flashy, but they feel like the right words. The kind of image you want to project.\n\n Next is the prompt \"favorite school memory\". You hesitate for a moment, then jot down something that shows your competitive side: Winning the relay race during last year's track meet. It's straightforward but says a lot about what you value.\n\n For \"dream job,\" you write something bold and aspirational: CEO of a tech company. It shows that you aim high, which is nice.\n\n The prompt \"why you joined the Yearbook Club\" makes you pause. You want to keep the tone consistent, so you write: To challenge me with something new and contribute to the school.\n\n You finish up and place the paper down. When Charlotte comes to collect the sheets, she smiles as she glances at what you wrote. \"It looks like you've got a clear vision of who you are, [name]. That's good.\"\n \n\nAs the hum of conversation fades and Charlotte finishes collecting the personal profiles, she moves back to the front of the room with her clipboard in hand. She taps the stack of papers on her desk lightly, drawing everyone's attention.\n\n\"Alright, awesome work on these profiles,\" Charlotte says. \"I'll go through these later to get a sense of everyone's vibe. But before we wrap up, there's one last thing we need to tackle for today. We're going to be choosing the theme for this year's yearbook!\"\n\nThe room stirs with quiet excitement. Simon sits forward eagerly while Jordan leans back, looking indifferent.\n\n\"We had some amazing suggestions but I've narrowed it down to three strong contenders based on what you all shared earlier. Let's take a quick vote to decide. Remember, the theme will shape how we design, organize, and tell the story of this school year!\"\n\nShe writes down the three options on the whiteboard at the front of the room.\n\n<ol> \n <li>A School Odyssey</li>\n A futuristic theme with sleek, digital-inspired layouts and a focus on forward-thinking.\n <li>Through the Lens</li>\n A photography-driven theme highlighting candid moments and personal stories of students and staff.\n <li>Timeless Traditions</li>\n A nostalgic theme celebrating the school's history, traditions, and the moments that define the year.\n</ol> \n\nCharlotte turns back to the group. \"Take a minute to think and then write down your choice on these slips of paper. We'll tally the votes anonymously.\"\n\nAs the slips make their way to you, you weigh your options.\n\n[Choice: Choose A School Odyssey]\n[Choice: Choose Through the Lens]\n[Choice: Choose Timeless Traditions]",

You take your usual seat in the back, gently placing your bag on the floor and pulling your phone out of your pocket. Around you, the chatter of classmates fills the air—a blend of sleepy murmurs and animated conversations.\n\nJessica sits in the seat next to you, her long blonde hair cascading over her shoulders as she leans back in her seat. Even this early, she looks camera-ready, her glossy nails tapping against her phone screen.\n\n\"No, I know,\" she says on the phone, her voice carrying just enough to be heard over the general hum of the room. \"It's the worst timing ever. Like, the game is literally tomorrow, and we're still down a cheerleader.\"\n\nYou glance up, pretending to be focused on your phone while keeping one ear trained on the conversation.\n\n\"Yeah, Mandy moved to Iowa, I told you,\" Jessica continues, her perfectly manicured fingers twisting a strand of her hair absentmindedly. \"The routine's already a mess because of that. Coach is freaking out, and I can't blame her. We can't do a pyramid with one person missing. It's just—ugh.\"\n\nShe pauses, nodding as if the person on the other end can see her. \"I mean, sure, I guess we could rework it, but that's going to take forever, and we've already practiced this routine a million times. We don't really have time for this.\"\n\nShe falls quiet for a moment, listening to what the other person is saying. Then, with a practiced flick of her hair, she says, \"I know, yeah. I'll talk to Coach after class and see if she has any ideas, but unless someone magically volunteers today, we're gonna have to go out there with a busted routine. It's going to be so embarrassing.\"\n\nShe ends the call with a soft sigh, setting her phone down on the desk and staring out the window. Despite her frustration, there's not even a hint of malice in her tone—it's clear she cares about the team and wants the routine to succeed, but she's caught in a situation she can't control.\n\nAs the bell rings to start homeroom, Jessica shifts in her seat and glances around the classroom, her usual bright, social smile not appearing. For a moment, you wonder what it must be like to juggle all the expectations of someone like her—the pressure to always have it together.\n\nYou return your focus to your phone, but her words linger in your mind.\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

This period will be free time. Use it to catch up on homework, read, or whatever you need to do.\"\n\nA ripple of murmurs and rustling echoes through the room as students take out books, phones, or laptops. Some settle to chat in hushed tones, while others just stare at the wall, completely zoned out.\n\nYou pull out your laptop, pretending to be busy, but your attention shifts when you catch movement out of the corner of your eye. Jessica leans over from the seat next to you glancing over at you.\n\n\"Hey, [name],\" she says, her voice as bright and casual as ever. \"Got a minute?\"\n\n\"Uh, sure,\" you say, a little surprised. \"What's up?\"\n\n<<if [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n As she settles in, her eyes sweep over you briefly. There's a flicker of something in her expression—curiosity, maybe—but she doesn't comment directly. Instead, she leans toward you even more in a way that feels casual and intentional.\n\n \"So, you might've overheard me totally spiraling earlier about the cheer squad being short a person,\" she begins. \"Ugh, it's all such a mess. But don't worry—I'm not here to rope you into a pyramid or anything. Yet.\"\n\n She pauses, letting the word hang in the air for a split second too long before continuing with a small laugh. \"Kidding, just kidding. Sort of.\"\n\n You blink, unsure how to respond, but before you can say anything, she shifts gears. \"Actually, I was wondering if you'd do me a little favor. Nothing major,\" she says quickly, as if sensing potential resistance.\n\n Jessica leans in slightly, her tone softening. \"We've got practice today after school, and it's crunch time with the game tomorrow. The routine's an entire mess because we're down a person, and we're trying to rework everything last minute. I thought... maybe you could come by and, you know, watch? Give us some feedback?\"\n\n Her gaze lingers for a moment, and there's a subtle shift in her expression—just enough to suggest she's choosing her words carefully. \"You've got a good eye, you know?\" she adds. \"You notice stuff. I feel you'd be able to tell us what works and what doesn't without sugarcoating it.\"\n\n You open your mouth, but she cuts in, her tone turning a touch more playful. \"And, hey, who knows? Maybe you'll get inspired and decide to give it a try yourself. I mean, just saying, we are looking for someone to fill in after all.\"\n\n The way she says it is light, like a joke, but there's a spark of something genuine in her words. Her eyes flick to you briefly, as if gauging your reaction, before she leans back in her chair with an easy smile.\n\n \"But seriously, all jokes aside, it'd mean a lot if you came by,\" she continues, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. \"Even if it's just to hang out and watch for a bit. No pressure or anything, of course!\"\n\n The words \"no pressure\" hang in the air, but the way she looks at you suggests otherwise. It's not forceful, you know Jessica isn't like that, but there's a certain charm in her approach. An almost magnetic way of making it hard to say no.\n\n \n \"Hey, so I don't know if you heard me earlier, but the cheer squad's kind of in a situation,\" she says with a soft laugh. \"We're down a person, and it's messing up everything for Friday's game.\"\n\n Her voice is breezy, but there's a faint edge of stress beneath it. \"Mandy's in Iowa and now the pyramid's all wonky, the timing's off—Coach is not happy.\"\n\n \"Anyway, I'm not asking you to join the team, that'd be a stretch,\" she says, flashing a playful grin. \"I just thought it would be helpful if you came to watch us practice tomorrow. We're making some last-minute changes to adjust for the missing person, and having someone from outside the team there could really help. You know, someone who's not stuck in their own head about how it's supposed to look.\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head slightly, her bright blue eyes sparkling. \"And honestly, you seem like the kind of person who'd give it to us straight. No fluff or sugarcoating—just 'this works' or 'this doesn't. That's what we need right now.\"\n\n She pauses, watching your reaction carefully. \"It's not a big deal or anything. You can just swing by after school, take a look, and let us know what you think. Easy, right? Think you can spare a little time for us today?\"\n \n\nWhile homeroom buzzes around you, Jessica's attention is completely locked on you, awaiting your response.\n\n \n \nYou will need to look androgynous in order to participate and dress up as a cheerleader! There will be one transformation point soon, but if you're still not androgynous after that, you'll miss the chance to try out being a cheerleader.

But good luck with the practice—I'm sure you guys will figure it out.\"\n\n Jessica's smile falters for just a split second, but she recovers quickly, flipping her hair over her shoulder with an easy laugh.\n\n \"Yeah, I totally get it,\" she says, waving a hand dismissively. \"It was kind of a weird ask, anyway. I mean, cheerleading isn't exactly everyone's cup of tea.\"\n\n Her tone is light, but there's a flicker of disappointment in her eyes. She glances at her phone as if to busy herself, then looks back at you with her usual bright demeanor.\n\n \"Thanks for considering it though,\" she says with a small shrug. \"We'll figure something out. We always do. And hey, if you change your mind, you know where to find us.\"\n\n She flashes you one last smile, this one a little softer, before turning back.\n \n\nWatching the cheerleaders practice wasn't exactly on your agenda for the week, but something about Jessica's confidence in you feels oddly encouraging. The rest of homeroom passes uneventfully, although the thought of practice lingers in your mind. When the bell rings, you grab your things and head to your next class.\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

You drop your bag by the entrance, your body still carrying the weight of a day that was far more tiring than you expected—even though you didn't participate in practice. While watching the squad had been eye-opening, it left you with a strange uncertainty.\n\n Heading upstairs, you avoid the usual evening hum of the house, skipping any distractions and going straight to your room. You tug at your shirt absentmindedly, unsure what to make of the day's events.

Your thoughts drift back to the day as you head upstairs, the soft thud of your footsteps the only noise breaking the silence. Skipping practice had seemed like the right decision at the time—watching cheerleading didn't feel like your thing, no matter how persuasive Jessica had been. But now, there's a faint nagging in the back of your mind, like you'd missed out on something.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Memories of the practice with the cheerleaders are still swirling in your mind, leaving you buzzing with both exhaustion and excitement. The mirror above your dresser catches your reflection, and for a moment, you pause. The day's events playback in your mind—Jessica's encouragement, the way the squad rallied around you, the warm laughter at practice.\n\n <<if [feminineLooks] > 59>> \n But as your eyes linger on your reflection, the changes seem impossible to ignore. The face staring back at you is yours, but softer—the traces of femininity making you look more like a tomboyish girl than the person you're used to seeing. Even your body seems to move differently, a kind of fluidity in your gestures that wasn't there before.\n\n Your hands rest against your lap as you take in the sight. You let out a deep breath, running a hand through your hair, the movement effortless but unnervingly natural. Finally, you lie back on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling.\n \n \n But as your eyes linger on the subtle shifts in your reflection—the way your features seem to sit somewhere between familiar and unfamiliar—the reality of the changes settles heavily in your chest. You let out a long sigh, brushing a hand through your hair, the strands falling easily back into place. Without thinking, you lie back on the bed, staring at the ceiling as your thoughts swirl in the stillness of the room.\n \n\n \n Your thoughts are interrupted by the sound of your door creaking open. Glancing over, you see Lily stepping inside without knocking. She's wearing an oversized hoodie and pajama pants, her black hair tied up in a messy bun.\n\n \"You've got a weird look on your face,\" she says, leaning against the doorframe. \"Brother, sister, whatever you are. What's up?\"\n\n \"Lily,\" you sigh, rolling your eyes. \"Don't you ever knock?\"\n\n \"Don't you ever lock your door?\" she shoots back, smirking. \"Seriously, though. You've been acting weird all day. Did something happen?\"\n\n You hesitate. \"It's nothing. Just a long day.\"\n\n Lily steps further into the room, plopping onto your bed without invitation. She rests her chin in her hands, narrowing her eyes at you. \"Let me guess—curse stuff?\"\n\n You give her a pointed look. \"It's not exactly something I can turn off.\"\n\n \"Yeah, no kidding,\" Lily says as she studies your features. \"You look... different. What happened?\"\n\n Her words make you pause, and for a moment, you consider brushing her off. But Lily knows about the curse and she's been surprisingly supportive, though not without her usual bluntness.\n\n [Choice: Tell Lily what you did this afternoon]\n [Choice: Decide not to]\n \n \n The knock on your door is quick and sharp, more of a warning than a request. Before you can answer, the door swings open, and your sister strides in. Lily's fiery energy fills the room like a spark catching dry wood, immediately changing the mood of the place.\n\n \"Okay, what the hell is going on with you,\" Lily demands, her hands on her hips and her eyes narrowing as they rake over you.\n\n You sit up quickly, caught off guard. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n \"Don't play dumb, [name],\" she says, stepping closer. \"Have you looked in a mirror lately? You've been changing, like, a lot. Don't think I don't notice you sneaking back in lately, all weird and quiet.\"\n\n Her gaze sharpens, her voice rising slightly. \"Your face and even the way you carry yourself—it's like you're turning into someone else, and you're just pretending like nothing's happening?\"\n\n You try to interject, but her energy doesn't leave much room for interruption.\n\n \"And you've been acting so weird too,\" she presses, facing you directly. \"I really need to know what's going on. You're my brother—or at least, you were—and I can't just sit back and pretend everything's normal when it's so obviously not.\"\n\n Her words hang in the air, and for a moment, the room feels stiflingly silent. Yet, you can see concern etched into her features beneath all the frustration.\n\n \"So, are you going to tell me what's going on?\" she says, her voice quieter now. \"Or am I supposed to figure it out myself?\"\n\n [Choice: Be honest with Lily]\n [Choice: Brush her off]\n \n\n \n The dim glow of your desk lamp fills the room as you settle into the chair, scrolling through your phone and letting your mind wander. The past few days have been a lot. New clubs, new routines, and a whirl of conversations still buzz in your mind. You think about everything that happened, your fingers idly scrolling without paying much attention to the screen.\n\n The sound of footsteps in the hallway breaks the silence, followed by a soft knock on your door. Before you can say anything, the door creaks open, and your sister steps inside. She's wearing an oversized hoodie and pajama pants, her black hair tied back into a messy bun.\n\n \"Yo,\" she says, leaning against the doorframe with her arms crossed. \"You've been awfully quiet lately. What's up with that?\"\n\n You shrug, spinning your chair to face her. \"Just tired. Long day.\"\n\n Lily raises an eyebrow, her sharp gaze scanning you like she's trying to figure out if you're telling the whole truth. \"Uh-huh,\" she says, stepping further into the room. She plops down on your bed, crossing her legs. \"Are you going to tell me what this long day is?\"\n\n Her tone is teasing, but there's a flicker of something softer beneath it.\n\n \"It's nothing serious,\" you say, hesitating slightly. \"Just trying to figure out some school stuff.\"\n\n \"Yeah, but, you're okay, right?\" she asks. \"You've just seemed... different lately.\"\n\n [Choice: Open up to her]\n [Choice: Keep it neutral]",

You're here!\"\n\n Her energy draws the attention of the other cheerleaders, and as you walk over, you catch a few surprised glances. Whispers ripple through the groups, though they're quick to stifle them. Their expressions turn welcoming as Jessica steps forward to greet you.\n<<elseif [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n Jessica catches sight of you, her smile widening as she waves you over. \"[name]! Over here!\"\n\n A few of the cheerleaders glance up, their expressions a mix of curiosity and quiet interest. You notice one or two lingering stares as you approach, though no one says anything outright. Jessica meets you halfway, her eyes briefly sweeping over you in a way that feels both friendly and a touch appraising.\n\n \n Jessica spots you almost immediately, her sharp eyes catching your approach. She waves you over, her ponytail swaying as she turns to face you. \"[name]!\" she calls, her voice carrying easily over the field.\n\n You walk up, noticing a few cheerleaders glance your way, their expressions neutral but curious. Most of them return to stretching or chatting, clearly more focused on the practice ahead. Jessica, on the other hand, strides up to meet you, her smile as bright and confident as ever.\n \n\n\"I'm glad you made it,\" she says, lightly tapping her clipboard against her palm. \"We're about to start running through the routine. Trust me when I say it's a bit of a train wreck right now. We need all the feedback we can get.\n\nShe gestures toward the group of cheerleaders behind her, some of whom are now adjusting their pom-poms or practicing small jumps. \"We're trying to make the routine work with one person down, but... well, you'll see. It's not pretty.\"\n\nYou nod, glancing at the squad as they assemble near the center of the field. Jessica steps to your side, keeping her tone casual but appreciative. \"Feel free to call out if you see something weird. You've got the perspective we need—no sugarcoating, alright?\"\n\n\"Got it,\" you reply, managing a small grin.\n\n\"Good,\" Jessica grins back, motioning toward a spot near the sidelines. \"Grab a seat over there. You'll be able to see everything, and I'll check in with you after the first run-through.\"\n\n\"Alright, team!\" she shouts, clapping her hands. \"Let's take it from the top. No slacking, and keep it tight. [name]'s watching, so don't make us look bad.\"\n\nThere's a light ripple of laughter through the group, and you can't help but smirk as Jessica takes her place at the front. You settle onto a seat, the energy of the squad buzzing in the air as they begin their routine. \n\nWatching them move in near-perfect synchronization, you're instantly able to spot where the gaps are. Places where someone should be but isn't, moments where the flow stumbles ever so slightly. It's clear the squad is trying their hardest to make it work. \n\nThe routine builds to its climax—the pyramid—but it's clear something's off. One of the bases stumbles slightly, causing the formation to wobble before they manage to bring it back together. A mix of frustration and relief floods their faces as they stop.\n\nJessica exhales loudly, placing her hands on her hips. \"Not bad, but not great either,\" she says, turning to the group. \"We're still missing the balance without Mandy. If we don't figure this out by Friday, we're going to look half-baked out there.\"\n\n<<if [feminineLooks] > 59>> \n Jessica doesn't waste a second before heading straight to you. \"Okay, [name], spill,\" she says, crossing her arms. \"How bad was it?\"\n\n You offer your feedback, pointing out where the routine feels unbalanced and suggesting adjustments for the pyramid. Jessica listens closely, nodding thoughtfully.\n\n \"You know,\" she says, her eyes sparkling. \"You've got a knack for this. Seriously, you should think about joining us. I mean, you'd look amazing in the uniform, and we really need someone who can step in last-minute.\"\n\n Her voice carries a mix of playfulness and genuine enthusiasm as she gestures toward the group. \"Come on, just try it for today. See how it feels. You'd be helping us out so much, and I promise, it's really fun.\"\n\n The other cheerleaders exchange glances, whispering to each other. None seem opposed to the idea, if anything, they seem excited by the possibility of having you.\n<<elseif [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n Jessica walks over, a spark of determination in her eyes. \"Alright, [name],\" she says, tilting her head. \"Be honest—what do you think?\"\n\n You offer your feedback as Jessica nods along. Her expression shifts though as an idea seems to strike her.\n\n \"You know, you've got a really good eye for this,\" she says, leaning in slightly her tone casual but with a teasing edge. \"Honestly, you'd kill it out here. Have you ever thought about, I don't know... trying it yourself?\"\n\n She gestures toward the team with a grin. \"I'm just saying, we could use someone who can keep up with this kind of stuff. You'd fit right in.\"\n\n Her words linger and you can tell they're sincere. The other cheerleaders glance over, a few nodding in agreement.\n\n \n Jessica walks over to you, her expression more thoughtful than usual. \"Okay, give it to me straight,\" she says, crossing her arms. \"What do you think? Is it as bad as it feels?\"\n\n You hesitate but soon begin offering your feedback. Jessica listens intently, nodding as you point out specific moments where the routine feels off.\n\n \"Good notes,\" she says, flashing you a quick smile. \"Thanks for watching. I'll figure something out for the pyramid.\"\n\n She heads back to the squad, clapping her hands to rally them for another run-through.\n \n\n<<if [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n Jessica steps closer, her tone softening slightly. \"I don't mean to pressure you or anything,\" she says. \"But seriously—just think about it. You'd be a lifesaver.\"\n\n The squad waits nearby, stretching and chatting quietly.

You can't help but judge how bad the boy's locker room smells in comparison. Jessica hums softly as she rifles through a large bin, her perfectly manicured nails tapping against the plastic as she sifts through the neatly folded uniforms. The sounds of her rummaging fills the otherwise quiet room, punctuated by her occasional mutterings.\n\n\"Let's see, Mandy's usual size is too small, but this one should work,\" she says, pulling out a top in the school's signature colors. She holds it up briefly, glancing at you with a grin. \"Here. It's stretchy, so it'll fit fine. Plus, it'll look great on you.\"\n\n\"And for the bottom...\" she says. \"Aha! Here!\"\n\nIn one hand, Jessica holds a pair of fitted cheer shorts, their sleek design clearly made for practicality. In the other, a pleated cheer skirt, its vibrant color and crisp folds embodying the iconic cheerleader aesthetic. She turns to you, holding them up side by side with an appraising look.\n\n\"What is this?\" you ask, despite fully knowing what the options mean.\n\n\"It's the moment of truth,\" she says, her tone light but with a touch of amusement. \"Shorts or skirt? No pressure—just pick whatever feels right for you.\"\n\nShe sets both options on the bench, stepping back and leaning casually against the lockers. \"I'll give you some space to change. Take your time,\" Jessica says, a playful twinkle in her eyes.\n\n \n \n \n \"Hey,\" she says suddenly, her tone softening. Her gaze flickers to you—not your face, but somewhere lower. \"This might sound random, but... are you okay?\"\n\n Your stomach flips, and you realize with a jolt that her sharp eyes might've caught on to something you've been trying to hide. You glance down instinctively, your chest feeling heavier under the pressure of the binding.\n\n \"No judgment or anything,\" she adds. \"It's just that if you're gonna be moving around a lot, and you're binding or whatever... It might not be the best idea for practice.\"\n\n \"It's just... you know,\" you say softly.\n\n \"Like I said, no judgment,\" she says holding up a hand. \"We've got a ton of extras in here. You should grab a sports bra or something—it'll help. Last thing you need is to feel uncomfortable or hurt yourself.\"\n\n She pulls out a clean sports bra with a simple design. She holds it up briefly before placing it on the bench beside the other options. \"It's totally up to you, but I think it'll make a difference.\"\n\n \"Anyway, just let me know when you're ready,\" she says, stepping toward the door. \"And don't stress. You've got this.\"\n<<elseif [breastsProg] > 1>> \n Jessica's grin is bright as she looks at you, but as her gaze flickers over your chest, she hesitates for a moment. Her eyebrows knit briefly before smoothing into a neutral expression.\n\n \n Her gaze flickers briefly to your chest, and you can see the realization hit her as her smile turns a little more relaxed. She doesn't comment, though, instead nodding approvingly. \"The top should fit fine over what you're wearing,\" she says lightly.\n\n She steps toward the door, pausing just enough to glance back over her shoulder. \"If you need anything else, just let me know. We've got backup stuff, and the girls are pros at making things work.\"\n \n \n \n \n \"Hey, um... do you have a sports bra or something?\" she asks, her tone casual.\n\n \"Uh, no,\" you freeze, heat rising to your cheeks. \"I didn't really think about that.\"\n\n Jessica's smile softens into something more understanding. \"No worries,\" she says quickly, already crouching to dig through the bin again. \"We've got plenty of extras. You definitely don't want to be jumping around out there without one. Trust me when I say it's not fun.\" \n\n After a moment, she pulls out a black sports bra, holding it up like a trophy. \"Here we go. This one's stretchy, so it should work for now. I'll let you change. You're going to look great though—I can already tell.\"\n \n \n\nThe door swings shut behind her, leaving you alone in the quiet locker room.

You pull it free, folding it and safely placing it on the bench. Next, you let your fingers hook into the waistband of your pants. You push them down, stepping out of the pooled fabric. You're left standing in only your boxers, chest heaving.\n\n \n \n \n You glance at the black sports bra Jessica handed you. It feels surprisingly lightweight in your hands. It's simple, functional, and clearly meant for support during activity. Holding it still sends a jolt of hesitation running through you though.\n\n It's fine, [name], you tell yourself, exhaling slowly. It's just part of the uniform after all, right?\n\n You slip the bra over your head, the elastic band snapping lightly into place as you adjust the straps. The fabric hugs your chest snugly, but not uncomfortably, and as you shift around, it becomes clear why cheerleaders wear these. They make your boobs feel so much more comfortable, the sensation being oddly reassuring despite its unfamiliarity. \n\n \n \n \n Cheerleading Skirt Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n \n Your fingers hover over the pleated cheerleading skirt lying on the bench. It's bold, iconic, and definitely out of your comfort zone. But something about it draws you in. Maybe it's because of its vibrant color, the way it flares out, or the way it symbolizes confident femininity. You swallow hard, picking it up slowly, the fabric feeling surprisingly soft and light against your fingertips.\n\n You step into the skirt one leg at a time, the cool material brushing against your creamy skin as you pull it up. \n <<if [adultPref] > 0>> \n You give a little wiggle to make it fit as the skirt flares enticingly around your pert rear. \n \n It fits snugly on your waist, the pleats falling neatly into place as they swish gently with your movements. You adjust the waistband slightly, smoothing it out and ensuring it fits just right.\n\n The skirt changes your silhouette, softening it, highlighting your legs and hips in a way that's new and unfamiliar.\n\n \n \n \n Cheerleading Shorts Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n You pick up the pair of fitted cheer shorts from the bench. The skirt might be the iconic choice, sure, but the shorts feel like the safer option—less attention-grabbing, more manageable. The outfit seem almost out of place in your hands, a far cry from your usual attire, but there's something about them that draws your attention and urges you forward.\n\n The cool air brushes against your \n \n shaved \n \n \n legs, the fabric gliding smoothly over your creamy thighs. The snug waistband settles just right, resting comfortably near your waist without feeling restrictive.\n\n Looking down, you adjust them slightly, the fit accentuating the lines of your legs in a way that feels both unfamiliar and surprisingly flattering. The school colors pop against your skin, giving the outfit a vibrant energy.\n\n The material clings securely but doesn't feel tight, molding to your shape. The outfit feels light, freeing, and a little daring, as if you're stepping into a role you never expected to play. As you adjust the waistband one last time, you can't help but admire it.\n \n\nYou pick up the top, running your fingers over the material. It's soft, smooth, and stretchy, designed to hug the body in all the right places. You slide it over your head, the cool material brushing against smooth skin as you pull it down. The fit is close, hugging your torso as it molds to your shape. You tuck it in, letting it frame your waist and highlighting the subtle curves you hadn't thought about before. The way the fabric clings highlights your posture, making you look different in a way you can't quite describe.\n\nA knock at the door jolts you back to reality, Jessica's voice light and playful. \"[name], are you coming out, or do I need to drag you out to show off?\"\n\nYou roll your eyes, shaking off the strange mix of emotions. \"Coming!\" you call.\n\n \nThe first option will lead to a more natural reaction, while the second one is kind of fan service. Everyone will fawn over you and call you cute. You're free to choose the second one though, I wrote it for a reason. \n(Not to mention the fact that I prefer the fan service variant as well.)\n \n\n[Choice: Nervously step out of the locker room]\n[Choice: Have some confidence!

One by one, their heads turn in your direction, their eyes widening in unison as they take in the sight of you in the cheerleading uniform. \n \n \n The pleated skirt sways gently with each step, catching the light and moving effortlessly, \n \n \n The cheerleading shorts hugs your hips comfortably, flexing with each movement and catching the light as they shift effortlessly with each step, \n \n \n while the fitted top accentuates your form in a way that makes you feel acutely aware of every glance.\n\n For a moment, no one says anything, their surprise hanging in the air. Jessica then breaks the silence with a delighted squeal, clapping her hands together. \"Oh my God! [name], you look so cute!\"\n\n One of the other cheerleaders leans forward with a grin. \"No kidding! Are we sure you've never done this before? You look like you were born to wear that.\"\n\n \"Seriously,\" another chimes in. \"You totally look like one of us. Like, if you told me you were on the squad all year, I'd believe it.\"\n\n You feel your cheeks flush, heat rising to your face under their barrage of compliments. \"Uh... thanks?\" you mumble, shifting your weight from foot to foot.\n\n \"Alright, team, let's give [name] a proper welcome!\" Jessica says as she steps forward, her confidence radiating as she gently grabs your hand and pulls you closer to the group. \"Not only does he look amazing, he's also saving our asses today.\"\n\n \"Thank you, seriously,\" a brunette says, nodding earnestly. \"You don't know how much this means to us. We were so stressed about fixing the routine without Mandy, and now we actually have a shot. Not to mention you look amazing as a cheerleader!\"\n\n \"See, [name]?\" Jessica beams, clearly loving the energy. \"You've got the look, the vibe, and now you're part of the squad. We really couldn't have asked for more.\"\n\n You swallow, trying to process the whirlwind of compliments and gratitude. It's overwhelming, sure, but not in a bad way. There's something oddly affirming about the way they look at you, like you've seamlessly stepped into their world.\n\n Jessica nudges you lightly with her elbow. \"Alright, cutie, let's get you warmed up and show you the ropes. We're all in this together now, and trust me when I say you're going to kill it out here.\"\n\n \n \n \n The door swings open with a faint creak, and you step out You make your way onto the sideline, the sunlight spilling across the field and catching the colors of the uniform. \n \n \n The pleated cheer skirt sways lightly with your movements, brushing against your legs as the fitted top hugs your frame. \n \n \n The snug cheer shorts cling comfortably to your hips, moving seamlessly with your every step, while the fitted top hugs your frame. \n \n \n For a moment, the world feels eerily quiet as all eyes turn toward you.\n\n The cheerleaders pause mid-conversation, their chatter fading into stunned silence as they take you in. A breeze ripples through the field and you feel a faint flush rise to your cheeks under their gazes.\n\n \"Oh my God!\" Jessica exclaims, the first to react. Her face lights up with a mix of excitement and admiration. \"You look amazing!\"\n\n One of the other cheerleaders lets out a low whistle, her lips curling into a grin. \"Are you sure you've never done this before?\"\n\n Another girl nudges her teammate, whispering something you can't quite catch but that earns a round of soft giggles. Their expressions aren't mocking though, not at all. They're warm, surprised, and more than a little impressed.\n\n \"I mean, look at you! Jessica steps forward, her ponytail bouncing as she gestures toward you. \"You look like you've been doing this forever.\"\n\n You shift slightly, your Converses scuffing the ground as you try to process the attention. \"Uh, thanks,\" you mumble, glancing down at the uniform and adjusting it.\n\n \n \"The skirt was definitely the right choice,\" Jessica grins even wider, her hands on her hips. \"You're seriously killing it.\"\n \n \n \"The shorts were definitely the right choice,\" Jessica says. \"A skirt might have been a bit too much.\"\n \n\n The rest of the squad nods in agreement, and one of the girls steps closer. \"You look like you belong out here with us! This is going to be so much fun, thanks for doing this.\"\n\n \"Alright, everyone!\" Jessica says, clapping her hands together. \"Let's get [name] warmed up and run through the routine.

Standing at the center of the group, Jessica radiates confidence, gesturing for everyone to come closer. The rest of the squad is already watching you with a mix of curiosity and excitement, their chatter quieter than before. You glance down at your cheerleading outfit, still getting used to the feel of the lightweight fabric and how it moves with you. Despite the initial nerves, the uniform isn't as bad as you thought—it's comfortable, almost natural.\n\n\"Okay, so here's the deal,\" Jessica says, stepping forward. She holds the clipboard like it's a microphone. \"We're going to start [name] off with the basics—warm-ups, jumps, stunts, and maybe a short cheer. No pressure, no stress. We're just here to have fun and get him up to speed. Let's start with warm-ups!\"\n\nThe squad forms a wide circle on the grass, their movements fluid and synchronized as they begin the warm-up routine. Jessica stands at the center, leading with a natural authority that makes following her almost effortless.\n\n\"Alright, stretch it out!\" she calls out, raising her arms above her head. \"Big circles—nice and slow. Let's loosen those shoulders.\"\n\nYou follow along as the cheerleaders stretch, their movements graceful yet practical. Arm circles come first, your arms sweeping in wide arcs. Jessica moves around the circle, offering pointers as she goes.\n\n\"Keep it controlled, [name],\" she says, her voice encouraging. \"You're already doing great, but don't rush it.\"\n\nFrom there, you transition to toe touches. Jessica demonstrates, folding herself in half with perfect form, her hands brushing the ground effortlessly.\n\n\"Don't worry if you can't touch your toes,\" she says, glancing your way with a playful grin. \"Just reach as far as you can. Flexibility comes with practice.\"\n\nTo your surprise, you manage to touch your toes on the first try, though your hamstrings protest slightly. One of the cheerleaders nearby raises an eyebrow.\n\n\"Wow,\" she says, impressed. \"Most newbies can't do that right off the bat. Are you sure you're not secretly a gymnast or something?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" you shake your head, laughing. \"Just lucky, I guess.\"\n\nThe warm-up continues with lunges, side stretches, and hip openers. Each move is explained clearly, and you quickly pick up the rhythm of the routine. The cheerleaders are supportive, occasionally glancing your way with nods of approval.\n\nJessica saves the splits for last, demonstrating with an effortless glide into a perfect position on the grass. The squad follows suit, each member easing into their own version of the stretch. You notice that some are more flexible than others though.\n\n\"Alright, [name],\" Jessica says, her tone light but encouraging. \"Let's see what you've got. Don't push too hard—just go as far as feels comfortable.\"\n\n\"Okay, let me try,\" you murmur, sliding into the position. You feel a mix of tension and determination, and while you don't quite hit the full split, you're closer than you expected.\n\n\"Nice!\" Jessica says, clapping lightly. \"For a first-timer, that's seriously impressive. You'll be nailing these in no time!\"\n\nThe squad finishes with a few deep breaths and gentle twists to cool down. You wonder how you should approach the final exercise in warm-ups.\n\n[Choice: Push yourself]\n[Choice: Focus on precision]",

Although it's exhausting, you feel a sense of accomplishment with every improvement.\n\n \"That's the kind of effort we need,\" Jessica says when she glances your way, giving you an approving nod. \"If you keep that up, you're going to be a pro in no time.\"\n\n \n \n You move carefully, making sure each stretch feels deliberate and balanced.\n\n \"Good form,\" Jessica says, watching with a thoughtful expression. \"Don't forget, precision is just as important as flexibility.\"\n \n\nAs Jessica claps to signal the end of the warm-ups, you rise to your feet, feeling a sudden, sharp ache shoot through your arches. You wince slightly, glancing down at your shoes. Your trusty Converses, while stylish and comfortable enough for everyday wear, are clearly not designed for the demands of cheerleading.\n\n\"You good, [name]?\" Jessica asks, noticing your slight hesitation immediately. She steps closer with a curious tilt of her head. \"Is everything alright?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's just...\" you shift your weight, grimacing. \"My feet are kind of killing me after that.\"\n\nJessica's gaze drops to your shoes, and her expression quickly shifts to one of amused exasperation. \"Oh no, Converses? [name], those are not going to cut it out here.\"\n\nOne of the other cheerleaders, Mia, laughs softly from nearby. \"Yeah, those are cute and all, but you'll be limping by the end of practice if you keep wearing them.\"\n\nJessica spins on her heel, striding over to a storage bin near the sidelines. \"Luckily for you, we've got extras,\" she calls over her shoulder. \"Can't have you breaking down before we even get to the fun stuff, can we.\"\n\nShe digs through the bin with practiced efficiency, eventually pulling out a pair of white cheerleading sneakers. They're lightweight, sleek, and clearly designed for high-impact movement. She walks back over, holding them out with a grin.\n\n\"Here, try these on,\" she says. \"They're not custom-fit or anything, but I think they should fit your feet.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" you ask, taking the sneakers. Their clean, professional look stands in stark contrast to your scuffed Converses. \"I don't want to mess up your extras or anything.\"\n\n\"Please,\" Jessica says, waving off your concern with a laugh. \"These are for emergencies, and this definitely qualifies as one. Your feet will thank you.\"\n\nYou make your way to the bleachers, taking a seat. You slip off your shoes and pull on the sneakers. They fit snugly, and the cushioned soles immediately provide relief to your aching feet. You stand up, testing them with a few careful steps, and the difference is night and day.\n\n\"These are a lot better,\" you say.\n\n\"Now you're officially one of us,\" Jessica says, crossing her arms and smirking. \"You're even complete with proper shoes!\"\n\n<<if [hairStyle] is 0 and [hairProg] > 1>> \n \n \n As you test out the new sneakers, bouncing lightly on your feet, Jessica's eyes flicker to your face, then your hair. She tilts her head, her smile turning playful. \"Alright, [name], you're almost there. Shoes? Check. Uniform? Check. But...\" she gestures toward your hair, which falls freely around your face. \"This needs to be tied back. Safety first. You don't want it getting in your way while you're jumping or stunting.\"\n\n \"Yeah, that makes sense,\" you say, reaching up and brushing a strand of hair out of your eyes. \"The issue is I, uh... don't really know how to tie it up.\"\n\n \"Wait, seriously?\" she asks, her eyes widening. \"You've never had to tie your hair before?\"\n\n \"Not really, no,\" you shrug, feeling a little sheepish.\n\n \"Alright, we're fixing that right this instant,\" Jessica says, her expression determined. \"You've got to know how to do this if you're going to survive cheerleading.\" She pulls a spare hair tie from her wrist and motions for you to sit on the bench nearby.\n\n \"When did I say I was going to keep doing this?\" you ask.\n\n \"Okay!\" Jessica says loudly, ignoring what you just said. \"First lesson in hair tying 101. It's easy once you get the hang of it, watch me first.\"\n\n She lets her hair loose and gathers it with both hands, her fingers moving with practiced ease as she pulls it back into a sleek ponytail. \"Step one: collect all your hair like this. You want it smooth, no bumps. Step two: hold it tight in one hand. Step three: loop the hair tie around it, twist, and loop again until it's secure.\" She finishes with a flourish, flicking her ponytail for emphasis.\n\n \"Uhh,\" you say, a little overwhelmed by how effortless she made it look.\n\n \"Come on, it's not that hard,\" she says, laughing softly. \"Here, I'll talk you through it.\"\n\n She stands behind you, gently gathering your hair. \"Alright, hold it like this,\" she says, moving your hand and placing it over the gathered strands. Her soft hands guide yours briefly, showing you how to smooth it down. \"Now, keep it tight and hold it in one hand.\"\n\n You do as she says, your grip a little awkward but manageable.\n\n \"Good, now take the hair tie and loop it around the base of the ponytail,\" she instructs, handing one to you. She demonstrates the motion with her own hand.\n\n You fumble a bit, although you're unsure if you're bad at tying your hair or intimidated by Jessica's presence. But after a few tries, you manage to twist the hair tie and loop it a second time. It's not perfect, but it holds.\n\n \"Not bad!\" Jessica says, stepping back to admire your work. \"A little loose, but hey, for a first try? That's solid. Let me fix it for you since you'll be exercising.\"\n\n She reaches out, tightening the ponytail with a practiced tug and smoothing down any stray strands. She smiles and crosses her arms. \"Now you're officially ready for cheerleading survival mode.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n As you test out the new sneakers, Jessica's gaze shifts to your hair, and she raises an eyebrow. \"Alright, one last thing,\" she says. \"The shoes are perfect, the uniform's on point, but you've got to tie your hair back. Can't have it flying everywhere when you're jumping.\"\n\n You nod, already pulling a hair tie out of your pocket. \"Yeah, I got it.\"\n\n Jessica watches with an impressed smile as you quickly gather your hair and secure it into a neat ponytail. \"Okay, look at you,\" she says, a grin on her face. \"Not your first rodeo, huh?\"\n\n \"I've done this before,\" you say, brushing a stray strand out of your face.\n\n Jessica laughs lightly, flicking her own ponytail over her shoulder. \"Nice, you're ahead of the game. Now, you're officially ready to cheer.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\"Looking good, [name],\" Mia nods approvingly from her spot nearby. \"Now you won't have an excuse not to keep up.\"\n\nThe squad laughs lightly, the camaraderie making the moment feel less intimidating. The cheer shoes feel like a small but significant step into this new world of femininity, and you can't help but feel \n<<if [transgender] > 14>> \n excited.\n\n \n nervous.\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]",

Jumps are the bread and butter of cheerleading, after all!\"\n\nShe steps to the front, her posture perfect as she demonstrates the first move. \"We'll start with the basic toe touch. Watch closely.\"\n\nWith a swift, practiced motion, Jessica swings her arms down, jumps high into the air, and snaps her legs into a perfect V. Her toes point elegantly, and she lands softly, barely making a sound.\n\n\"Notice the timing, everyone,\" she says as she straightens. \"Arms lead, then legs. Keep everything tight and sharp.

Arms lead, legs snap, land, and spring into the second jump.

The squad's encouragement fills you with excitement and determination. You swing your arms back, plant your feet firmly, and push off with all your strength.\n\n The air feels electric as you leap upward, your arms slicing through the air. Your legs snap into a perfect V midair, your toes instinctively pointing as you reach the peak of the jump. The movement feels effortless, almost like muscle memory. The ground rushes up to meet as you land lightly, your knees bending to absorb any impact. The squad claps and cheers, but you don't stop. You're already pushing off for the second jump, after all.\n\n The momentum carries you upward again, your body moving with practiced precision even though this is your first attempt. Your arms swing in perfect sync, and your legs snap into another clean toe touch, your form as sharp as the first. As you land, the grass feels solid beneath your feet, and you straighten up, the adrenaline surging through your veins.\n\n For a moment, the field is silent as the squad processes what they've just seen. Then, the cheerleaders erupt into cheers and applause, a few of them laughing in disbelief.\n\n \"Okay, what just happened?\" Jessica says. \"[name], that was insane! I was expecting good, but that was next-level.\"\n\n \"You're making the rest of us look bad!\" Mia says, stepping forward. \"Who even lands a double toe touch that clean on their first try?\"\n\n \"I'm just lucky, I guess?\" you say, laughing nervously. Your cheeks flush red from the praise though.\n\n \"[name], that wasn't luck,\" Jessica says, stepping closer and placing a hand on your shoulder. \"That was raw talent. You've got the timing, the strength, and the form. Honestly, if you keep this up, you're going to be one of the best on this squad. Hell, maybe even the best. We'll see over the coming months, I suppose.\"\n\n \"Wait, but I didn't agree to do this for a—\"\n\n \"Let's go, [name]!\" Jessica calls over her shoulder, her tone so cheerful it's impossible to argue.\n\n One of the cheerleaders leans toward you with a smirk on her face. \"Yeah, good luck with that. Once Jessica sets her sights on something, there's no escape.\"\n\n You sigh as you jog to catch up with the group. Somehow, it feels like you've already been recruited, whether you agreed or not.\n\n \n \n You take a deep breath, your heart pounding as you step into position. The squad's attention is all on you, their encouraging smiles and nods giving you a bit more confidence. Jessica stands nearby, her clipboard tucked under one arm, her eyes filled with curiosity.\n\n \"Alright, [name],\" she says. \"Let's see that toe touch again. Focus on your form—arms strong, legs sharp, toes pointed. You've got this!\"\n\n The squad falls silent, their anticipation palpable as they watch. You swing your arms down, gathering momentum, and in one fluid motion, you jump. Your legs snap into a clean V midair, and the movement feels almost like muscle memory already. As you land softly, the squad erupts into applause.\n\n \"Woah, that was sharp!\" one of the girls says, clapping her hands.\n\n \"Perfect execution,\" Mia chimes in. \"Seriously, [name], where have you been hiding this talent?\"\n\n \"That's what I'm talking about!\" Jessica says, stepping forward with a wide grin. \"Your height was awesome, your form was clean, and your landing was smooth as butter. Honestly, you've got a gift for this. People usually take weeks to get this right.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you say, feeling a swell of pride at their reactions.\n\n \"Alright then, let's work on refining it even more,\" Jessica continues, gesturing for you to reset. \"Try to keep your toes even sharper and don't forget to keep your arms tight on the swing. These small details make a huge difference.\"\n\n You nod, taking your place again. This time, you focus on everything Jessica pointed out. When you jump again, it feels even cleaner, and the squad's cheers only grow louder.\n\n \"See?\" Jessica says, laughing lightly. \"That's perfect. You're going to make the rest of us step up our game, [name].\"\n\n The cheerleaders exchange glances, their expressions a mix of admiration and excitement. One of them, a redhead with a playful smirk, leans over to Mia. \"We're totally stealing him, right?\"\n\n \"Oh, for sure,\" Mia grins.\n\n \"Alright, team, I know we're excited, but let's keep it moving!\" Jessica says, snapping the group back to attention. \"[name], your form's already amazing, and you've got the potential to take it even further.\"\n\n As the squad shifts back into formation, you feel a quiet sense of accomplishment. Sticking to the basics might not have been the flashiest choice, sure, but it's clear that your effort and focus haven't gone unnoticed. The squad's encouragement only fuels you as the practice continues, and you start to think that maybe—just maybe—you've found something you're really good at.\n \n\n [Choice: Move onto stunts]",

This is where we really bring the wow factor.\"\n\nThe cheerleaders respond enthusiastically, their energy infectious. Jessica gestures for everyone to form smaller groups, splitting the squad into stunt teams of three to five. She places you in a group with Mia and two other experienced bases, Ashley and Tori.\n\n\"Okay, [name], remember stunting is all about trust, balance, and strength,\" she begins, her tone encouraging. \"Everyone has a role, and today you're going to start as a base. It's the foundation of any stunt.\"\n\nAshley steps forward, rolling her shoulders. \"As a base, your job is to keep the flyer stable. You'll be holding them up, so make sure your grip is firm, your legs are strong, and you work with your partner.\"\n\nTori nods, positioning herself next to you. \"It's all about teamwork. You won't do it alone—everything we do is synchronized. Don't worry though, Mia's one of the best flyers we have. She'll make it easy.\"\n\nMia grins, her confidence radiating as she adjusts her ponytail. \"I'll make you look good,\" she says, playfully, stepping forward to take her position.\n\nJessica steps in to guide you. \"[name], hold out your hands like this.\" She demonstrates the proper grip, her hands cupped and firm. \"You and Tori will lock your hands together to create a stable platform. Keep your elbows bent but strong, and don't let your arms wobble.\"\n\nYou follow her instructions, linking hands with Tori. The position feels solid, though the idea of lifting someone into the air still makes your heart race.\n\n\"Alright, bases, ready?\" Jessica calls out as Mia steps lightly onto the platform created by your hands.\n\n\"Ready!\" Tori responds, her voice steady.\n\n<<if [confident] > [shy]>> \n \"Ready!\" you repeat.\n\n \n \"R-Ready!\" you say.\n \n\n\"Go!\" Jessica yells.\n\nYou and Tori lift together, your arms bracing as Mia rises into the air. Her movements are fluid, and she balances effortlessly as you hold her steady. Your muscles strain slightly, but the adrenaline and focus make it feel easy.\n\n\"Great form, [name]!\" Jessica says. \"You're rock solid. Keep it up!\"\n\nMia shifts her position slightly, extending one leg and holding her arms high. The squad cheers loudly, and you feel a surge of pride.\n\nWhen it's time to dismount, Mia calls out, \"Coming down!\"\n\nYou and Tori lower her gently, your movements perfectly synchronized. Mia lands lightly on her feet, spinning around to face you with a grin. \"Not bad for a newbie,\" she says, giving you a high-five.\n\nJessica steps in again, her eyes gleaming with approval. \"Alright, let's mix it up. [name], let's have you spotting next. It's just as important as basing. You are the safety net, after all.\"\n\nShe demonstrates the spotter's position, standing behind the flyer with her hands ready to catch if anything goes wrong. \"Your job is to keep Mia safe. Stay focused and watch her movements. Be ready to support if needed at all times.\"\n\nYou take your place behind Mia, your stance steady. As the bases lift her again, you keep your eyes locked on her, your hands hovering just below her back and legs.\n\n\"Great job!\" Jessica says as the stunt goes off without a hitch. \"You're a natural at this too.\"\n\nAs the group breaks for water, the other cheerleaders come over, their expressions a mix of admiration and excitement.\n\n\"Seriously, [name], you're picking this all up faster than anyone I've ever seen,\" Ashley says, shaking her head. \"If I hadn't known, I could've sworn you've been cheering for years.\"\n\n\"Tell me about it,\" Mia chimes in. \"I've had bases who cheer on a college team and even they weren't this steady.\"\n\n\"Honestly, if you ever want to make this permanent, you'd be a star,\" Jessica says.\n\nThe cheerleaders nod in agreement, their encouragement making the experience feel exhilarating. You glance toward the other flyers practicing their stunts, their movements graceful and effortless as they're lifted into the air. A flicker of curiosity sparks in your mind—what would it feel like to be the one soaring above the rest?\n\n[Choice: Ask about flying]\n[Choice: Decide against it]",

Mia raises an eyebrow, grinning. \"[name] as a flyer? That would be really fun to see.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll be honest—flyers are usually the smallest and lightest people on the team,\" Jessica says, her tone thoughtful as she looks you over. \"You're like 5'10, that's definitely on the taller side for that role. Flyers need to be super easy to lift and balance, which is why it's usually the shorter squad members.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah, I get it,\" you say, not entirely surprised.\n\n\"That being said, I'm not about to crush your dreams,\" Jessica adds with a playful smile. \"If you want to give it a shot, we can make it work. Just don't expect to take this role permanently unless you've got a shrink ray hidden somewhere.\"\n\nJessica claps her hands to get everyone's attention. \"Alright, team, we've got a special request! [name] wants to try being a flyer, so let's show him what it's all about.\"\n\nThe squad cheers, clearly excited to see you take on the challenge. Jessica organizes a stunt group with Mia and Ashley as the bases and Tori as the spotter.\n\n\"Okay, [name], you need to have trust in your bases and spotter as a flyer,\" Jessica says. \"When you step onto the bases, keep your core tight, your movements controlled, and trust your team to hold you steady. We'll start with something simple—a basic prep stunt.\"\n\nYou take a deep breath, stepping forward as Mia and Ashley position themselves. Tori gives you a reassuring nod from behind.\n\n\"Ready?\" Mia asks, her hands steady.\n\n\"Ready,\" you reply, your heart racing as you place your hands on their shoulders and step onto their linked hands.\n\nAs Mia and Ashley lift you, the sensation of being airborne is both exhilarating and terrifying. You instinctively tighten your core, just as Jessica instructed, and focus on keeping your balance. The bases are solid beneath you, their strength and coordination making the lift feel almost effortless.\n\n\"Nice job!\" Jessica calls out, clapping. \"Keep your legs together and your arms up—perfect!\"\n\nYou extend your arms, and your confidence only grows as you settle into the pose. The squad cheers, and even Tori gives you a thumbs-up from below.\n\n\"Alright, now let's dismount,\" Jessica says. \"Bases, bring him down slowly.\"\n\nThe descent is smooth and you land lightly on the grass, a grin spreading across your face.\n\n\"Not bad at all, [name],\" Mia says. \"You've got the balance for it, that's for sure.\"\n\n\"That was better than I expected for your first try, although you have only been impressing me so far,\" Jessica nods. \"But, like I said, your height makes you less ideal for this role.\"\n\nAs the team regroups to continue practice, you can't help but feel proud of yourself for trying something new. The experience of being a flyer only helps you feel more confident.\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Jessica walks beside you, her smile bright as she talks about the game tomorrow.\n\n\"You're going to love it,\" she says. \"Game day energy is like nothing else. And with you on the squad? It's going to be amazing.\"\n\nAfter a bit of walking, the cheer squad piles into a cozy, casual restaurant on the edge of town. It's the kind of place with warm lighting, colorful booths, and the faint smell of sizzling burgers and fries lingering in the air. The lively chatter of other patrons mingles with the squad's laughter as Jessica leads the way, effortlessly securing a large booth in the corner.\n\n\"Alright, everyone, squeeze in,\" she says, gesturing for the group to settle. The booth is just big enough for all of you, although you have to pull up a few chairs on the sides to make room. You find yourself sandwiched between Mia and Jessica, their energy buzzing from practice.\n\nThe conversation is easy and light, the kind of chatter that makes you feel like you've been part of this group forever. They talk about everything—school drama, favorite foods, and their favorite memories from past games.\n\n\"So, [name],\" Mia says, glancing at you with a curious smile. \"Be honest with us. Did you ever think you'd end up in a cheerleading uniform?\"\n\nYou laugh nervously, rubbing the back of your neck. \"Honestly? Not in a million years.\"\n\n\"Well, you're pulling it off!\" Ashley says. \"Seriously, you didn't look out of place at all today.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it was like you were meant to do this,\" Jessica adds. \"I mean, you basically crushed every drill on your first try.\"\n\n\"Don't let it get to your head though,\" Tori says, a smirk on her face. \"We'll still make you run laps if you start slacking.\"\n\nThe group laughs, and you feel yourself relaxing more. Despite the teasing, their camaraderie is warm. Just as the conversation starts to shift to the upcoming football game, a cheerful waitress arrives at the table, her notepad in hand. She looks around at the group, her gaze sweeping over everyone.\n\n\"Well, aren't you girls just the cutest,\" she says, her tone playful. \"Cheerleaders, right? You've got that squad vibe for sure.\"\n\nYou freeze for a moment, feeling the words hang in the air. The cheerleaders all glance at your briefly, their smiles still in place, but none of them correct her. Instead, Jessica smoothly changes the subject.\n\n\"Yeah, that's us,\" she says quickly. \"We just finished practice and figured we'd treat ourselves.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, you all definitely deserve it!\" the waitress nods enthusiastically. \"Alright, let's get you all started with drinks.\"\n\nAs she takes the others' drink orders, your thoughts swirl. You know the waitress' comment wasn't malicious, not at all, but it still leaves you at a crossroads.\n\n[Choice: Correct her and say you're not a girl]\n[Choice: Quietly accept it]",

Something inside you stirs—a need to clarify, to make sure you're being seen as you.\n\n \"Actually, I'm not a girl,\" you say, your tone polite but firm.\n\n The waitress freezes for a split second, her eyes widening as her smile falters ever so slightly. Then, just as quickly, she recovers, her expression turning apologetic. \"I'm so sorry,\" she says, sincerity in her voice. \"That was my mistake. I didn't mean to assume.\"\n\n \"Don't worry about it,\" Jessica says, jumping in. \"[name]'s just special like that—keeps us all on our toes.\"\n\n \"Well, thanks for letting me know,\" the waitress says, laughing a little. \"I'll be right back with your drinks.\"\n\n As the waitress walks away, the table falls into a comfortable hum of conversation. Jessica leans toward you, her tone casual but supportive. \"That was cool of you to say something,\" she says quietly. \"It's important to speak up when you need to. We've got your back, no matter what.\"\n\n The rest of the cheerleaders reaffirm you, and the tension from earlier begins melting away. They're not treating it as a big deal—just a part of who you are.\n\n \"To [name]!\" Jessica says with a sly smile. \"For being the coolest, most talented, bestest ever non-girl on the squad.\"\n\n The rest of the cheerleaders laugh, raising their glasses as well. \"To [name]!\"\n\n You laugh along with them, feeling a sense of belonging that's impossible to put into words. You're glad you've found a group of people that accept you exactly as you are.\n\n \n \n \n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You hesitate for a moment as the waitress' words settle in the air. For reasons you can't quite explain, what she said doesn't feel wrong. In fact, there's a strange, warm sense of affirmation in her assumption.\n\n You glance around the table, half-expecting the cheerleaders to say something, but none of them do. Jessica flashes the waitress a friendly grin, and the conversation flows on effortlessly, as though nothing out of the ordinary has been said.\n\n For a moment, you think about correcting her, about pointing out the obvious—that you're not actually a girl—but the words don't come. Instead, you find yourself smiling softly, the weight of the day's events melting into a quiet sense of belonging. You find yourself realizing it doesn't bother you.\n\n No, more than that—it feels good.\n\n You catch your reflection in the glossy surface of the menu, your face framed by the soft lighting of the restaurant. You realize you \n <<if [feminineLooks] > 59>> \n look like a girl and that fact makes you oddly... comfortable. \n <<elseif [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n look androgynous, but next to a group of girls, you fit right in. \n \n \n cheated. Why did you cheat smh you shouldn't be here! \n \n You think back to the way the cheerleaders had accepted you without any question, the compliments they'd thrown your way.\n\n You're basically one of us already.\n\n You're one of the girls now.\n\n Their words echo in your mind, and for the first time, you don't feel the need to push back against them. You let out a small, quiet sigh, a smile tugging at the corners of your lips as the waitress takes your drink order.\n\n \"Water's fine,\" you say, your voice light.\n\n \"Got it,\" she replies with a cheerful nod before moving on to the next person.\n\n \"Are you alright, [name]?\" Jessica turns to you once the waitress steps away. \"You've got that look—like you're overthinking something.\"\n\n \"No, I'm good,\" you whisper. \"I'm just glad I came with you guys.\"\n\n \"Well, duh,\" Mia says, leaning her elbow on the table and giving you a playful smirk. \"You're part of the squad, we wouldn't leave you behind.\"\n\n Ashley nods. \"To [name], our star rookie!\"\n\n You laugh again, a genuine warmth bubbling up inside you as the others join in, their cheers and encouragement wrapping around you like a safety net.\n \n \n You glance around the table as the waitress moves on, chatting brightly with the other cheerleaders as she takes their drink orders. Jessica throws you a knowing smile, but she doesn't say anything about the comment. The squad seems perfectly at ease, their laughter and banter continuing without missing a beat.\n\n You shift in your seat, deciding it's better to just go along with it for now. The waitress obviously meant no harm, and the way the cheerleaders have treated you all day—like you're one of them—makes the moment feel less awkward than you thought it would.\n\n \"So, what do you think of your first cheerleading dinner so far?\" Mia says, turning back to you once the waitress walks away. \"A little different from what you usually do, right?\"\n\n \"Yeah, it's definitely different,\" you laugh lightly, relaxing into the booth. \"You all make it fun, though.\"\n\n \"This is just as much a part of the cheerleading experience as the routines, after all,\" Jessica says, grinning. \"Bonding over some food is tradition.\"\n\n \"Honestly, it's cool how you just jumped into all this today,\" Tori says, her expression softening. \"Most people would've been super nervous, but you handled it like a pro.\"\n\n You feel a small swell of pride as the cheerleaders continue to bombard you with thanks and compliments. Even if you're not too sure how you feel about being grouped with “the girls,” their easy camaraderie makes it hard to feel out of place.\n\n The waitress returns shortly with a tray of drinks, setting them down in front of everyone with a cheerful smile. \"Here you go, ladies!\" Again, you feel a brief moment of discomfort, but no one else seems to notice.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

The french fries are golden and perfectly crisp, a tempting sidekick to the main event. As the others dig into their meals, you pick up the burger, the soft bun yielding immediately under your fingers. The first bite is perfection—a juicy explosion of flavor.\n\n\"It's good, right?\" Mia asks from beside you, holding a nacho like a cigarette. \"This place has the best burgers in town, hands down.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's amazing,\" you nod. \"I didn't realize I was this hungry.\"\n\n\"Cheerleading burns a ton of calories,\" Jessica says. \"Get used to being starving after every practice.\"\n\n\"She's not kidding,\" Ashley chimes in, balancing a fry on her fork. \"One game day, I ate two of these burgers after the game. It didn't even fill me up, I was still hungry.\"\n\nThe table laughs as you take another bite, savoring the rich flavors and the simple joy that comes with sharing a meal with new friends. You find yourself relaxing more as you get further into the meal, even chiming in with a few comments and laughing at the squad's stories. Jessica teases Mia about her nacho obsession, Ashley recounts a time she tripped during a halftime routine, and Tori insists she didn't see the school mascot coming when she ran into it mid-cheer.\n\nYou join in the laughter, the day's events replaying in your mind. All of it felt surreal, yet completely natural at the same time. Silverware clink softly against the plates and the warm smell of grilled food lingers in the air.\n\nJessica, who finished her food faster than anyone else, wipes her hand on a napkin and stretches her arms over her head. \"Alright, I'm going to head outside for a breather,\" she says, sliding out of the booth. \"Too much food, too much energy—I need a minute to decompress.\"\n\n\"Jessica's decompressing?\" Mia asks, a grin on her face. \"That's a first.\"\n\nJessica laughs, tossing a glare at Mia. \"Watch it, Mia.

The restaurant door closes behind you with a soft jingle, cutting off the warmth and noise inside. The cool night air greets you, carrying with it the faint smell of pavement and nearby trees. You spot Jessica leaning against a low brick wall by the parking lot, her arms crossed loosely and her head tilted back as she looks up at the sky.\n\nYou hesitate, unsure if you should interrupt her. The Jessica you've seen all day—bright, confident, larger than life—feels distant now. It's like she's been replaced by someone quieter.\n\nStill, something about the way her shoulders are slightly hunched makes you take a step closer. \"Hey,\" you say softly.\n\nJessica glances over, a flicker of surprise in her eyes before she smiles faintly. \"Hey, [name],\" she says. Her tone is light, but there's an edge of tiredness beneath it, like she's trying to mask something more. \"What are you doing out here? The squad not entertaining enough for you?\"\n\n\"No, they're great,\" you reply, leaning against the wall beside her. \"Just thought I'd check on you. You looked like you needed a breather.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I guess I did,\" Jessica lets out a soft laugh, brushing a loose strand of hair behind her ear. \"It's nice to get some quiet sometimes, you know?\"\n\nYou nod, waiting to see if she'll say more. She does, though her words come slower, more measured.\n\n\"I love leading the squad, I really do,\" she begins, her gaze fixed somewhere in the distance. \"It's the best part of my week—getting everyone pumped up, working on routines, feeling like we're a team. But sometimes it feels like there's a lot riding on it.\"\n\nYou glance at her, her profile lit softly by the glow of the streetlights.

Don't get me wrong—I love that they trust me.

You probably didn't come out here just to listen to me ramble on about my problems.\"\n\n\"You're not rambling,\" you say gently. \"I think everyone needs a break sometimes, even you.\"\n\nJessica smiles faintly, though it doesn't quite reach her eyes. \"Yeah. Maybe.\"\n \nThe silence stretches between you, not uncomfortable but rather heavy with unspoken thoughts.

But then, something pushes you forward, and before you know it, you're speaking up.\n\n \"Okay, okay,\" you say, raising your hands slightly to grab their attention. \"I've got a story, but it's completely stupid, so don't judge me.\"\n\n \"Oh, I've got to hear this,\" Mia says, her eyes sparkling in anticipation. \"Spill it, [name].\"\n\n \"Alright, so, this took place last summer,\" you say, already holding in your laughter. \"My friend, Luke, yes that Luke, thought it'd be funny to try and ride his bike through a car wash.\"\n\n The table erupts in a mix of gasps and laughter, and Tori nearly spits out her drink. \"Wait, what?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, grinning now. \"He was like, 'It's just water, bro, how bad could it possibly be?' I was just standing there recording because, you know, I have my priorities straight.\"\n\n \"Please tell me he actually went through with it,\" Ashley says.\n\n \"Oh, he did,\" you reply, nodding emphatically. \"He rolls in all confident. It was actually working too, until the spinning brushes kicked in. First, he was like 'I'm fine!' Then the brush thing knocks him off the fucking bike. He's lying on the ground, soaking wet, and still yelling that he's alright while getting sprayed.\"\n\n \"It gets worse, it gets worse,\" you add, as the entire team howls with laughter. \"The guy who owns the car wash comes out, sees Luke lying there, and just shakes his head. He does not care in the slightest. He just mutters, 'Kids these days,' and walks back inside.\"\n\n Ashley is doubled over, gasping for air. \"Help, I can't. Luke is a legend! Please tell me you have the video.\"\n\n \"Sadly, no,\" you say, shaking your head. \"My phone got wet in the chaos. But the memory? Priceless.\"\n\n Mia wipes her eyes, still giggling. \"[name], that is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard, and I love it. I've always liked Luke, but this just cements his status as an icon.\"\n\n \"An icon of bad decisions, maybe,\" Tori adds, grinning.\n\n \"Pretty much,\" you agree.\n\n \n \n I am fully, fully aware that this story isn't that funny. It's just the best I could think of. Not to mention everything is much funnier when you're surrounded by friends.\n \n\n \n You lean back slightly in your seat, the warm buzz of the cheerleaders' laughter filling the air around you. It's easy to lose yourself in their stories, their animated gestures and vivid expressions painting pictures of the hilarious and chaotic moments they've shared. You find yourself smiling and nodding along, throwing in the occasional laugh at just the right moment.\n\n \"—and then Jessica yelled, 'Just keep smiling!' while the banner was literally eating us alive,\" Mia exclaims, nearly doubling over with laughter.\n\n \"I was still pulling pieces of it out of my hair after halftime,\" Ashley adds, grinning. \"I think it even made it into some of the photos!\"\n\n \"Classic Jessica,\" Tori adds, twirling a fry between her fingers. \"Somehow, she makes even a disaster look intentional.\"\n\n You chuckle slightly, letting the rhythm of their banter flow naturally. While their energy is infectious, you're content to stay in the background, soaking it all in.\n\n \"[name], what's your favorite part of today so far?\" Mia asks as she nudges your arm lightly. \"Was it the routine? The stunts?\"\n\n \"Honestly, it was just seeing how you all work together,\" you respond, your smile easily. \"It's like... controlled chaos, but it works. You've got this energy that's fun to be around.\"\n\n Mia grins, clearly pleased with your answer. \"We are pretty cool, aren't we?\"\n\n \"Hell yeah, we are!\" Ashley says. \"We're legendary.\"\n\n The cheerleaders continue, and you find yourself enjoying the way their stories unfold, each one building off the last. They talk about moments with the mascot, the thrill of nailing a difficult routine, and even the occasional prank pulled on rival squads.\n\n As they chatter, you stay tuned in, offering a comment or reaction here and there. You may not be the loudest voice at the table, but your quiet presence doesn't go unnoticed. Every now and then, one of the cheerleaders glances your way, their smiles warm and genuine.\n \n\nBy the time the food is nearly gone, you feel even more comfortable than before. You're glad you stayed in the restaurant and got to connect with all the \n<<if [transgender] > 14>> \n other \n \ngirls, but you do wonder what Jessica was up to the entire time.\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "You shift slightly, stepping closer so the distance between you and Jessica feels less like two people on separate paths and more like two people sharing the same moment. Your shoulder almost brushes hers as you lean gently against the wall, the cool surface grounding you.\n\n \"You know, you don't have to figure everything out by yourself,\" you say softly. \"It's okay to just... be you. Even if that doesn't match what people expect.\"\n\n Jessica glances at you, her eyes flickering with something unreadable before she lets out a quiet laugh. \"Be myself, huh? That's easier said than done.\"\n\n \"Maybe it is,\" you reply, tilting your head slightly to meet her gaze. \"But I think you're already doing it more than you realize. The squad looks up to you because you care about them, Jessica, not because you're perfect.\"\n\n Jessica looks away, her lips curving into a faint smile. \"You're good at this, you know that? Saying exactly what someone needs to hear.\"\n\n \"I'm just being honest,\" you say, the sincerity in your voice catching her attention again.\n\n For a moment, the two of you fall into a comfortable silence, the sounds of the night wrapping around you like a cocoon. The distant hum of traffic, the occasional laugh from inside the restaurant—it all fades into the background. Jessica's presence feels different now, quieter but somehow closer.\n\n \"You know, I didn't expect you to fit in with us so fast,\" she says after a beat, her voice softer now. \"It's... nice, though. Having you around. I don't know what I would have done today if you didn't volunteer to help us out. I really don't.\"\n\n Her words hang in the air, and for a moment, her eyes linger on yours. There's something unspoken in her expression, a vulnerability she's not quite ready to put into words, but it's there—an almost imperceptible shift that feels like a bridge between the two of you.\n\n \"Thanks for coming out here,\" she says, her voice barely above a whisper. \"I didn't realize how much I needed to hear that.\"\n\n \"Anytime,\" you reply, a small smile tugging at your lips.\n\n Jessica's smile widens just a little, and she nudges your shoulder lightly with hers, the gesture almost playful but with a quiet tenderness beneath it. \"Alright,\" she says, straightening up and brushing her hands off. \"We should probably head back in before the others start wondering if we've run off to join the circus or something.\"\n\n \"Yeah, we really should,\" you agree, though neither of you moves right away.\n\n As Jessica turns to walk back toward the restaurant, her pace slower than before, there's a quiet shift in the air. It's nothing you can name outright, but something about the moment feels... different—like a thread pulled taut, unnoticed until now.\n\n \n \n You lean against the wall, just a step or two away, keeping enough distance to give her space. The quiet night air hangs between you, filled with only the faint hum of passing cars and the occasional laugh from someone inside the restaurant. Jessica doesn't look at you immediately, her gaze still fixed somewhere beyond the horizon.\n\n \"It's okay to not have all the answers,\" you say, your voice steady but soft. \"You don't have to be perfect all the time.\"\n\n Jessica's lips twitch into a faint smile, though her eyes remain distant. \"Yeah, easier said than done,\" she murmurs.\n\n \"Maybe,\" you reply. \"But no one's expecting you to do everything on your own. Not really. And even if they are, it doesn't mean you have to.\"\n\n She lets out a quiet laugh, though it lacks her usual energy. \"You make it sound so simple. Just... decide to let go of it all, right?\"\n\n \"Not all of it,\" you say. \"But maybe some of it. Enough to remind yourself that it's okay to just be... human. People look up to you because they trust you, not because they think you're invincible.\"\n\n Jessica finally turns to face you, her blue eyes searching yours. For a moment, she looks like she wants to say something more, but instead, she nods. \"Thanks, [name]. You've got a weird way of making sense.\"\n\n \"I try,\" you say, chuckling lightly.\n\n The silence returns, but it's lighter now, the weight of her earlier words easing slightly. Jessica crosses her arms, glancing back toward the restaurant.\n\n \"You know, sometimes it feels like... if I let even a little bit slip, the whole thing might come crashing down,\" she says, her voice thoughtful. \"Like I have to hold it all together or it won't work.\"\n\n \"You don't have to hold everything together, that's the thing,\" you say, your tone steady. \"That's what a team is for, right? You're not doing this alone.\"\n\n Jessica exhales slowly, nodding. \"Yeah. You're right. I guess I just forget that sometimes.\"\n\n She straightens up, brushing imaginary dust off her sleeves. \"Alright, I think I'm good now. We should probably head back in before Mia eats all the fries.\"\n\n You laugh, pushing off the wall. \"That sounds about right.\"\n\n As the two of you walk back toward the restaurant, Jessica's step seems a little lighter, and though she hasn't said much, you can tell the moment meant something to her. She glances at you briefly, a small but genuine smile on her lips.\n\n \"Thanks for coming out, [name],\" she says quietly. \"I didn't realize I needed that.\"\n\n \"Anytime,\" you reply.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

The waitress swings by to drop off the check, and Jessica takes charge, expertly dividing it among the group. \n\nAs Jessica finishes dividing the check among the group, you reach into your pocket, pulling out your phone. \"Hey, let me chip in,\" you say, glancing around at the others. \"It's the least I can do after crashing your dinner.\"\n\nBefore your phone even turns on, Mia waves her hands dramatically, shaking her head. \"Oh, no way. You're practically doing us a favor by being here. You're not paying.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Ashley adds, leaning back in her chair with a grin. \"You're helping save the routine for tomorrow. That's worth way more than a burger and some fries.\"\n\nJessica smirks, placing her hand lightly on top of your phone to stop you. \"[name], consider this our way of saying thanks. You've already done more than enough just by showing up today.\"\n\nYou hesitate, glancing from face to face, but their expressions are unanimous—there's no way they're letting you pay.\n\n\"Seriously,\" Tori chimes in. \"You're part of the squad now, and squad members don't pay on their first post-practice dinner. It's tradition.\"\n\n\"Is it really?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\"Well, it is now,\" Jessica says, her tone playful but firm. \"So put that phone away and just enjoy it, alright?\"\n\nYou laugh, sliding your phone back into your pocket. \n \n You're too ashamed to even mention that you actually didn't have enough money to pay for your order anyway. \n \n\"Alright, alright. Thanks, everyone.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" Mia says with a wink. \"Just promise you'll kill it tomorrow, and we'll call it even.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" Jessica says. \"Everyone good? No excuses tomorrow—we're all showing up ready to crush it at the game.\"\n\nA chorus of agreement ripples through the squad.\n\n\"You're just saying that because you already know the routine inside and out,\" Mia teases.\n\n\"And because I have to look out for all of you,\" Jessica replies with a wink. \"Can't let us go out there looking anything less than perfect.\"\n\nMia rolls her eyes dramatically, but her smile gives her away. As everyone gathers their things and begins filling out of the restaurant, Jessica claps her hands lightly to get the squad's attention.\n\n\"Remember, tomorrow's the big day!\" she says. \"Get some rest, stay hydrated, and bring all the energy you've got. It's going to be so worth it.\"\n\nMia leans over to you as the group heads for the door, her voice teasing. \"You ready for your first game-day experience? It's gonna be wild.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I think so,\" you reply, a mix of nerves and anticipation bubbling in your chest. \"I hope so.\"\n\n\"You'll be great,\" she says with a grin, nudging your arm lightly before skipping ahead to join the others.\n\nThe night air greets you as you step outside, the cool breeze refreshing after the warmth of the restaurant. The squad lingers for a moment in the parking lot, saying their goodbyes and joking about who's going to forget their outfit tomorrow.\n\nAs the cheerleaders drift off to their cars or begin walking home, their laughter still echoing in the air, you're left with a quiet sense of belonging. The evening has cemented something undeniable: you're part of the team now.\n\n[Choice: Go Home]",

Everyone seems to know who they are and what they're doing, and I just... don't.\"\n\n \"So, what's the big deal?\" Lily asks. \"Nobody actually knows what they're doing. They just act like they do. You're probably doing better than half of them already.\"\n\n Her words are blunt, but there's a sincerity behind them that catches you off guard.\n\n \"Maybe you're right,\" you say with a faint smile. \"Its just... hard sometimes, you know?\"\n\n \"Yeah, I get it,\" Lily says, clearly not quite getting it. \"But you're not that lame of an older brother, so I think you'll figure it out. And if you don't, I'll just make fun of you until you do.\"\n\n \"Wow, thanks Lily,\" you say, rolling your eyes. \"You're a real inspiration.\"\n\n \"Obviously,\" she says, standing up and heading toward the door. \"Anyway, don't stress too much.\"\n\n She pauses at the door, looking back with a small smile before disappearing down the hallway.\n\n \n You shrug, leaning back in your chair. \"I'm fine, Lily. Just adjusting to everything. Nothing to worry about.\"\n\n Lily narrows her eyes, her skeptical expression making it clear she's not convinced. \"Sure, I bet everything's just peachy,\" she says, her tone dripping with sarcasm.\n\n \"Seriously,\" you say, offering a small smile to soften your response. \"It's just school stuff. Nothing earth-shattering.\"\n\n She watches you for a moment longer, then leans back on the bed with a dramatic sigh. \"Fine. Be mysterious. But if you start acting any weirder, I'm going to get involved.\"\n \n \"I know, I'd expect nothing less,\" you reply, chuckling softly.\n\n \"Alright, well, have fun with your super normal school life,\" Lily says, swinging her legs over the edge of the bed. She heads for the door but pauses just before stepping out. \"Good night. You've got this, or whatever.\"\n\n The door clicks shut behind her, leaving the room quiet again. The faintest hint of a smile tugs at your lips though.

Lily has a way of digging in when she's curious, and she already knows enough about your situation to guess when something's up.\n\n \"Fine,\" you begin, glancing at her. \"I spent the afternoon... practicing with the cheerleading squad.\"\n\n Lily raises an eyebrow. \"Wait, cheerleaders?\" she asks. \"Like actual cheerleaders? Jessica's squad?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you reply, running a hand through your hair. \"They needed someone to help fill in for practice, and I ended up being that someone.\"\n\n She sits up straighter on your bed, her curiosity piqued. \"Okay, that's not what I expected to hear. What happened? Did they just, like, grab you out of the hallway or something?\"\n\n \"Not exactly,\" you say, hesitating. \"Jessica asked me during homeroom. They're missing a cheerleader for the game tomorrow, and she thought I could help out.\"\n\n \"And you said yes? Did you like it?\"\n\n \"It was actually kind of fun,\" you say slowly, the words even surprising yourself. The memory of the squad's acceptance and energy is still fresh in your mind. \"They were all really nice and treated me like I belonged. It was... weird, but also kind of great.\"\n\n Lily nods, her expression thoughtful. \"And tomorrow? Are you actually going to cheer at the game?\"\n\n You let out a small laugh, the absurdity of the situation not lost on you. \"I guess I am.\"\n\n \"Wow,\" she says, leaning back against the wall. \"Well, you'll crush it. You've got the whole squad backing you up, right?\"\n\n Her words sink in, and for a moment, you feel a flicker of confidence.\n\n \"You're right.\"\n\n Lily grins, her fiery spirit returning. \"So, what's the uniform like? Please tell me you wore a skirt.\"\n\n \n You hesitate, scratching the back of your neck. \"Uh... yeah, you're right.\"\n\n The room goes silent for a beat before Lily bursts out laughing, clutching her stomach as she doubles over on your bed. \"A skirt?! This is too good. [name], this is the best thing I've ever heard in my entire life!\"\n\n \"Lily,\" you groan, but she's already rolling on your bed, her laughter echoing through the room.\n\n \"I need pictures,\" she gasps between giggles. \"Please tell me someone took pictures.\"\n\n \"Nobody took pictures,\" you mutter, the heat rising to your face betraying your embarrassment.\n\n Lily finally sits up, wiping tears from her eyes. \"I'm sorry, but I can't get over it. My big brother out there rocking a cheerleading skirt.\"\n\n You sigh, shaking your head, though you can't entirely suppress your own sheepish smile.\n\n \"But honestly?\" she says, her tone softening. \"That's pretty brave of you. I mean, stepping out like that and owning it.\"\n\n \"Thanks, Lily,\" you say quietly.\n\n \"Anytime,\" she replies, standing up and stretching. \"But seriously, if I find out someone took pictures, I'm framing them.\"\n\n \"Lily!\"\n \n \n You shrug, leaning back in your chair. \"They had me in shorts, don't worry. It wasn't as weird as it could've been.\"\n\n Lily raises an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at the corners of her mouth. \"Shorts, huh? Alright, I can see that. It's still weird but better than the alternative.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, chuckling lightly. \"It felt a little weird at first, but honestly? By the end of practice, I wasn't even thinking about it.\"\n\n She nods, her teasing softened by genuine curiosity. \"Well, as long as you didn't totally hate it. But still—cheerleading. Never thought I'd see the day.\"\n\n \"I didn't either.\"\n \n\n \"For what it's worth though, I think this whole cheerleading thing might be good for you,\" Lily says. \"It sounds like it made you happy today, and that's what matters.\"\n\n Her words catch you off guard, and you can only nod, unsure how to respond.\n\n \"Goodnight, [name],\" she says with a grin before disappearing down the hall.\n\n As you sit alone in your room, her words linger. Tomorrow will be a challenge, but you allow yourself to feel hope for now.\n\n \n \"It's just been a long day,\" you say vaguely, avoiding her gaze. As supportive as your sister has been, the idea of telling her about the cheerleading practice feels... complicated. \"Nothing special.\"\n\n Lily raises an eyebrow, clearly not buying it. \"Uh-huh. Sure. Because that totally explains why you look all... like this.\" She gestures vaguely at you, her hand waving in the air as if to encompass your entire being.\n\n \"Like what?\" you ask, narrowing your eyes.\n\n \"Like... I don't know,\" she says. \"Different, I guess. You look softer or something. Not in a bad way! Just... different.\"\n\n You shrug, trying to brush it off. \"It's probably just the [referto] doing its thing. Nothing new there.\"\n\n Lily tilts her head, studying you with a mix of curiosity and skepticism. \"Sure, whatever you say.\" She pauses, then smirks. \"You're really not going to tell me what's up, are you?\"\n\n \"There's nothing to tell,\" you reply firmly.\n\n She stares at you for a moment longer before letting out an exaggerated sigh and flopping back onto the bed dramatically. \"Fine. Keep your secrets. But just so you know, you're terrible at lying.\"\n\n \"I'm not lying,\" you insist.\n\n \"Well, whatever it is, I'm sure it's juicy, and I'll figure it out eventually.\"\n\n Lily grins and hops off the bed. She heads toward the door \n <<if [lilyRelo] > 34>> \n , but pauses just before stepping out, glancing back at you with a softer expression.\n\n \"Hey, [name]?\"\n\n \"Yeah?\"\n\n \"Even if you're being all secretive, just... remember I'm here, okay?\"\n\n The genuine care in her tone catches you off guard.\n\n \"Thanks, Lily,\" you say quietly, giving her a quiet smile.\n\n She shrugs, her grin returning as she gives you a thumbs-up. She steps out of your room, closing the door behind her as she disappears down the hall.\n \n \n and steps out, closing it behind her.\n \n\n Left in the quiet, you reflect on Lily's words.

[name], come on—\"\n\n \"I'm serious, Lily,\" you interrupt, your voice firmer. \"It's real. The curse is why I've been changing.\"\n\n Lily blinks, her laughter fading as she studies your face. For once, she doesn't interrupt. You slowly explain, your words tumbling out faster. You struggle to find the words but find yourself opening up to Lily for the first time in a long time.\n\n \"You're serious,\" she says quietly, her eyes searching yours. She leans back slightly, her arms dropping to her sides. Her sharp energy has been replaced with something more grounded.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you reply, barely above a whisper.\n\n The silence between you feels heavy, but not oppressive. Lily looks down at her hands, her fingers twiddling as she processes what you've told her.\n\n \"I mean, are you stuck like this?\" she asks carefully, her tone not demanding but rather curious. \"Is there a way to reverse it? Do you even want to reverse it?\"\n\n <<if [acceptance] > 24>> \n The last question catches you off guard, but you're sure exactly how to answer. You don't say it out loud, but you don't want this curse, if you can even call it that, to reverse.\n <<elseif [acceptance] > 9>> \n The last question catches you off guard, and for a moment, you're not sure how to answer.

You don't say it out loud, but you'd do anything to get rid of the curse.\n \n\n \"Look, if this is really happening, you don't have to go through it alone,\" she says, her voice regaining some of its usual fire. \"I'm here.\"\n\n You glance at her, surprised by the sudden warmth in her tone.\n\n \"Don't look at me like that,\" Lily huffs. \"You're still my brother... or sister... or whatever. You're still you, [name]. That's what matters.\"\n\n \"Thanks, Lily, you say quietly.\"\n\n \"Don't thank me yet, you still owe me the full story,\" she replies, a teasing edge to her voice.\n\n For the first time in what feels like forever, the tension between you dissolves into something lighter. Whatever comes next, at least you know Lily will be there to face it with you.\n\n \n \n You hold her gaze for a moment, your mind racing for a response. The room feels heavy with her expectations, her frustration practically vibrating in the air. But instead of letting her in, you find yourself falling back on old habits.\n\n \"Wow, Lily,\" you say, your voice dripping with sarcasm. \"I didn't realize you were a detective all of a sudden. What's next? You going to write a whole report on my skincare routine, Sherlock?\"\n\n Her eyes narrow, the hurt flickering across her face so briefly you almost miss it. \"Don't start with this shit, [name],\" she snaps. \"You know I'm serious.\"\n\n You shrug, leaning back against your bed frame. \"I think you're overreacting. Maybe you're just mad because you've got nothing better to do than make up wild conspiracy theories about me. Ever thought of picking up a hobby?\"\n\n \"Wow, of course, I don't know what I expected,\" she says, her lips pressing into a thin line. \"Deflecting instead of just being honest.\"\n\n \"Maybe there's nothing to tell,\" you fire back. \"Not everything is some dramatic mystery, Lily. Some of us actually mind our own business.\"\n\n She takes a step back, her shoulders stiffening. \"You think this is about me being nosy? I'm worried about you, dumbass!\" she snaps, her voice cracking.\n\n \"Yeah, well, maybe worry about yourself instead,\" you mutter, looking away.\n\n The silence that follows is thick and suffocating. When you glance back, Lily's jaw is clenched, her eyes glimmering with something you're not sure you've seen from her before.\n\n \"Fine, then don't tell me what's going on,\" she says finally, her voice cold but trembling at the edges. \"S-Screw you, [name], I was just concerned.\"\n\n She turns on her heel, her movements stiff and deliberate as she heads for the door. She slams the door behind her as she leaves you all alone.\n\n You sit there, staring at the door, the echo of her words bouncing around in your mind. The house feels quieter now, emptier, the warmth of the evening with the squad suddenly replaced by a chill you can't quite shake. For all your sharp comebacks, you can't help but feel like you've pushed Lily further away.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

You've got this covered without me.\"\n\n She raises an eyebrow, her hands on her hips as she studies you for a moment. \"Are you sure?\" she asks, her voice playful but with a touch of genuine curiosity. \"You'd seriously be great. I mean, we're kind of desperate here, but even if we weren't, you'd still be an amazing addition.\"\n\n You chuckle, trying to brush off the suggestion. \"I appreciate the vote of confidence, but cheering's not really my thing.\"\n\n \"Alright, fine, I get it,\" Jessica says, sighing dramatically as she tosses her hair over her shoulder. She claps her hand to rally the squad, looking back at them. \"Okay, everyone, back in formation! Let's run it again. [name]'s just here to supervise, so let's give him something good to critique.\"\n\n The cheerleaders move back into their positions, a few of them throwing you quick smiles or shrugs as if to say, \"Can't blame us for trying.\"\n\n \nThe music starts up again after a few beats and the team launches into their routine. You settle back into your spot on the sidelines, crossing your arms as the cheerleaders move back into formation. The faint scent of the grass and the rhythmic thud of music playing from their small speaker set the scene. From this vantage point, it's easy to take in the intricacies of their movements—the sharp arm angles, the synchronized spins, and the way they time their jumps perfectly to the beat.\n\nJessica leads with an effortless confidence, her voice cutting through the music as she calls out directions. \"Tighter transitions! Hit those marks! Sharp angles, people!\" Her presence is commanding but not intimidating; it's encouraging, like she's driving them to do their best while still having fun.\n\nYou can't help but be impressed by how much effort goes into each move. It's not just about waving around pom-poms or smiling for the crowd. Cheerleading is athletic, precise, and intense. The team's dedication is evident, even in the little moments when they stumble or laugh at their mistakes.\n\nJessica catches your eye mid-routine and flashes a quick grin before turning back to the team. \"Let's nail this pyramid, okay? Focus!\"\n\nThe pyramid comes together again, and while it's a little wobbly, it's an improvement from before. The base cheerleaders plant their feet firmly, their arms locked as they lift the flyers into position. The top flyer hesitates but manages to pull it off, raising her arms triumphantly as the music crescendos.\n\nWhen they dismount, the team bursts into cheers and applause, their earlier frustration replaced with a sense of accomplishment. Jessica turns toward you, panting slightly but still smiling.\n\n\"Alright, be honest,\" she calls out, hands on her hips. \"How'd we do that time?\"\n\nYou offer a thumbs-up and a small smile. \"Definitely better. The pyramid looked a lot steadier.\"\n\n\"Good, because we need it perfect for tomorrow,\" Jessica replies, a fierce determination in her voice. She turns back to the squad. \"Everyone, take a break, then we'll clean up the last transition.\"\n\nThe cheerleaders break into smaller groups, grabbing their water bottles and chatting. From your spot on the sidelines, you watch the way they interact—the camaraderie, the way they encourage each other even when things don't go perfectly.\n\nFor the rest of the session, you stay on the sidelines, offering occasional feedback when Jessica asks for it. Watching them work together feels strangely engaging, and even though you're not participating, you can't help but feel a small tug of admiration for the team's determination.\n\n[Choice: Watch as they finish up]",

Awesome work today, everyone. We're in good shape for tomorrow.\"\n\nThe squad cheers lightly, their earlier frustrations replaced with a sense of accomplishment. As they all start to pack their things, Jessica turns to address the group again, her voice carrying a more casual tone now.\n\n\"So, who's in for dinner?\" she asks, tossing her clipboard into her bag. \"We're going to the usual spot.\"\n\nThe cheerleaders murmur their agreement, a few of them nodding enthusiastically. They don't say it outright, but there's an unspoken understanding that this is a squad thing—a way to bond and unwind after practice.\n\nJessica looks at you and offers a small smile of thanks. \"Thanks again for helping out, [name].

Her gratitude is genuine, but you pick up that the dinner is meant for the squad and only the squad.

The adrenaline from the game has mostly worn off, leaving you with that pleasant kind of tiredness. Oddly enough, it feels good.\n\n You slip off your shoes and sneak across the floor, being careful to avoid the creaky spots as you head for the stairs. You wince as the stairs groan under your weight, but you manage to creep down the hall and into your room.\n\n You pull on your pajamas and flop onto your bed, sinking into the soft comfort of your blankets. The sounds of the day replay in your mind, and you hate to admit it, but being a cheerleader has been... fun.\n\n <<if [adultPref] > 0>> \n As you shift in your bed, you feel a small stirring in your groin.

Something familiar, something comfortable. Something you've played a hundred times before.\n\n You see there's a new update and you ignore it. The devs spent a lot of time working on it, adding new content for the player, but you? You don't see the point in trying it out.\n\n Eventually, you shut it down. The internet, the video games, the distractions. You sit there in the quiet, realizing the game's long over by now. The stadium lights are off, the crowd's gone home, and whatever happened out there?

Win-win.\"\n\nMia claps her hands together, her excitement palpable. \"Exactly! It's nothing crazy—just some foundation, a little eyeliner, maybe some gloss. It'll totally pull your look together.\"\n\nYou glance at the box of makeup, feeling a mix of curiosity and hesitation. The cheerleaders are all looking at you expectantly, their energy infectious.\n\n\"It's up to you, though,\" Jessica adds, her tone reassuring. \"No pressure, of course.

But keep it subtle, alright?\"\n\n Jessica beams, her excitement contagious. \"Of course! Trust me, you're going to look amazing. Mia, grab the essentials!\"\n\n Mia dives into the makeup box with practiced ease. She looks at your face for a bit before pulling out a small selection of products. She gestures for you to sit on a nearby stool, and the other cheerleaders gather around, their chatter lively but encouraging.\n\n \"Okay, first things first,\" Jessica says, squeezing a small amount of lightweight cushion foundation onto a puff. \"We'll even out your skin tone. For your skin, makeup would be about making it look natural and dewy. It's just enhancing what you've already got.\"\n\n She begins dabbing the cushion foundation lightly across your face, her touch surprisingly gentle. The coolness of the product feels soothing against your skin, something you'd never experienced before.\n\n \"See? Perfect canvas,\" Mia says, watching over Jessica's shoulder. \"Your skin's already so clear. This just makes it look a little more polished.\"\n\n Next, Jessica picks up a sheer, peach-toned blush and brushes it lightly onto your cheeks. The soft strokes feel featherlight, and she adds just enough to give your complexion a subtle, healthy glow.\n\n \"Blush is key,\" she explains. \"It makes you look fresh and awake, especially with the bright lights.\"\n\n Mia hands Jessica a slim eyebrow pencil, and Jessica leans in closer. \"Your brows are great already, so just a little shaping to define them.\" She gently fills in your brows with quick, precise strokes, then brushes them into places with a spoolie.\n\n \"Almost done!\" Jessica says, grabbing a liquid eyeliner. She holds it up for a moment, a playful grin on her face. \"Just a tiny flick for a subtle wing.\"\n\n You close your eyes as she carefully lines your eyelid, the tip of the brush gliding smoothly along the edge. You can feel Jessica adding the faintest wing at the outer corner of your eyes.\n\n \"Now, last step, I swear,\" she announces, reaching for a tinted lip balm in a rosy shade. \"This'll keep your lips hydrated and add just a hint of color.\"\n\n She applies the balm and the sweet, fruity scent that drifts to your nose is faint but pleasant. The balm is barely noticeable, but it gives your lips a soft sheen that catches the light in just the right way.\n\n \"There!\" Jessica says, stepping back with a satisfied smile. \"We're all done. [name], you're officially game-day ready.\"\n\n Mia claps, her excitement radiating. \"Wait, don't look yet! Let me grab the mirror.\"\n\n You sit still, feeling the faint weight of the makeup but having no idea how it all looks together. The cheerleaders exchange smiles and whispers. While their approval is obvious, it seems they're enjoying leaving you in suspense.\n\n Mia returns with a handheld mirror, holding it just out of your reach. \"Okay, are you ready? No freaking out.\" \n\n She angles the mirror toward you, and for the first time, you feel the reflection staring back.\n\n Your skin looks smooth and radiant, the subtle blush and soft eyeliner enhancing your features without overwhelming them. The tinted lip balm adds a touch of color, tying everything together into a natural, polished look that feels like an upgraded version of yourself.\n\n <<if [transgender] > 9>> \n Your reflection feels like a revelation. The soft blush on your cheeks, the gentle flick of eyeliner, and the natural glow of your skin don't just make you look polished—they make you feel seen in a way that catches you off guard. You touch your face lightly as if to confirm the person in the mirror is really you.\n \n \"Wow,\" you murmur, the word barely audible. \n\n Jessica's grin widens, catching the shift in your expression. \"See? I knew you'd love it. You look incredible.\"\n\n Mia leans in, her voice teasing but kind. \"Told you makeup wasn't so scary. You're pulling it off better than most of us do.\"\n\n You nod slowly, still staring in the mirror. There's a warmth building in your chest—a quiet, unexpected joy that leaves you smiling softly. \"Thanks,\" you say, your voice steadier now. \"It... really does look good.\"\n\n You glance back at the mirror one last time, your reflection holding your gaze. For now, the person staring back feels like someone you could get used to seeing.\n \n \n <<if [acceptance] > 20>> \n Your reflection surprises you, but you can't help the small smile that creeps onto your face. The polished look in the mirror is striking, and while it doesn't feel like a huge transformation, it's a pleasant surprise. It feels like trying on a new outfit you didn't think would work but ends up fitting better than expected.\n\n \"Huh,\" you say, tilting your head as you study your face. \"It's not... bad.\"\n \n Jessica grins, clearly pleased. \"Not bad? Please. [name]—it's amazing, and you know it.\"\n\n Mia nods, tossing her ponytail over her shoulder. \"You look sharp, but, like, effortlessly so. People pay good money to pull off what you're doing naturally.\"\n\n You laugh lightly, handing the mirror back. \"Alright, fine. I'll admit it—it looks pretty good. Thanks for not going overboard.\"\n\n Jessica nudges your arm playfully. \"See? We know what we're doing. You're going to be the star out there tonight, trust me.\"\n\n You glance at your reflection one last time. The soft makeup is a reminder of how much you've grown lately—not just in how you look but in embracing the unexpected.\n \n \n Your reflection catches you off guard, the polished look staring back feeling more foreign than familiar. The makeup is skillfully done—there's no denying that—but it doesn't quite click in your mind as you.\n\n \"It's.. different,\" you say, your tone neutral as you tilt your head.\n\n \"Different in a good way, right?\" Jessica asks, although you can tell she's picked up on your hesitance. \"It's all about the game-day vibe. Trust me—you look awesome.\"\n\n Mia nods, her smile easy. \"Yeah, it's just makeup. Think of it like a Halloween costume or something. Just something for fun.\"\n\n You force a small smile, handing the mirror back. \"I guess, yeah. Thanks for keeping it subtle.\"\n\n Jessica pats your shoulder lightly. \"Don't overthink it. You're going to look great out there, and no one's even going to notice the makeup or recognize that it's you out there.\"\n\n You nod, although you can't help but notice their enthusiasm doesn't match your own. The makeup doesn't feel like you, but as you glance around at the squad's supportive smiles, you remind yourself that it's just for the game—and maybe that's all it needs to be.\n \n \n\n \n \"Go all in,\" you say, nodding. The cheerleaders erupt into a chorus of excitement immediately. Jessica claps her hands together while Mia practically jumps in place.\n\n \"Full glam, huh?\" Jessica asks, cracking a grin. \"Bold choice. Alright, sit tight. You're in good hands.\"\n\n She grabs a chair and gestures for you to sit down. The squad gathers around, murmuring a mix of curiosity and approval. Mia claps her hands together, practically bouncing on her toes. \"This is going to be so good. Jessica's amazing at this.\"\n\n Jessica pulls the makeup box closer, her movements confident as she selects her tools. \"Alright, [name]. Close your eyes and relax. You won't see anything until I'm done, so no peeking. Got it?\"\n\n \"Got it,\" you reply, leaning back in the chair and closing your eyes. You can feel the squad's energy buzzing around you, their chatter blending into the background as Jessica begins her work.\n\n The first touch is gentle, a cool sensation as Jessica dabs primer across your face. \"This will help everything stay put,\" she explains. \"Even with all the cheering and sweating you're going to be doing under those field lights.\"\n\n Next comes the foundation. She chooses a shade that perfectly matches your skin tone, blending it seamlessly with a damp cushion puff. \"We need to make a natural, glowing base for you,\" she says. \"We want you to look fresh, not caked up.\"\n\n The foundation feels light but silky, smoothing out your skin without making it feel heavy. Jessica applies it in thin layers, building just enough coverage to even out your complexion while maintaining a luminous finish.\n\n \"Now, we've got to do some contouring,\" she murmurs. She lightly dusts a subtle contour powder along the sides of your nose and under your cheekbones, keeping the strokes precise but minimal. \"Nothing too harsh, of course. The style of makeup I'm doing for you doesn't do heavy lines—just soft definition.\"\n\n You feel the cool bristles of a brush as she adds just a hint of blush to your cheeks, focusing on the apples and blending upward toward your temples. \"We're going for that natural flush,\" Jessica says. \"Kind of like you've just stepped out of the cold.\"\n\n \"Okay, okay, now it's time for the fun part,\" Jessica says, her tone brightening. \"Let me tell you, your eyes are going to pop.\"\n\n She starts with a neutral base, sweeping a light beige shadow across your lids. Then, she adds a soft wash of peachy-pink shimmer, blending it out into a gradient that subtly catches the light.\n\n \"Hmm, let's keep it classic for eyeliner,\" she says. You feel the gentle glide of gel eyeliner pen as she draws along your lash line, flicking it upward at the end for a wing. \"This should bring life to your eyes without looking too dramatic.\"\n\n \"Are we doing [name]'s eyelashes?\" Mia interrupts.\n\n Jessica pauses, her tone turning almost playful. \"Yeah, we have to,\" she asserts. \"Trust us when we say these will make all the difference.\"\n\n You feel her curling your lashes before applying a quick coat of mascara, keeping her touch steady and deliberate. The mascara lifts and separates each lash, giving them a fluttery look.\n\n \"We're almost there,\" Jessica says, the excitement in her voice contagious. \"Just need to finish with the lips and some final touches.\"\n\n You feel the soft glide of lip tint as she applies it to the center of your lips. She takes some time blending it outward for a gradient effect. \"This is called gradient lips, it's becoming really popular as of late. It's like a soft, natural look—like your lips have just been bitten.\"\n\n She finishes by spritzing a fine mist of setting spray over your face. \"This will keep everything in place. Now... ready to see the masterpiece?\"\n\n Jessica steps back with a flourish, setting her makeup brushes on the table like a painter who just completed a masterpiece. The squad, who had been watching, breaks into gasps and murmurs the moment they see you.\n\n \"Holy shit,\" Mia breathes, her eyes wide as she leans closer. \"[name], you look... I can't even.\"\n\n \"How is this even possible?\" Ashley chimes in. \"This is next-level.\"\n\n \"Alright, alright,\" Jessica says, waving her hand. \"Let's not inflate my ego too much. [name] deserves the credit for having great features to work with.\"\n\n Her words make your cheeks flush, although you're unsure whether it came from the compliment or the surreal nature of the moment.\n\n \"Okay, [name],\" Jessica says. \"I have a mirror right in front of you. Ready? Open your eyes.\"\n\n You take a deep breath, nerves fluttering in your chest, and slowly open your eyes.\n\n The first thing that jumps out at you is how luminous you look. Your glowing, dewy skin reflects the soft overhead lights perfectly, every pore seemingly smoothed into invisibility. Your eyes, framed by the soft shimmer of the eyeshadow and the delicate flick of the eyeliner, seem larger and more alive, drawing attention without overwhelming your features. Your lashes make them pop even more, adding depth and warmth. Your cheeks have a soft, natural flush, the blush blending seamlessly into your skin. Your lips are also perfectly tinted with a gradient that makes them look effortlessly natural yet polished.\n\n For a moment, you don't recognize the person in the mirror.\n\n <<if [transgender] > 9>> \n But then, something clicks. The soft glow of your skin, the way your eyes seem brighter, the delicate flush on your cheeks—it feels all so different, yet not wrong. It's like staring at a version of yourself that had always been there, just waiting to be brought into focus. \n\n Your breath catches slightly as you lean closer, taking in every single little detail. Everything feels like it was meant to be this way all along.\n\n You blink, trying to process the rush of emotions swirling in your chest. There's a strange but undeniable sense of relief, of something slotting into place. it's not just the makeup, not at all, it's what it hints at. For the first time, the reflection looking back at you feels like it's matching something deeper.\n\n \"[name], you good?\" Jessica's voice is gentle, breaking the quiet spell of the moment.\n\n You glance at her, seeing her expression being equal parts proud and curious. Your lips tug into a small smile, unbidden but genuine. \"Yeah,\" you say softly, your voice steady but warm. \"Yeah, I think I'm... good.\"\n\n Jessica smiles back. \"See, I told you you'd look amazing. You're a natural.\"\n\n Around you, the squad cheers and chatters. Their voices are bright and celebratory, but to you, they're just background noise to the quiet realization. The person staring back in the mirror isn't someone else. They're you. And for the first time in a long time, you like what you see.\n\n This feeling is more like an undercurrent than a flood, but it's there. And it's enough to leave you sitting a little taller.\n\n You nod, taking a deep breath as you step away from the mirror. There's still a game to prepare for—but for now, this quiet, unexpected moment of peace stays with you.\n \n \n <<if [acceptance] > 20>> \n The makeup transforms your features in ways you didn't expect, softening edges, brightening your eyes, and highlighting your best traits. It's not what you're used to, but it's... not bad.\n\n You tilt your head slightly, taking it in. The reflection staring back at you feels unfamiliar, but not unwelcome. It's like trying on a costume, a role you're not quite sure you fit yet, but one that feels surprisingly comfortable.\n\n \"You're killing it, [name],\" Jessica says, her voice breaking the silence.\n\n You glance at her, then back at the mirror, letting out a small, self-conscious laugh. \"It's different,\" you admit. \"But I think I kind of like it.\"\n\n The squad cheers, and as you catch another glimpse of yourself, you can't help but smile. Different or not, you're starting to see why they're so excited.\n \n \n It throws you off. \n\n The glowing skin, the delicate makeup, the way your features seem softer, more refined—it's almost like looking at a stranger.\n\n Your stomach knots, the unfamiliarity feeling sharp and uncomfortable. You shift in your seat, your fingers gripping the edge of the chair as you try and process the image staring back at you.\n\n \"You alright?\" Jessica asks, her tone gentle but concerned.\n\n You hesitate, forcing a small smile. \"Yeah,\" you say quietly. \"It's just... a lot.\"\n\n Jessica nods, stepping back slightly to give you space. The squad's chatter and cheers feel distant, their excitement almost overwhelming. You glance at your reflection again, struggling to reconcile what you see with how you feel, the discomfort lingering even as the team's energy tries to pull you back in.\n \n \n \n\n<<if [d12makeup] > 0>> \n As you catch your reflection in the mirror, a sudden, unmistakable warmth blooms in your chest, spreading outward like a ripple. Your heart skips, and you feel the telltale tingling in your hands and face. Panic sets in, and without a word, you push back your chair, mumbling something vague as you rush toward the gym restroom.\n \n [Choice: Transform]",

Your school has been trailing all night and the team's spirits have been wavering as the opposing team dominates. But the crowd remains energized, and the players on the field—led by Jordan, the quarterback, and Luke, the wide receiver—start to shift momentum.\n\nThe third quarter passes in tense silence, the Panthers struggling to push through the defense. But then, with just a minute left in the game, Jordan takes the ball and charges forward, weaving between defenders with sheer determination. He throws a long pass down the field, his arm strong and accurate. The crowd roars, and you feel the excitement mounting.\n\nFrom your vantage point, you spot Luke—a force of nature in his position—charging through the defense like a freight train. You knew your best friend was good at football, but actually witnessing it is a different story. He breaks through tackles, fists pumping with sheer strength until he reaches the end zone. In the final seconds, Jordan's pass lands perfectly in Luke's hands. The crowd goes wild, cheers erupting as Luke catches the ball in stride and bursts into the end zone, sealing the touchdown that shifts the game in favor of Pacific Crest.\n\nThe game clock ticks down to zero, and the entire stadium erupts in a wave of celebration. The players are swarmed by teammates, the crowd chanting their names. It's a moment of triumph, and you find yourself unable to stop smiling. The adrenaline in the air is palpable, and you get swept up in the excitement, cheering alongside the rest of the team.\n\nAs the cheerleaders join the celebration on the sidelines, Jessica grabs your arm, her eyes shining with excitement.\n\n\"We did it!\" she shouts over the roar of the crowd. \"They came through!\"\n\nYou exchange smiles with your fellow cheerleaders, feeling a deep sense of pride. Even though the game has ended, the cheering doesn't stop. The Panthers have won, and the feeling of triumph reverberates through the night. Amidst it all though, you spot Jordan walking off the field. His expression is stoic and his gaze is distant. He moves quickly, shoulders hunched as if the celebration means nothing to him. He avoids eye contact, shutting himself off from the crowd entirely as he storms off.\n\nNearby, Luke is in a different state of mind. He's laughing, clapping teammates on the back, and still riding the high of the last-second play. His wide grin shifts as he spots Samantha nearby, who's already pulling out her phone, typing away with a smirk on her face. Luke strolls over to her, standing close as he sends a quick text, unaware of your presence. Your phone buzzes and you see a simple text from Luke asking where you are. \n\nMeanwhile, Jessica is still with the other cheerleaders, laughing and celebrating the win. She throws her arms around the girls, a contagious energy radiating off of her. She's basking in the moment, soaking up all the attention as they chat about the win.\n\nYou stand there, caught between the scene unfolding around you. You wonder who you should approach.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n[Choice: Go to Jordan]\n[Choice: Go to your two best friends]\n[Choice: Go to Jessica]",

Sweat glistens on his brow, but his grin remains firmly in place as Samantha teases him about the game. She gestures animatedly, her voice carrying over the crowd.\n\n\"Come on, Luke, you seriously almost botched it in the third quarter,\" she says with an exaggerated sigh, though her tone stays playful.\n\n\"Hey, it worked out, didn't it?\" Luke shoots back with a chuckle. \"You know who really needed saving? Jordan. I'm the real hero here.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, whatever you say, Mr. Hero,\" Samantha retorts, crossing her arms with a smirk. \"We all know you just love the attention.\"\n\nLuke glances down at his phone, a concerned look crossing his face. \"Speaking of attention, [name] missed one hell of a game. I'll have to text him the play-by-play later.\"\n\nSamantha arches an eyebrow, taking a moment to glance around as if making sure no one else is listening. She leans in slightly, lowering her voice to a conspiratorial tone. You inch closer, getting just in range to eavesdrop. \"I mean, seriously, do you think he'll even care?\" she asks. \n \n \"Like, I get he's going through the curse, but he's been acting so... different. You can tell he's hiding something from us.\"\n\n \n \"I mean seriously. You've noticed, right? He's been acting so... different. Like something's been going on with him, but he won't say what. It's kinda weird.\"\n \n\nLuke shrugs, but you catch his expression darkening for a split second. \"Yeah, I've noticed that he's been skipping out on stuff,\" Luke says. \"Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if he's got some new secret project. Probably something dumb, though. [name]'s never been good at keeping stuff to himself.\"\n\n\"I guess, yeah, you're probably right,\" Samantha says, not seeming like she quite believes her own words. \"I just don't know what's keeping him so busy.\"\n\nShe trails off, staring at the crowd as if trying to figure out where you may be. \"I'm curious.

The lights from the field cast a harsh glow, and the makeup on your face feels like a mask—not just covering your skin, but cloaking your identity.\n\n As you step closer, Samantha looks up first, her sharp eyes scanning over you with curiosity. She tilts her head slightly as if trying to piece where she's seen you before. Luke follows her gaze, his brow furrowing in confusion.\n\n \"Uh, hey,\" you say, making your voice softer. The nerves bubble up, but you manage to push them down.\n\n Samantha's eyes widen for a brief moment before her face lights up with a friendly smile. \"Hey, you're one of the cheerleaders, right? You were amazing out there! That halftime routine was on point.\"\n\n Luke nods, his confusion melting into casual friendliness. \"Yeah, you guys really hyped up the crowd. I think it helped us pull through in the end. Thanks for that.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I appreciate it,\" you reply, your voice steadying. It's surreal to stand here, talking to your best friends while they have no idea who you are. The cheerleading uniform and makeup have transformed you into someone unrecognizable, even to the people who know you best.\n\n \"So, you must be new, right?\" Samantha asks, gesturing toward you. \"Jessica's been talking about adding to the squad, but I didn't think they'd find someone this good right away.\"\n\n Luke chimes in, chuckling. \"Seriously. You were killing it out there. What's your name, by the way? I haven't seen you around before.\"\n\n Your stomach flips at the question. You could play along, let the illusion hold for a little longer, or you could reveal the truth, watching their shock and disbelief unfold.\n\n [Choice: Stay anonymous]\n [Choice: Reveal yourself]\n\n \n You take a deep breath, your pulse quickening as you step closer to your two best friends, the reality of the moment sinking in.

What are you doing in a cheerleading outfit?\"\n\n You glance between the two of them, your heart pounding. The secret is out—at least part of it. They've recognized you. There's a mix of shock and curiosity on their faces, and you can't help but feel a little exposed.\n\n \"Yeah, I guess you guys weren't expecting this, huh?\" you say with a small smile, trying to keep things light despite the nerves bubbling underneath. \"I figured I'd try something different. Needed a new perspective.\"\n\n \"Cheerleading, though?\" Luke asks, obviously still processing what's happening.\n\n Samantha crosses her arms, giving you a skeptical glance. \"You're really doing this? A cheerleader? That's unexpected, even with how you've been acting lately.\" She smirks, though there's genuine curiosity behind her eyes. \"How long has this been going on, huh?\"\n\n You shift uncomfortably under their scrutiny, wondering how you should address this.\n\n [Choice: Keep it light]\n [Choice: Tell them the truth]",

The makeup, the uniform, the role you've been playing—all of it feels like armor, but the thought of keeping this secret from your best friends weighs heavily on your shoulders. Taking a deep breath, you decide to pull off the mask.\n\n \"Well...\" you begin, your voice quieter than you expected. \"It's me.\"\n\n Samantha blinks, her smile faltering as confusion flickers across her face. \"What do you mean?\" she asks, her tone measured.\n\n Luke's expression mirrors her, his brows knitting together. \"Wait, what?\"\n\n You lift a hand and brush back a strand of hair, your fingers grazing the edge of your face where the makeup feels heavier. \"It's me, [name],\" you say, letting your voice drop to its normal range.\n\n For a moment, there's nothing but the sounds of the crowd behind you and the faint crackle of the stadium lights. Then, Samantha's eyes widen in sheer disbelief.\n\n \"Wait, wait, hold on!\" she exclaims, taking a step closer and squinting at you. \"[name]? [name] Yoon? Our [name]?\"\n\n Luke's jaw drops as he stares at you, completely flabbergasted. \"No way. This has to be some kind of prank.\"\n\n \"It's not a prank,\" you say quickly. \"I'm being serious, it's me. I know I look... different, but Jessica kind of roped me into helping the cheer squad. One thing led to another and here I am.\"\n\n Samantha's face shifts from shock to a grin as she takes in your appearance again. \"Oh my God,\" she says before bursting into laughter. \"This is insane! You're cheerleading?! And you're actually good at it?!\"\n\n \"How did this happen?\" Luke asks. \"And why do you look like that?\"\n\n You shrug. \"It's a long story, but it turns out I'm good at it. Naturally talented, you can say. Jessica convinced me to join for the game tonight.\"\n\n Samantha nudges Luke with her elbow. \"Hey, don't act so surprised. [name]'s always been full of surprises after all.\" She looks back at you, her grin softening and becoming more affectionate. \"Honest, you look great. Like, it seriously suits you.\"\n\n <<if [lukeRomance] > 9>> \n Luke nods slowly, his expression caught between disbelief and something softer. \"Yeah, uh... I guess you do. Look great, I mean.\" His voice lowers just a touch. \"This is wild, though. You're not about to tell us you're switching careers to cheerleading, are you?\"\n\n He let's out a light laugh, but it's different—almost like he's searching for a way to ease the tension.\n \n \n \"Yeah, I guess you do,\" Luke says, though it's clear he's still processing. He laughs and shakes his head, trying to make the situation lighter. \"You're not about to tell us you're switching careers to cheerleading, are you?\"\n \n\n \"Not yet,\" you reply, a sheepish smile on your face.\n\n \"Well, whatever this is, you better tell us everything later,\" Samantha says. \"Like every single detail.\"\n \n \n You hesitate for a moment, the words teetering on the edge of your tongue. But something holds you back. You don't know if it's the thrill of being seen in a different light or the curiosity to see how they interact with you. Whatever the reason, you make the split-second decision to keep your identity hidden.\n\n \"Oh, yeah, I just joined recently,\" you say, flashing them a warm smile. \"Jessica's been really great about helping me catch up.\"\n\n \"Well, you're already killing it,\" Samantha says, clearly curious about the new face in the cheerleading squad. \"You were flawless. I'd be falling flat on my face if I tried half the things you were able to pull off.\"\n\n \"Seriously,\" Luke adds, his easy grin making the whole situation feel oddly normal. \"It's cool to see how much energy you guys bring. It really amps up the team.\"\n\n You nod, your smile tightening slightly. If only he knew.\n\n \"Are you planning to stick with cheerleading?\" Samantha asks. \"I don't know how long you've been practicing, but it feels like you've got real potential.\"\n\n \"Maybe. It has been a lot of fun so far, after all.\"\n\n Samantha glances at Luke, a playful glint in her eyes. \"You should try it, Luke. You've really got the height for stunting. It would help the cheerleading squad if you joined and threw people in the air.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I'm good,\" Luke snorts. \"I'll leave that to the professionals. I'd probably drop someone on their head anyway.\"\n\n The familiar banter makes you feel a little more at ease, though the surrealness of the moment isn't lost on you. Here you are, talking to your closest friends, and they're treating you like a stranger.\n\n \"Anyway, we should probably head back to find our friend,\" Samantha says, checking her phone. \"He's probably wandering around somewhere, lost as always.\"\n\n \"Yeah, see you around,\" Luke says, cutting the conversation.\n\n As they turn to leave, you feel a strange mix of relief and disappointment. For now, the secret remains yours.\n \n\n \n \n \n \n You let out a long breath, deciding there's no point in hiding it anymore. They've already seen you, and pretending otherwise won't change anything. Looking at Luke and Samantha, a bewildered expressions on their faces, you realize they deserve an explanation—your friends always do.\n\n \"Yeah, this is me,\" you admit, gesturing to the cheerleading uniform. \"I've been... helping out the squad.\"\n\n \"Helping out?\" Samantha echoes, her voice tinged with disbelief. \"What the fuck [name], you're in uniform. You're not just 'helping out.' You're part of the team.\"\n\n Luke stares at you like he's trying to connect the dots. \"Wait, hold on. You've actually been out here—on the sidelines, cheering—for how long? We didn't even notice.\"\n\n \"Well, it's not like I was trying to advertise it,\" you reply with a shrug. \"But yeah, I've been practicing with the team lately. Today was my first game.\"\n\n Samantha's eyes widen, and she points a finger at you. \"Your first game?\" she says, her voice rising. \"[name], how does that even happen? You don't just join the cheerleading team overnight.\"\n\n You rub the back of your neck, feeling the weight of the moment. \"It just... kind of did happen overnight. They needed someone to fill in and I thought it'd be temporary, but it turns out I'm actually good at it.\"\n\n Luke finally snaps out of his stunned silence and laughs, shaking his head. \"Good at it? Dude, you were out there in front of the whole school.\"\n\n Samantha steps closer, her expression shifting from shock to something more thoughtful. \"I've got to say, I'm kind of impressed,\" she admits. \"I never thought I'd see you pulling off stunts and chants, but... you did. And you looked like you belonged out there too.\"\n\n \"Thanks, I guess,\" you say, offering a sheepish smile.\n\n Luke shakes his head again, clearly still processing the revelation. \"This is wild. I don't even know what to say. But, are you sure about this? Like you're really okay being out there in that?\" He gestures at the uniform again, his tone softer now, almost protective.\n\n <<if [trans] > 14 or [acceptance] > 19>> \n You glance down at the uniform, your mind flashing back to the hours of practice, the energy of the crowd, and the way the cheerleaders welcomed you like one of their own. \"Yeah,\" you say, meeting their eyes. \"It's weird, I know. But it feels... right, somehow.\"\n \n \n You glance down at the uniform, your fingers fidgeting nervously with the hem. The hours of practice, the roar of the crowd, and the cheerleaders' easy camaraderie flicker through your mind—but instead of comfort, it leaves you with a tangled knot of uncertainty. \"I don't know,\" you admit, your voice quieter. \"It's weird, and I guess it just happened. I'm still figuring it out.\"\n \n\n Samantha smiles, giving a teasing nudge. \"Who are we to judge though, right? You were pretty great right there anyway.\"\n\n Luke grins, the surprise in his eyes softening into something warmer. \"You've always had a way of surprising people, I guess I should've expected this.\"\n \n \n \n \n You force a casual, adjusting the hem of your cheerleading top in an attempt to seem unbothered. \"Oh, you know, just trying something new,\" you say with a shrug, as if stepping into a cheerleading uniform and performing at a football game was the most normal thing in the world. \"Figured it couldn't hurt to mix things up a bit.\"\n\n Luke raises an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced. \"Mix things up?\" he asks. \"Dude, this isn't something small. You're literally in a cheerleading uniform. That's a bit more than 'mixing things up.'\"\n\n Samantha, on the other hand, seems more intrigued than anything. She tilts her head, her smirk softening. \"So, what, did Jessica rope you into this? Or did you wake up one morning and think 'You know what I really need? A pom-pom in each hand.'\"\n\n You chuckle nervously, scratching the back of your neck. \"Let's just say... circumstances led me here,\" you reply cryptically, keeping your tone light. \"Hey, I'm not half-bad at it either, apparently.\"\n\n <<if [lukeRomance] > 9>> \n Luke crosses his arms, shaking his head with an amused huff. \"Man, I can't believe I didn't recognize you out there. You were... what's the word?\" He pauses, his gaze flickering to the uniform for a split second before quickly looking away. \"Uh, energetic. Yeah, that's it. Energetic. I guess you're actually... pretty good at this.\"\n \n \n Luke crosses his arms and lets out an amused huff. \"Man, I can't believe I didn't recognize you, [name],\" Luke says. \"You did pretty good, I've got to give you props.\"\n \n\n \"Thanks... I think?\" you reply with a grin.\n\n Samantha steps forward, leaning in. \"So, are you gonna tell us why you really did this, or are you just gonna keep being all mysterious and stuff?\"\n\n You glance between the two of them, weighing your response. \"Let's just say it's been an interesting day,\" you finally say, dodging the question with a practiced vagueness.\n\n Samantha rolls her eyes. \"Fine, keep your secrets.\"\n\n \"Whatever, man,\" Luke says, shaking his head.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Especially when you consider this was your first game. You were just...amazing. I told you you'd fit right in.\"\n\nMia nudges her and giggles. \"Yeah, he was our secret weapon.\"\n\nJessica laughs and rolls her eyes. \"Come on, he's not a secret weapon; he's one of us,\" she says, winking and pulling you further into the group. \"You really are a part of the squad now. This is what it's all about.\"\n\nAll the cheerleaders include you in their excitement, the shared energy making you feel more like a member of the team than ever. Jessica leans in slightly, just enough to not be noticeable. \"I'm really glad you decided to join us,' Jessica whispers. \"You've got a knack for this, and it's been fun having you around.\"\n\nEven if it's just for tonight, you've found a place to belong.\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

The two of you head toward the quieter edge of the field, away from the excited chatter and bright stadium lights. The glow from the game still flickers in the distance, but now it's just the two of you, standing under the dim lights lining the sidelines.\n\nJessica lets out a soft sigh, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. \"First off, I just wanted to say thanks. For joining us tonight, I mean. I was a little nervous about how things would go, to be honest.\" She pauses, her fingers brushing against her arm as if she's hesitant to keep talking. \"We've had new faces before, and sometimes... well, it doesn't always work out. But you? You've really made all the difference.\"\n\n\"Honestly, I was scared,\" she admits, biting her lips for a moment before continuing. \"I didn't want the squad to mess up. I didn't want to feel like I let everyone down, you know? You've made me feel better about all this, though. Like maybe, just maybe, we've got something good here.\"\n\nShe gives you a small, thankful smile, her tone steady but carrying a quiet vulnerability. \"It's been really nice having you with us.

Maybe we can hang out more—just you and me. It's nice talking like this\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head slightly, surprised by your boldness, but her reaction isn't wholly dismissive. Instead, she chuckles lightly and shakes her head. \"You're pretty sweet,\" she murmurs, shifting on her feet. \"It's... nice of you to say that.\"\n\n \"I mean, you've been doing so much, leading this whole group,\" you continue, giving her a small smile. \"You don't need to carry everything on your own, though. You've got some help now.\"\n\n \"It's not that simple,\" Jessica says, frowning slightly at your words. She folds her arms and looks away, exhaling softly. \"Everyone's relying on me, I can't just let them down.\"\n\n You instinctively step a little closer—just enough to let her feel your presence, without pushing. \"I get it. It's okay to let some things go and not carry everything alone though.\"\n\n Jessica shifts slightly, and for a moment, you can almost feel the tension in her body. She looks back toward you, her expression unreadable for a heartbeat—then suddenly, she gives a soft smile, though it doesn't quite reach her eyes. \"Thanks... I guess it's just good to talk to someone who gets it.\"\n\n You smile back, but before you can respond further, she takes a step back, glancing at the rest of the group. \"Well, I should head back. Don't want to make them think I'm ditching them to be with you, you know?\"\n \n \n \n \"I'm glad I could help too, it's been fun,\" you say softly. You glance at her, your eyes lingering just a second longer than normal, and something about the moment feels different. \"I really appreciate being welcomed like I was.\"\n\n Jessica's eyes soften as she watches you, her expression uncertain but clearly intrigued. She takes a half-step closer, tilting her head as she studies you—something about your appearance catches her attention.\n\n \"You look different today,\" she comments softly, her voice barely above a whisper. \"You look... like, well... You look like you belong here, like you fit in perfectly. But it's still kind of different. It's confusing, honestly.\"\n\n You let out a soft laugh, the tension in her words easing. \"I guess I'm a bit complicated, huh?\" you shift slightly, tilting your head as you catch her watching you. \"But... I wouldn't mind if you want to figure me out.\"\n\n Jessica's lips part slightly, and she looks at you for a moment longer than before, her eyes warm but cautious. \"Yeah, I think I'd like that a lot,\" she says, shifting ever so slightly closer. \"You're different from anyone I've ever met, and not just with how you act. It's more than that.\"\n\n There's an unspoken tension between you two—light, but undeniable—and for a second, it feels like the world narrows to just the two of you. Her eyes linger on yours as she searches, trying to piece together her feelings.\n \n But before she can say anything else, she pulls away, taking a breath to gather herself. \"What am I saying, I'm being too corny, huh?\" Jessica says, shaking her head and forcing a laugh. \"Let's get back to the team now.\"\n\n Jessica turns, starting to make her way back to the squad. Suddenly, she looks back at you over her shoulder. \"But... we should definitely talk more,\" she adds. \"I want to get to know you better.\"\n \n\n \n \"Of course,\" you say, giving her a reassuring smile and keeping your tone light. \"I'm just glad I could be a part of it, today was fun. We really kept the energy up.\"\n\n \"Yeah, it was fun, wasn't it?' she agrees, her eyes softening. She doesn't push the conversation any further, shifting slightly. \"We're lucky to have you. I was a little worried at first—about messing up the routine or having it all fall apart. But it worked out okay.\"\n\n You offer a nod, keeping things light. \"i just followed your lead, so credit to you and the squad for making it work.\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head slightly, a thankful expression on her face. \"Thanks,\" she murmurs. \"It means a lot that you're here helping out. You're a part of the team now.\"\n\n Before she pulls away, she adds with a playful smirk. \"We should definitely hang out more once things settle down, [name]. You're cool, did anyone tell you that?\"\n\n \"Sounds good,\" you say. \"Let's do that.\"\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

He glances your way, his expression blank for a second before flicking briefly to the cheerleading uniform you have on. He squints, some curiosity in his eyes, but it's gone just as quickly as it appeared. He doesn't recognize you.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asks, his tone clipped and neutral.\n\n\"I just wanted to say, that was an amazing game,\" you say, keeping your voice light. \"That last play—you really pulled it off.\"\n\nJordan's jaw tightens, and he lets out a breath that's almost a scoff. \"It wasn't just me,\" he mutters. \"Luke was there too.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but you're the quarterback,\" you say. \"You made the throw.\"\n\nJordan doesn't respond for a moment. His footsteps slow slightly as if debating whether to continue the conversation or just walk away. Finally, he stops, turning toward you. His expression is hard to read, but his sharp eyes study you, trying to place you.\n\n\"You're one of the cheerleaders, right?\" he asks, his tone still detached but tinged with a faint curiosity. \"I don't think I've seen you around before.

But something pushes you to answer honestly.\n\n \"It's me, [name],\" you say, your voice steady despite the nerves thrumming beneath the surface. \"I've just... been helping out.\"\n\n For a moment, there's no reaction. Jordan blinks, his head tilting slightly as the realization sinks in. His eyes flick down to your cheerleading uniform again, this time with recognition rather than confusion. He doesn't seem shocked, just curious.\n\n \"Huh,\" he mutters, crossing his arms over his chest. \"So it is you.\"\n\n You brace yourself for a comment, maybe even a harsh one, but Jordan doesn't say anything for a moment. He just studies you with a steady gaze, his expression remaining neutral. Finally, he lets out a breath, his posture relaxing slightly.\n\n \"Well, that explains the voice,\" he says, almost to himself. \"I thought I recognized it. Just... didn't expect you to be out there cheering.\"\n\n \"Yeah, it's a long story,\" you say, trying to laugh it off. \"I kind of ended up on the team by accident, but it's been interesting.\"\n\n Jordan nods slowly. \"Interesting's one way to put it,\" he says. \"I didn't know you had moves like that.\"\n\n It's almost a compliment, and it catches you off guard. You weren't expecting him to take this so casually—or to acknowledge your cheerleading skills.\n\n \"Thanks,\" you manage, unsure what else to say. \"I've, uh, been practicing a lot.\"\n\n Jordan shrugs, letting his gaze drift to the ground for a brief second before meeting yours again. \"Well, you didn't embarrass yourself out there. That's more than what I can say for some people.\"\n\n You laugh softly, unsure if he's joking or not. There's a pause, the noise of the crowd far behind you now as the two of you stand just outside the locker room.\n\n \"So, let me ask you this, why'd you really come over here?\" Jordan asks, his voice low but not unfriendly. \"Was it just to say 'good game,' or is there something else?\"\n\n [Choice: Push and ask Jordan what's up]\n [Choice: Respect his boundaries]\n\n \n You pause, caught off guard by how direct Jordan is with his question. His gaze is sharp as if he's trying to solve a puzzle that doesn't quite fit together.\n\n \"Oh, I'm just new to the squad,\" you say with a shrug, keeping your tone light. \"Jessica asked me to fill in since they were short a cheerleader. it's been pretty fun so far.\"\n\n Jordan narrows his eyes, and his head tilts just enough to make it clear he's not buying it. \"New, huh?\" he repeats, his voice calm but laced with skepticism. \"Funny, I thought I knew everyone on the cheer team. You're saying you just showed up out of nowhere and got tossed into a routine like that?\"\n\n You swallow, your brain scrambling for something, anything, to patch up the growing cracks in your story. \"Well, I've been practicing on my own for a bit,\" you offer weakly. \"Jessica said I had potential, so... she fast-tracked me for tonight.\"\n\n Jordan fully faces you. His expression doesn't shift much—still calm—but there's an edge to it, a quiet intensity that stings more than any raised voice. \"Practicing on your own,\" he repeats slowly, as though testing the weight of your words. \"And Jessica, who takes cheerleading more seriously than most people take their careers, just decided to throw you in the first game of the season? Right.\"\n\n You try to hold his gaze, but it's like staring into an open flame. \"It's really not a big deal,\" you say, laughing nervously. \"I'm just here to help out. That's all.\"\n\n Jordan's lips press into a thin line, and for a moment, you think he might let it slide. Instead, he exhales sharply, a short, humorless laugh escaping as he shakes his head. \"You're a terrible liar, you know that?\"\n\n Your stomach drops. Jordan doesn't look away, his piercing gaze pinning you in place. \"You know,\" he says, \"I can't stand it when people lie to me.\"\n\n His words hit harder than you expect, carrying a weight that makes your throat tighten. \"It's not—I'm not lying,\" you stammer, trying to salvage the situation, but it's clear you're not convincing anyone.\n\n Jordan lets out a short, humorless laugh. \"Yeah, sure,\" he says, crossing his arms. \"Look, I get it. You've got your reasons or whatever. But if you think you can just spin me some story and I won't notice, you clearly don't know me.\"\n\n The harshness of his words makes you flinch, but it's not just his tone—it's the undercurrent of disappointment beneath it that twists the knife. It's like he's not even angry, just... done.\n\n \"Here's the thing,\" he continues. \"I don't care who you are or what you're doing here. But lying? That's a waste of time—for both of us.\"\n\n He turns away, taking a few steps toward the locker room before glancing over his shoulder, his expression unreadable. \"Next time, try being honest. It's a lot easier.\"\n\n With that, he walks off, leaving you standing there, the weight of his words settling uncomfortably in your stomach.\n\n [Choice: Continue]",

He doesn't seem hostile, just guarded, like someone who's learned to keep his cards close to his chest.\n\n \"I mean it, Jordan,\" you say, your tone calm but earnest. \"You were incredible out there, yeah, but I get the feeling this isn't just about the game.\"\n\n Jordan's eyes narrow slightly in quiet suspicion. He shifts his weight, crossing his arms again. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n You shrug, keeping your posture relaxed and your voice light. \"I don't know,\" you say. \"You just walked off, right after a huge win. Most people would be celebrating with the team, but you didn't.\"\n\n His jaw tightens, and for a moment you think you may have pushed too far. Then he sighs, looking away. \"Yeah, well, not everyone needs to stick around for the pep talks and back-slapping,\" he mutters. \"Some of us have better things to do.\"\n\n \"Better things to do, or things you're avoiding?\" you ask gently.\n\n Your question catches him off guard. He glances at you, his expression flickering for just a second. Whether it's surprise, frustration, or even relief, you're not sure which. But it's gone just as quickly, replaced by his usual mask.\n\n \"What would you even know about it?\" he asks, as if he's challenging you.\n\n You take a step closer, just enough to show you're not backing down while not invading his space. \"I can't say I know you, but I do know what it's like to feel the weight of expectations on your shoulders,\" you say. \"It's not really about the game, is it? It's about what happens after. About what people say and expect.\"\n\n Jordan's eyes meet yours, and for the first time, there's a crack in his armor. He doesn't nod or confirm anything, but his silence speaks volumes.\n\n He looks away again after a moment, letting his hands drop to his sides. \"You think you've got me all figured out, huh?\" he says. There's no venom in his words though, only a tired resignation.\n\n \"Not even,\" you admit. \"But I know enough to tell when someone's carrying a lot more than they should have to.\"\n\n Jordan lets out a breath that's almost like a laugh, but its dry and humorless. \"It's nothing, alright?\" he says, but his voice wavers just enough for you to catch the lie. \"I'm just glad it's over. That's all.\"\n\n He doesn't elaborate, but you can tell the wall he's built around himself are lowering just enough for you to peek over.\n\n \"You know, it's not that I hate football,\" he says suddenly, surprising even himself. \"I don't. It's just... when you've got people breathing down your neck all the time, telling you what you should be, what you have to be...\"\n\n He trails off, shaking his head. \"Let's just say winning makes things a lot easier. It keeps people off my back for a while.\"\n\n Jordan stares at you for a long moment, his expression caught between frustration and relief.\n\n \"Man, I'm really out here oversharing with a cheerleader,\" he mutters, more to himself than you. \"What the hell am I doing?\"\n\n You don't say anything at first, letting the silence settle between you. Jordan runs a hand through his hair, and his posture stiffens again.\n\n \"Look, [name], just forget I said anything, alright?\" Jordan says, his voice a little sharper. He glances at you out of the corner of his eye, his smirk faint but forced. \"Guess the post-game adrenaline got to me or something. Don't go thinking this means we're best friends now.\"\n\n Before you can respond, he takes a step back toward the locker room door, his movements quick and deliberate. \"Anyway, thanks for the... pep talk or whatever,\" he says. \"I'll see you around.\"\n\n And just like that, he's gone. Jordan disappears through the heavy locker room door without another word. The clang of it closing echoes faintly in the hallway, leaving you standing there alone.\n\n As you turn back toward the field, you can't help but wonder if this is the start of something new or if it was just a fleeting moment he'll pretend never happened. Either way, you're sure of one thing: there's a lot more to him than he lets on.\n \n \n \n You hesitate for a moment, unsure of how to say what's on your mind. Jordan's gaze almost feels like it's boring into you, and the words catch in your throat. But you've already decided to ask, so you take a shaky breath and dive in—awkwardly.\n\n \"Well, I mean... it's just... you always seem, uh... like, distant? Or something?\" you blurt out, wincing at your own phrasing. \"Like, not in a bad way! Just, you know, like... are you okay?\"\n\n Jordan blinks, his eyebrows raising slightly. The silence that follows is heavy and uncomfortable. You realize just how clumsy your words sound, but there's no taking them back now.\n\n \"What?\" he says, his tone flat.\n\n You scramble to clarify, your voice stumbling over itself. \"I just meant, like, you were so great out there tonight! But, uh, you kind of left right away. I just thought... maybe there's something bothering you? I'm just kind of curious.\"\n\n Jordan stares at you, his expression unreadable, but there's an edge to his posture now—his shoulders tense and his jaw tightens.\n\n \"I'm fine,\" he says, his tone cool.\n\n You try and salvage it, panicking slightly. \"Oh, yeah, no, of course!\" you say, your words coming out faster than you can think. \"You see, I wasn't saying you're not fine. I was just asking if you were... Never mind. Forget I said anything.\"\n\n The corner of Jordan's mouth twitches, but it's not a smile—it's something closer to irritation, or maybe disbelief. He exhales sharply through his nose, shaking his head.\n\n \"Look,\" he says firmly. \"I don't know what you're trying to get at, But I'm good. Really. I don't need a cheerleader trying to psychoanalyze me, alright?\"\n\n Your face flushes hot, and you feel like shrinking into the floor. \"Right,\" you mumble, wishing you could just disappear.\n\n Jordan studies you for a moment longer, and his expression softens by a fraction. \"Anyway... thanks for the compliment. About the game, I mean.\"\n\n He turns and walks into the locker room, leaving you standing there, feel-ing like you just made a complete fool of yourself.\n\n As the door swings shut behind him, you let out a long breath. That did not go how you planned.\n \n\n \n \n You hesitate, sensing that pushing further might not be the right move here. Jordan's body language is guarded—his arms crossed, his stance firm, and his eyes narrowed, as if he's keeping you at an arm's length away.\n\n \"No, that's it,\" you say, offering a small smile. \"I just wanted to say good game. You were incredible out there. I mean it.\"\n\n There's something softer in Jordan's expression as he looks at you for a fleeting moment. Not quite a smile, but a hint of acknowledgment. He uncrosses his arms, shifting his weight slightly, and gives a curt nod.\n\n \"Thanks,\" he says simply. He keeps it brief but there's no mistaking the sincerity behind it.\n\n You take a small step back, giving him space. \"I'll let you get going then,\" you add. \"Probably want me to get out of your hair.\"\n\n Jordan glances toward the doors and then back at you. \"Yeah,\" he mutters. \"Maybe.\"\n\n The silence that follows isn't awkward, rather feeling like the moment is reaching it's natural end. Before you turn to leave, you catch an almost imperceptible change in his expression. His shoulders drop slightly, and his jaw isn't as tight.\n\n \"See you around, [name],\" he says, and this time, his tone isn't as cold as before. There's even the faintest hint of warmth, a quiet recognition that you'd respected his boundaries.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you reply, stepping back with a small wave. \"See you.\"\n\n As you walk away, you can't help but feel a little proud of yourself. Not just for making it through the game but for handling the conversation with care. Jordan might not be the most open person, but it feels like you made a connection. A small one, sure, but it's a start.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

I'll come.\"\n\n The reaction is instant.\n\n \"Yesss!\" Jessica cheers.\n\n \"I knew you'd say yes,\" Mia says with a grin, lightly nudging your arm.\n\n \"Smart choice,\" Ashley adds. \"You'll thank us later.\"\n\n \"Alright, the cheer squad at the great Jessica residence!\" Tori announces.\n\n Jessica claps her hands again. \"Okay, here's the plan. Everyone grab your stuff from the locker room, then meet in the parking lot. We'll carpool to my place.\"\n\n [Choice: Go to Jessica's house]\n\n \n \n \n \n \n You take a deep breath, glancing at the excited faces around you. As much as you want to keep the energy going though, a quiet part of you craves some time to yourself. The day has been a whirlwind—practice, the game, the adrenaline of performing. It all feels like a lot to process.\n\n \"Actually, I think I'm gonna head home,\" you say, offering a small smile. \"I'm wiped. Seriously.\"\n\n Jessica's expression falters for a moment, but she recovers quickly. \"Oh, totally! I get it, it has been a long day. You've earned some rest.\"\n\n \"Next time, though, you have to come,\" Mia says. \"We're not letting you off the hook again. That's a promise.\"\n\n \"We'll just drag you out of your house if we have to,\" Tori adds, her tone playful.\n\n \"Deal,\" you say with a laugh, raising your hands in mock surrender. \"Next time, for sure.\"\n <<if [jessicaRelo] > 49>> \n\n Jessica steps forward, placing a hand on your shoulder. \"Seriously, though, you were amazing today. Thanks for being a part of this—it wouldn't have been the same without you.\"\n \n \"Yeah, what she said,\" Ashley chimes in in agreement. \"You're stuck with us now, [name]. Better get used to it.\"\n \n\n You turn to leave, feeling a pang of warmth at their words. They're a good group, for sure, and it's clear they genuinely want you around. But as you walk away from Pacific Crest, the buzz of the crowd fading behind you, you feel a sense of relief in the quiet.\n\n [Choice: Go home early]",

The squad, seated in a loose circle, halts their conversation mid-laugh.\n\n \"Hey, where'd you disappear to?\" Mia asks, tilting her head curiously. \"We thought you bailed on us for a second.\"\n\n Before you can respond, Jessica steps in, her tone light but pointed. \"[name] just needed a moment, right?\" she meets your gaze, her expression carefully neutral but understanding.\n\n You nod quickly, grateful for the lifeline. \"Yeah, I just needed to freshen up a bit. Didn't mean to worry anyone.\"\n\n Mia raises an eyebrow but seems to buy it. \"Well, good,\" she says. \"You've got us all hyped up for the game—you can't just leave us hanging now.\"\n\n Jessica shoots you a subtle look, her eyes scanning your face briefly as if checking to make sure you're okay. She gives you a small, reassuring smile before stepping back to the group. \"Alright, let's refocus, everyone. [name]'s here, and we've got a game to prep for. Let's crush it.\"\n\n The cheerleaders quickly return to their chatter, and you can feel Jessica's quiet support lingering in the background, her awareness of the [referto] a steady source of comfort.\n \n \n When you return to the group, you immediately feel their eyes on you.\n\n \"Woah, were'd you run off to?\" Mia asks, crossing her arms. \"You were gone forever.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" Ashley adds, frowning slightly. \"We thought you were skipping out on us or something.\"\n\n \"I wasn't skipping,\" you say quickly, trying to sound casual. \"Just needed a moment to myself. That's all.\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow, her expression curious. \"Are you alright? You seemed fine before you left.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" you reply, waving it off. \"Just nerves, I guess. Big game and all.\"\n\n The squad exchanges a few glances, but Mia shrugs. \"Fair enough. Just don't disappear on us during the game, okay? We need you out there.\"\n\n Jessica nods, her tone light as she steps in. \"Alright, no more mystery trips. We've got a routine to perfect, and you're a part of it, [name]. Let's get back to it.\"\n\n The group quickly shifts focus, the earlier concern fading as they dive back into their preparations. You exhale quickly, relieved that no one pressed too hard, though you can't shake the feeling that Jessica's eyes lingered on you just a little longer than the others.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

The conversation starts off light but it doesn't take long before Mia steers the topic to familiar territory.\n\n\"Alright, you know what we haven't done in a while?\" she asks. \"Talk about boys. It'll help loosen the mood before we start practicing.\"\n\nShe earns a chorus of laughs and a few groans from the group.\n\n\"Mia, really?\" Jessica says, raising an eyebrow. \"Can we ever go one practice without your obsession with high school's most mediocre love lives?\"\n\n\"Hey,\" Mia fires back, sitting up straight. \"First of all, it's called team bonding. Second of all, this isn't just about me—it's about all of us. That includes [name].\"\n\n\"Don't drag him into this,\" Jessica says, her expression amused.\n\nMia waves her off. \"Come on, it's harmless fun. It's not like he's got anything better to do right now. It's squad bonding.\" She turns her attention back to the group, clapping her hands. \"Alright, let's start with the basics. On a scale of one to then, how cute is Kyle?\"\n\n\"Kyle Foreman?\" Ashley scoffs, shaking her head. \"Come on. He's, like, a solid five. Maybe a six on a good day, I'll give him that.\"\n\n\"Five?\" Mia gasps, clutching her chest in horror. \"Did you see him in gym last week? Come on, he's got to be at least an eight.\"\n\n\"Okay, what about Trevor though?\" Tori asks. \"He's tall, he swims, and he's got the whole 'quiet and mysterious' vibe going on. I like it.\"\n\n\"Trevor?\" Ashley says, tilting her head in thought. \"He's not bad, I guess. But he always smells like chlorine and Old Spice. Like constantly. It's a no from me.\"\n\n\"Chlorine builds character,\" Tori whines.\n\nThe conversation continues, each cheerleader throwing out names of boys from school with exaggerated praise or overly critical commentary. They laugh and tease each other, their banter lighthearted. As the conversation buzzes around her though, Jessica leans back, her smile polite but her focus clearly elsewhere.\n\nAs if sensing an opportunity, Mia turns to you with a playful grin. \"Alright, [name], your turn. Which boy has caught your eye?

Not fake-sweet like some guys.\"\n\n \"Right?\" Mia chimes in, nodding enthusiastically. \"He's got the whole boy-next-door thing going on too. Plus, have you seen his arms? Like, wow.\"\n\n You can't help but laugh nervously, scratching the back of your neck. \"You guys are reading into this way too much. He's just... I don't know, a solid choice, I guess.\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow. \"Solid choice is right. Luke's one of the few guys on the team who doesn't act like he's king of the school. He's decent.\"\n\n \"Decent?\" Ashley echoes, shooting Jessica a scandalized look. \"He's perfect! If you're into him, [name], I say go for it.\"\n\n \"Okay, woah,\" you say, holding up your hands. \"It's really not like that. I just... I don't know. You asked, and his name came to mind.\"\n\n You get teased, but it's lighthearted and good-natured. Deep down, you can't help but feel a flicker of warmth at how highly everyone thinks of your best friend.\n\n \n \n \n You hesitate for a moment before answering, \"Vincent?\"\n\n The room goes quiet for a beat before Mia bursts out laughing, not out of cruelty but genuine surprise. \"Vincent? As in the guy with the glasses who always has his nose in some sci-fi or fantasy book?\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head, her expression curious. \"Interesting choice. He's definitely... different. But I could see it. He's kind of cute in his own way.\"\n\n \"Wait, you know Vincent?\" Ashley asks, leaning forward, her eyes sparkling with interest. \"Like, you actually talk to him?\"\n\n You nod, feeling a little self-conscious. \"Yeah, he's quiet but actually really nice. He doesn't really draw attention to himself though.\"\n\n \"Yeah, Vincent isn't the type to make a big deal about himself,\" Jessica says with a knowing smile. \"He's more of a 'stay in his lane' kind of guy. But now I'm curious.\"\n\n \"Yeah, [name], now you've got us all intrigued,\" Ashley giggles. \"Maybe we'll have to go check out this Vincent guy sometimes.\"\n\n You laugh nervously, feeling that the spotlight is shining too brightly on you. \"It's not like that! I just think he's cool. That's all.\"\n\n Jessica smirks but doesn't push further. \"Alright, we'll back off. For now.\"\n\n \n \n \n \"Maybe... Jordan?\" you say.\n\n As soon as you mention his name, the cheerleaders all exchange knowing glances. A few even lean in slightly, clearly intrigued by your choice. Mia's eyes sparkle with excitement as she raises an eyebrow.\n\n \"Jordan?\" she asks, her voice tinged with disbelief and intrigue. \"You really like him?\"\n\n Jessica smirks, leaning back slightly. \"Well, Jordan's... something else. He's quiet, keeps to himself, and never lets anyone near him. Definitely mysterious.\"\n\n Ashley giggles. \"You've got guts, [name]. Most people can't even talk to him without tripping over their own words.\"\n\n <<if [jordanRelo] > 9>> \n A small smile tugs at your lips as you think back to the exchanges you've had with Jordan. He wasn't like the others—he didn't seem interested in shallow small talk. But there was something different about the way he listened. He had this calm confidence, but under that, you could sense a certain vulnerability.\n\n The cheerleaders exchange glances once again, and Jessica raises an eyebrow. \"You've already talked to him? How'd that go?\" she asks, leaning forward slightly. The others seem curious too, watching you with heightened interest.\n\n You take a breath, feeling the weight of their attention. \"It's different,\" you finally say, choosing your words carefully. \"He's not like anyone else I've met. There's something about him that's harder to figure out.\"\n\n \"Hey, if you've already made contact, you've got a head start,\" Jessica says, tilting her head thoughtfully. \"Maybe you can be the first one to get through that shell of his.\"\n \n \n You glance away for a moment, unsure how to respond. You realize you haven't had any real interactions with Jordan yet. He's distant, keeps to himself, and whenever he walks by, it feels like there's this invisible barrier between him and everyone else.\n\n Jessica leans in slightly, her eyes narrowing in curiosity. \"Haven't talked to him yet, huh? Hmm.. well you'll get your chance soon. He's always around, especially on game days. Just remember—he doesn't give his time away easily.\"\n\n \"You've got to wonder what's going on behind those quiet eyes,\" Mia mutters.\n \n\n As the conversation turns back to other boys, you can't shake the thought—what if Jordan is different, and this is your chance to find out?\n\n \n \n \n \"Jessica,\" you blurt out.\n\n <<if [d12makeup] > 0 and [transgender] > 14>> \n \n \n The squad bursts into laughter, but Jessica's lips curve into a soft, amused smile. Her eyes glance over you briefly, as if assessing something new—something she hadn't quite noticed before. \n \n The subtle hint of makeup on your face has drawn attention to your features in a way that catches her off guard.\n \n \n The full makeup on your face has transformed your features, softening your appearance. Jessica seems to be caught off guard, leaving her momentarily speechless.\n \n\n She tilts her head slightly after a second, her gaze lingering just a second longer than it should, before clearing her throat and forcing herself to look away. \"Well, well,\" she says playfully, but with an added layer of softness to her voice. \"It looks like I'm not the only one feeling bold today.\"\n\n You chuckle, raising a brow, and Jessica quickly snaps out of her momentary distraction. Her playful grin returns, but there's a subtle shift in the way she speaks—less teasing, more genuine. \"You know, you've got talent. Not just with the cheerleading but... with making an impression too.\"\n\n The words hang in the air between you, and neither of you speak.\n\n \"What does that mean, Jessica?\" Mia asks, smirking.\n\n \"Yeah, Jess, what does that mean?\" Tori repeats.\n\n Jessica adjusts her ponytail, fiddling nervously, and for the first time, you catch a flicker of something unfamiliar—a nervousness she tries to hide. \"All I'm saying is I didn't expect [name] to join us like this. [name]'s just different. In a good way.\"\n\n You feel your heart flutter slightly at the unintended compliment, and Jessica seems to realize it too. She shakes her head, a little frustrated with herself. \"Sorry, I didn't mean it in that way,\" she says, taking a deep breath to calm herself. \"I just mean you have potential, [name]. More than just someone who shows up and blends in.\"\n\n Before the squad can speak, Jessica raises a hand, cutting them off with a sharp glare. \"Not now, guys,\" she says, her tone making a clear indication to drop it. \"I'm just saying... he's gonna fit right in.\"\n \n \n As the squad bursts into laughter at your bold statement, Jessica's eyes briefly widen in surprise, though she quickly recovers. The laughter dies down, and Jessica's gaze shifts toward you with a playful smirk. Her eyes narrow slightly, as if sizing you up—part curious, part amused. \"Really, [name]?\" she teases, crossing her arms lightly over her chest. \"Me?\"\n\n Mia lets out a soft giggle, leaning toward Jessica with a raised brow. \"Oh my God, [name]. You've got guts.\"\n\n Jessica laughs softly, shaking her head. \"Alright, alright, I'll bite,\" she says, her eyes glimmering with amusement. She straightens up a bit, letting her tone take on a lighter edge. \"Jessica, huh? Why would you choose me though?\"\n\n The squad exchanges amused glances, clearly enjoying the playful jab.\n\n \"Well, [name]'s got good taste,\" Ashley says. \"You are pretty popular.\"\n\n Jessica waves her hand dismissively, the playful smile never leaving her lips. \"Popular, sure. But I'm the team captain. I've got enough on my plate without having to deal with that kind of attention.\"\n\n You catch a subtle flicker in her eyes that doesn't quite add up with her otherwise carefree demeanor. For a second, she seems almost thoughtful, but then she shakes it off.\n\n \"Thanks for the laugh though. You've got a good sense of humor.\"\n \n\n \n You shake your head with a soft laugh. \"I think I'll sit this one out.\"\n\n Mia pouts dramatically, leaning across the bench with exaggerated disappointment. \"Oh come on, [name]! Don't leave us hanging. Everyone's gotta have someone they've got their eye on.\"\n\n Ashley chimes in, wagging her finger playfully. \"Yeah, no fair keeping your crushes to yourself. We're a squad now, spill!\"\n\n Jessica glances at you and rolls her eyes at the others, though her smile is soft. \"Leave him alone, guys. Not everyone wants to air their personal business during a gossip session.\"\n\n \"Ugh, fine,\" Mia says, throwing up her hands. \"But you're seriously missing out. This is quality bonding time right here.\"\n\n Ashley laughs and nudges Mia. \"Let the guy off the hook, drama queen. Not everyone's as obsessed with matchmaking as you.\"\n\n The conversation shifts smoothly back to the other girls as they resume, dissecting the latest crushes and hallway rumors with a contagious energy.\n\n Jessica leans back in her seat, her gaze lingering on you for just a moment. There's something comforting about the fact that she stepped in to take the heat off you, a subtle but supportive gesture.\n\n You sit back, letting the chatter wash over you. There's something nice about being part of this group, even if you're not diving headfirst into their antics. For a moment, you just enjoy the warm camaraderie, glad they're including you even when you choose to stay on the sidelines.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

The air buzzes with anticipation, the energy of game day already coursing through everyone. Jessica takes her spot at the front of the group, clapping her hands to gather everyone's attention.\n\n\"Alright, squad!\" she begins. \"We've got some time before the game, so let's make it count. We'll start with a quick run-through of the cheers and then work on formations for the stunts. And remember, tonight we're performing under the lights, so keep that energy high!\"\n\nYou follow the group as they form two lines, joining in the synchronized warmup routine. The stretches and light cardio feel familiar after the last practice, but the added excitement of the game adds a little bounce to your step. Mia pairs up with you for partner stretches, chatting as you both reach for your toes.\n\n\"You're a natural, [name],\" she says with a grin. \"Honestly, it's like you've been cheering for years.\"\n\n\"Just trying to keep up with you,\" you joke, feeling a mix of pride and slight embarrassment at the compliment.\n\nOnce everyone is warmed up, Jessica leads the squad through a series of cheers. The cadence of the chants fill the gym, and you quickly fall into a rhythm, your movements sharp and confident. With every shout, stomp, and compliment, your confidence only grows.\n\nNext come the stunts. Jessica divides everyone into groups, pairing you with Mia, Ashley, and Tori for a simple pyramid. You plant your feet firmly, locking your arms as Mia steps into your grip to be lifted into position. Even as a base, it's exhilarating to feel the coordination and trust among your group, with every movement syncing perfectly.\n\n\"Great job, [name]!\" Jessica calls out as she circles the mats, keeping a watchful eye on everyone. \"That's solid!\"\n\nThe last practice drill is a short routine combining jumps, spins, and a final pose. Jessica counts off the steps, and you move in sync with the rest of the squad. When the routine ends with a sharp clap and a posed formation, everyone bursts into cheers.\n\n\"That was awesome!\" Mia says, giving you a high-five.\n\n\"You're ready for tonight,\" Jessica says with a smile. \"We all are. Let's bring that energy to the field.\"\n\nThe sound of sneakers squeaking on the polished gym floor is suddenly joined by the brisk, purposeful steps of Coach Moore. A tall woman with an athletic build and a commanding presence, she strides toward the group, her clipboard tucked under one arm. Her short hair and sharp gaze give her an air of authority. \n\n\"Alright, team,\" she calls out, clapping her hands together to gather the squad's attention. \"Tonight's the big game, and I want to see you all bringing your A-game out there.\"\n\n\"Oh, Coach, you're here early!\" Jessica says, panic starting to build in her voice as she looks at you. \n\nAs Coach Moore's eyes scan the group, they land on you. Her brows knit slightly in confusion, her eyes narrowing. She takes a few steps closer, pointing the pen in your direction.\n\n\"And who's this?\" she asks, glancing at Jessica. \"How'd you manage to recruit another cheerleader last minute?\"\n\nJessica freezes for a moment, somehow caught off guard. She opens her mouth, but no words come out as she looks at you, faltering under pressure.\n\nCoach Moore raises an eyebrow, her gaze shifting back to you. \"Well? I don't believe we've met. What's your name?\"\n\nThe squad is silent, their eyes flicking between you and Jessica, waiting to see how this would play out.\n\n[Choice: Tell Coach Moore the truth]\n[Choice: Pretend to be a girl]\n[Choice: Stay silent and let Jessica handle it]",

Jessica's nervous glance sharpens into something unreadable, but you catch a flicker of gratitude in her expression.\n\n \"My name's [name],\" you say, your voice steady but quiet. \"But, uh, I'm not actually a girl.\"\n\n Coach Moore's eyebrows shoot up, and the gym seems to grow quieter, though it's probably just in your head. She glances at Jessica and then back at you, her clipboard lowering to her side.\n\n \"You're not a girl?\" she repeats, her tone neither judgmental nor overly surprised.\n \n You shake your head, standing a little straighter. \"No, I'm just helping out with the squad because they're short on people,\" you begin. You pause, swallowing nervously. \"I went to practice yesterday, and they thought I could fill in. I know it's not, uh, typical, but I'm willing to work hard for the team tonight.\"\n\n Jessica takes a step forward, her hands clasped in front of her like she's about to plead her case. \"Coach, I know it's technically not allowed, but it's only for tonight,\" she interjects, her tone unusually earnest. \"We're down a cheerleader, and [name] stepped up. He's good—really good.\"\n\n Coach Moore looks you up and down, her eyes narrowing slightly as if trying to figure out how you fit into this picture. She taps her pen against her clipboard a few times, then lets out a sigh.\n\n \"I'll admit, this is unconventional,\" she says slowly, her voice measured. \"But I'll be honest with you—this team doesn't have room for mistakes right now. If Jessica says you're good, then I'll take her word for it. I expect you to perform like any other member of this squad though. No holding back.\"\n\n \"Understood,\" you reply, nodding.\n\n \"Oh, and [name], you've got big shoes to fill tonight,\" she adds, a small but knowing smile forming on her lips. \"But from what I know about this squad, they wouldn't have you here if they didn't think you could handle it.\"\n\n Jesica exhales audibly, a grin breaking across her face as she pats your shoulder. The tension in the room eases as the squad exchanges a few encouraging murmurs.\n\n \n \n \n \n The tension in the air is palpable as Coach Moore's expectant gaze lingers on you. For a split second, you consider coming clean, but something about Jessica's worried expression makes you hesitate. The weight of the coach's question hangs in the air, and you realize Jessica is waiting for you to respond, her subtle nod urging you to say something. Anything.\n\n A name. You need a name. Something feminine, something believable. Names flicker through your mind in rapid succession. Emily? No, too common. Sophia? Maybe, but it doesn't feel quite right. Lily? That's your sister's name, dumbass. Charlotte? Grace? Olivia? The pressure builds as the seconds stretch on, Jessica's faintly panicked expression urging you to decide quickly.\n\n Finally, a name surfaces, like a lifeline thrown into the chaos. You hesitate only for a second before opening your mouth.\n\n \"Hi coach, I'm .\" \n\n \n \n This will not be your permanent feminine name! There will be another textbox in the future regarding what feminine name you want to keep for the rest of the playthrough.\n \n\n \n \n You glance at Jessica, unsure of what to say, and decide to stay quiet. Jessica catches your look and straightens up, putting on her best confident smile—the one she always uses when she's in charge.\n\n \"Coach, this is... Ellie,\" Jessica says, the name tumbling out of her mouth with only the slightest hesitation. \"She's, uh, a friend of mine. I know we're short on a cheerleader because of Mandy going to Iowa, so I thought I'd bring her along. Ellie's really talented and has been dying to give cheer a try.\"\n\n Coach Moore raises an eyebrow, skepticism flickering in her sharp eyes. \"Ellie, huh? And you've been practicing with the squad?\"\n\n Jessica nods vigorously, stepping slightly in front of you. \"Absolutely! She's been helping out a lot, especially with some of the tougher routines. You know how hard it's been to get everyone synced up—Ellie's a natural!\"\n\n The coach tilts her head, studying you for a moment longer. Your heart pounds in your chest, but you manage to keep a poker face, trying to look as composed as possible. Finally, Coach Moore lets out a short breath and nods.\n\n \"Well, if she's as good as you say, I guess we'll see it tonight,\" she says, jotting something down on her clipboard.\n\n \"That was close,\" Jessica whispers to you. \"Sorry about the name—Ellie was the first thing that popped into my head.

Her eyes widen, her lips part slightly, and she seems completely caught off guard.\n\n \"Jessica?\" she blurts out, barely containing her incredulous laugh.\n\n \n Coach Moore tilts her head, a slight smile spreading across her face. \"Well, it's nice to meet you, [cheerleadername]. You must've really impressed Jessica to get invited here last minute.\" Her tone is welcoming but slightly amused. Almost as if this sort of thing happens more often than one might expect.\n\n Jessica laughs nervously, her hand lightly gripping your arm. \"Oh, totally. She's, uh, been interested in cheer for a while. With Mandy heading off to Iowa, I thought, why not give her a shot? You know, to see how she fits in.\"\n\n Coach Moore raises an eyebrow, clearly intrigued but not pressing the issue. \"Alright, fair enough. But next time, Jess, let me know if you're bringing in a recruit. I need to have my rosters finalized before game day.\"\n\n \"Yes, of course, Coach,\" Jessica nods eagerly. \"Won't happen again.\"\n\n As Coach Moore's attention shifts to the other cheerleaders setting up for practice, you let out a breath you didn't realize you were holding. Jessica leans in, her voice low and hurried. \"Nice save. That could've gone way worse.\"\n\n You nod, still feeling the adrenaline coursing through you. \"Yeah, thanks for backing me up.\"\n\n Jessica smirks. \"No problem, [cheerleadername]. I think it suits you, by the way.\"\n \n \nThe tension from the interaction with Coach Moore lingers briefly, but the team quickly refocuses on their warmups, each cheerleader throwing themselves into the final drills with practiced precision. The energy in the gym crackles with anticipation, a shared buzz of excitement for the first game of the season.\n\nAs the clock ticks down to game time, the squad huddles together near the entrance to the football field. The muffled roar of the growing crowd outside drifts through the walls. Jessica steps forward, holding her hands up to gather everyone's attention.\n\n\"Alright, listen up!\" she calls out, her voice carrying over the low murmur of the team. Everyone falls silent, turning their focus to her. Jessica looks around, her gaze holding steady. \"Tonight's our first game, and I know for some of you, it's your first time performing in front of a crowd this big. Trust me, I get it—it's nerve-wracking as all hell. But let me tell you something: you've got this. We've got this.\"\n\nShe gestures toward the field, her face lighting up in determination. \"The crowd is here to see the game, but you know what they'll remember? Us. Our energy. Our routines. Our smiles. So, let's give them a reason to cheer louder than ever. Let's show them what we've each been working so hard for.\"\n\nJessica pauses, her expression softening as she looks at each member of the squad. When her gaze lands on you, it lingers just a moment longer, a flicker of encouragement passing between you. \"No matter what happens out there, remember this: we're a team. We've got each other's backs. So, let's go out there and have fun, alright?\"\n\nThe squad erupts into cheers, their collective energy filling the room.\n\nJessica steps back, giving you a quick smile before turning to lead the squad toward the field. As the team lines up to head out, you take a deep breath, the adrenaline building in your chest. The muffled roar of the crowd grows louder as the door to the field swings open, and the night air rushes in. \n\n[Choice: It's time to perform]",

The stands are already packed with students and parents, their excited chatter merging into a low hum that reverberates through the air. The energy is so thick you can feel it. You breathe in the faint scent of popcorn and fresh-cut grass, trying to calm your nerves.\n\nYou stand among the other cheerleaders, feeling the warmth of their bodies close to yours, the rhythmic shifting of their movements syncing into a single pulse. The crowd grows even louder, cheering for their teams, and the sound sends a thrill racing through you. It's strange but exhilarating, and you feel you've never quite experienced this before.\n\nJessica steps to the front after you all get into position, her voice ringing out clearly. \"Alright, team!\" she yells. \"Let's show them what we've got!\"\n\nThe cheerleaders fall into formation as you all move with precision and fluidity. The choreography is sharp, practiced, yet filled with energy—each movement timed perfectly, each step flowing into the next with seamless grace.\n\nYou follow their lead, your heart pounding in your chest as nerves tangle in your stomach. You try to settle into the rhythm, but every movement feels unfamiliar and awkward at first. Your body hesitates and you can't help but feel exposed under the lights. The music blares in your ears, and your fingers tremble slightly as you keep in sync with the rest of the squad. It's a challenge to let your movements feel natural when your pulse is racing. The sensation of being dressed the way you are not making it any easier to focus. You fight to keep your footing, hoping you don't make a mistake.\n\nThe crowd's eyes begin to turn toward you. They cheer louder, drawn in by your motions, the vibrant color of the uniforms, and the sheer energy radiating from the squad.\n\nAs you follow the other cheerleaders through the routine, you feel the adrenaline continue to build. There's a thrill to this, a certain rush you didn't expect. Your nervousness melts away as the energy of the crowd, the spotlight, and the sound of your teammates take up your mind. It's exhilarating. Empowering.\n\nSuddenly, you realize you've fallen into the rhythm so naturally, almost instinctively. Each jump, each spin, flows together as if it's second nature. You're no longer just a part of the team on paper—you're performing now. You're giving everything you have, feeling the crowd's energy feed into your own.\n\nThe routine ends with one final pose, and the crowd erupts into cheers, the sound washing over the field like waves of excitement. You take a deep breath, standing tall with your teammates, basking in the collective triumph.\n\nFor now, all that matters is this moment. This team. This feeling.\n\n[Choice: Rest]",

The stadium is filled with a sea of cheering fans, all gathered to watch the first game of the season. The air buzzes with excitement, a mix of the bright lights above, the sound of the marching band playing, and the rhythmic stomp of feet from the football players.\n\nAs you take your place, you overhear a small group of boys nearby, huddled together with their eyes occasionally flicking in your direction. One of them leans closer to the other, his voice low but clear.\n\n \n \"Hey, did you see that new cheerleader? The Asian one with the black hair? Looks kinda cool.\"\n\n Another boy snickers. \"I mean, she's okay, but nothing special.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I guess,\" the first boy says. \"I think she's alright.\"\n\n You overhear their conversation and feel a subtle pang of discomfort—unseen, but felt, a reminder of how you still seem to blur between two worlds.\n\n \n \"That new cheerleader... kind of cute, right?\"\n\n Another laughs softly, shaking his head. \"Nah, looks alright, I guess. She's kinda pretty.\"\n\n \n \"Damn, who's that? She's super pretty.\"\n\n Another one snickers, clearly impressed. \"Yeah, wow. She's flawless, definitely rocking it.\"\n\n The words linger in your mind, impossible to ignore.\n \n\nThe players take their positions, lining up as the referee blows the whistle, signaling the start of the game. The crowd roars, a wave of energy that rolls across the field, bouncing from person to person.\n\nYour heart pounds in sync with the chants rising from the stands. The cheerleaders have fanned out around you, each of them settling into their spots. \n\nThe game begins, the ball snapped and hurled down the field as players charge forward. The tension of the field is palpable, the players clashing with intensity, muscles flexing. The crowd erupts into cheers with every pass, tackle, and touchdown. \n\nYou watch, cheering alongside the squad, feeling the energy build with each movement, each action on the field. The game moves fast and the players push themselves harder, sweat glistening on their brows under the floodlights, determined to secure every inch of ground.\n\nThe score is 14 - 21, with the Pacific Crest Panthers being down by 7 as the halftime buzzer blares through the field. The cheerleaders spring into action, ready to reinvigorate not only the fans but the team as well. The stands buzz with a mix of excitement and anticipation as fans sip drinks, eat snacks, chat, and wave school colors.\n\nYou position yourself at the edge of the group, blending into the rhythm as the routine begins. You start with a series of powerful jumps and your body moves through them effortlessly. The squad's chants rise in tempo, building with each beat, and the energy from the crowd feeds into your own.\n\nYou follow the lead of Jessica, her voice ringing clear as she guides the squad through each set. The group moves through flowing moves, stunts, and a pyramid. As the routine comes to a close, the crowd erupts into cheers, the sound echoing through the stadium. The Panthers are trailing, sure, but you all managed to fire the squad up again.\n\nAs the final notes of the band fade away, the cheerleaders break apart, each member dispersing, heading back to the sidelines. You feel a sense of accomplishment—knowing you've played a part in rallying the school spirit. The halftime routine truly cemented your place as a part of the team.\n\n[Choice: Watch the rest of the game]",

You spot Luke first, still in his casual clothes. Samantha is next to him, and she slides up beside you with her usual smirk the second she spots you. She's got a cold soda in one hand, her backpack slung lazily over one shoulder. \n\n\"There he is,\" Samantha says, nudging you lightly. \"Are you ready for the most thrilling night of your life? We're going to be watching sweaty dudes chase a ball for two hours. Truly, this is the peak of human ingenuity.\"\n\n\"You say that, but you'll be screaming your head off when we score,\" Luke says, rolling his eyes.\n\n\"I only scream ironically,\" Samantha says, sipping her drink. \"It's to make fun of the people who are screaming unironically.\"\n\n\"You literally lost your voice after last year's playoffs.\"\n\n\"That was different.\"\n\nLuke just shakes his head, knowing there's nothing he can say to change Samantha's mind. \"Anyway, I can't stay long—I've got warm-ups soon. I just wanted to see if you guys were coming.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't miss it for the world,\" you say, and it's true. Even if you're not on the field, the first game of the season is always something special.\n\n\"You nervous, Puke?\" Samantha asks, tilting her head.\n\nLuke shrugs, but there's an edge of honesty in his voice. \"To be completely honest? I am a little nervous, yeah. First game always feels weird. But we've got a solid team this year. Just gotta focus.\"\n\n\"Right, focus,\" Samantha says. \"Hey, if all else fails, you could always plow through people like a human wrecking ball.\"\n\n\"That's the plan,\" Luke laughs. \"Alright, I gotta head to the locker room. Catch you guys after?\"\n\nSamantha gives him a lazy salute. \"Go forth and conquer.\"\n\nLuke grins before jogging off, disappearing into the throng of students heading toward the football field.\n\nSamantha watches him go before turning to you. \"Well, there goes our local football hero,\" she says. \"Think we should be good friends and support him, or should we just show up at the end and pretend we were watching the whole time?\"\n\n\"Look, all I'm saying is if we're gonna sit through the entire game, we might as well get some snacks.\"\n\nSamantha's face lights up. \"Finally, a good idea. Let's go before the concession stand gets raided.\"\n\nThe two of you head toward the stadium and you notice that the sun is dipping lower in the sky. Everything is cast in a warm golden light, and the air is thick with the unmistakable buzz of game night energy.\n\nThe concession stand is already drawing a line, the smell of buttery popcorn and sizzling nachos wafting through the cool air. A few cheerleaders are nearby, chatting as they wait for their orders, while a couple of band kids argue over who has to carry the extra water bottles. The atmosphere is chaotic but familiar—encapsulating what Friday night football is all about.\n\n\"Alright, what's the move here?\" Samantha asks, scanning the menu. \"Are we going full junk food mode, or are you going to disappoint me and get something boring like, I don't know, a granola bar?\"\n\nYou can't help but roll your eyes. \"Do they even sell granola bars?\"\n\n\"If they did, I'd riot,\" she mutters. \"Anyway, I'm thinking popcorn and—oh, hell yeah, they have those giant pretzels. I'm getting one.\"\n\nYou glance over the options, debating as the line shuffles forward.\n\n\"C'mon, [name], this an absolutely critical decision,\" Samantha says dramatically. \"Your choice of stadium snack says everything about you as a person.\"\n\n\"Pretty sure it just says what I'm craving.\"\n\n\"Same thing.\"\n\nYou shake your head, but before you can say anything else, it's your turn to order.\n\n[Choice: Popcorn]\n[Choice: A hot dog]\n[Choice: Nachos]\n[Choice: A churro]",

You take a bite and it's warm, salty, and crunchy. Perfect.\n\n \"Okay, real talk,\" Samantha says. \"Did you ever wonder how they get popcorn to taste so much better in movie theaters and stadiums than at home?\"\n\n \"They probably just put a ton of butter,\" you say.\n\n \"Yeah, but scientifically and culinarily, I think there's more to it. Like I've made popcorn at home, and it never hits quite the same way. i think there's some kind of secret ingredient they're not telling us about.\"\n\n You snort. \"You think there's a conspiracy behind popcorn?\"\n\n \"Listen,\" she says, lowering her voice dramatically. \"I'm just saying that I wouldn't put it past Big Popcorn to be hiding the truth from us.\"\n\n \n You glance at the menu and make your decision. \"A hot dog for me, please.\"\n\n Samantha lets out a gasp, clutching her chest like you just insulted her. \"[name]. A glizzy? Out of all the things on the menu?\"\n\n You shrug, unbothered. \"It's a classic, what do you mean?\"\n\n She shakes her head. \"I don't know, man.

How is that any less basic?\"\n\n \"Hey, a stadium pretzel is an experience,\" she argues. \"It's warm, salty, and comes with cheese sauce too. Meanwhile, your hot dog is, like, one step above gas station food. Do you even know what part of a pig it comes from? No, you don't. Because the sausage is a meat obelisk from like a hundred pigs.\"\n\n \n You glance over the menu one last time before making your decision. \"I'll go with the nachos.\"\n\n Samantha grins like you've just earned her respect. \"Excellent choice, young grasshopper. Messy, cheesy, and completely impractical for a football game. I approve.\"\n\n The girl at the stand nods and turns to scoop up a generous amount of tortilla chips into a red-and-white paper tray before drowning them in cheese. You're about to tell her that's enough, but she adds an extra ladle just for good measure. Then, with an unnecessary flourish, she sprinkles on some jalapeños.\n\n Samantha snickers at your face. \"Hope you're ready for the experience of a lifetime, because those jalapeños don't mess around.\"\n\n \"We'll see,\" you say, grabbing a couple of napkins. \n\n With your nachos secured, Samantha picks up her order You pick up a chip and take a bite and it's an... experience. The jalapeño is spicy as all hell, and you find yourself coughing.\n\n Samantha lets out a loud laugh. \"Oh no, I told you they were spicy.\"\n\n You swallow and clear your throat, determined not to give her the satisfaction of seeing you suffer. \"I'm fine,\" you say, voice only slightly strained.\n\n \"Uh-huh,\" Samantha says, clearly enjoying this way too much. \"I won't make fun of you if you start crying. I swear. You can let those tears out.\"\n\n \n You glance over the options before your eyes land on something that immediately calls to you—the warm, cinnamon-dusted perfection of a churro.\n\n \"I'll take a churro,\" you say to the girl working at the stand.\n\n Samantha turns to you slowly. \"A churro?\" she repeats, approval clear in her voice. \"[name]. [name]. I didn't think I could respect you more, but here we are.\"\n\n You roll your eyes as the girl hands you the churro, still warm from the fryer. The sugary scent fills your nose, and when you take your first bite, the crispy outer layer gives way to the doughy center. The cinnamon and sugar coat your tongue, leading to an explosion in flavor.\n\n \"Yeah?\" Samantha asks as she watches your reaction.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you reply, swallowing.\n\n \"What a relief,\" she says. \"I would've disowned you as a friend if you went for something basic.\"\n\n \"You literally just got a pretzel,\" you observe.\n\n \"Excuse me, it's a giant pretzel,\" she corrects. \"It's about the vibe. And right now, let me tell you, your vibe is immaculate.\"\n \n\nThe two of you make your way out of the concession line and toward the bleachers. The crowd has grown even bigger in the short time you've been here and many students are filling the stands.\n\nSamantha nudges you, nodding toward a group of your peers waving someone over. \"Looks like the hype section's already filling up.

His usual easy smile is gone, replaced by something heavier.\n\n For a moment, neither of you say anything. The wind rustles through the trees, carrying the distant sound of cars on the main road and the occasional murmur of Samantha talking to herself on the other bench.\n\n Then, finally, Luke exhales and drops his head forward, resting his elbows on his knees. \"Fuck,\" he mutters. \"That sucked.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, nodding.\n\n He runs a hand through his hair, letting out a humorless chuckle. \"I thought we had it, you know? I really did. That last play—I saw the ball, I knew I could get it, and then... It was gone. Just like that.\"\n\n \"You were so close though, it was barely tipped.\"\n\n Luke huffs. \"Barely, yeah, but we still lost.\" He looks down, picking at the tape still wrapped around his fingers. \"I just wanted this win. For the team. For the school. For everyone who showed up to watch. I didn't want to let anyone down.\"\n\n There it is.\n\n You don't need to say anything to know how much that thought is eating at him. Luke's always been the kind of guy who carries everyone else—on the field, in the hallways, and in life. He makes people laugh when they need it. He hypes up his teammates, even when he's struggling himself. He's good. You know that. A genuinely good guy in a world that doesn't have enough of them.\n\n And right now, he feels like he failed.\n\n Another breeze drifts through the park. Luke leans back, looking up at the sky again, his expression unreadable. \"I know it's just one game,\" he says. \"And I know we've got the rest of the season ahead of us. But still. I just hate this feeling.\"\n\n His voice is quiet. Defeated in a way you don't usually hear from him.\n\n You could try to reassure him and tell him he didn't let anyone down. That no one blames him. Or maybe now isn't the time for words—maybe he just needs someone to sit here with him and remind him he's not alone.\n\n [Choice: Reassure him]\n [Choice: Stay silent]\n\n \n \n You walk over to Samantha's bench and drop down beside her. She doesn't look at you at first, but after a few seconds, she lets out a long sigh.\n\n \"[name], do you ever think about how weird benches are?\"\n\n You blink. \"Benches?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" she gestures vaguely. \"Like, they're just there. Everywhere. Parks, schools, outside of grocery stores. But no one really thinks about them. They're just there. They're just... benches.\"\n\n You snort. \"Is that really what you're thinking about right now?\"\n\n \"Why? Would you rather I give a soul-crushing monologue about the human condition and the fragility of existence?\"\n\n You chuckle and shake your head, then lean against the bench. A moment passes in silence, the two of you just existing in the same space. But eventually, you turn your head slightly. \"You know, I've known you for years, but sometimes I feel like I know almost nothing about you.\"\n\n Samantha doesn't move. Doesn't flinch. But something in the air shifts, just barely.\n\n \"Wow,\" she says, dragging out the word. \"That's not dramatic or anything.\"\n\n \"I mean it.\" You sit up a little, glancing at her. \"I know you're sarcastic. I know you like to mess with people. I know you drink too much soda and think that there's a big difference between doing things ironically and unironically. But I don't know anything real. Like where'd you grow up? Do you have any siblings? What's your favorite memory? Why do you never let anyone get too close?\"\n\n The last one slips out before you can stop yourself.\n\n Samantha is quiet for a little too long. Then, finally, she snorts and leans back again, throwing her arms over the back of the bench. \"Look, some people are open books. Others are mystery novels with missing pages.\"\n\n \"That's not an answer.\"\n\n She sighs, her gaze locked on the sky. \"[name], let me ask you something.\"\n\n \"...Okay?\"\n\n \"What if you did know everything? What if you knew every little thing about me—where I grew up, what makes me tick, all the messy stuff?\" She tilts her head slightly, but she doesn't look at you. \"What if you did, and you didn't like what you found?\"\n\n Something about the way she says it doesn't sit right with you.\n\n She's not dodging the question. It's more like she's already thought about the answer and decided it's better left unsaid.\n\n You open your mouth, about to say something, but she beats you to it. \"Anyway,\" she says, her usual teasing tone creeping back in. \"It's cute that you're curious, but I promise you, my backstory isn't that exciting. No secret twin, no long-lost fortune, no ancient prophecy.\" \n\n She flashes you a grin, but it's not as sharp as usual.\n\n [Choice: Push her to open up]\n [Choice: Let it go for now]",

His fingers pull at the tape around his knuckles absentmindedly. \"Tell that to the scoreboard.\"\n\n \"The scoreboard doesn't tell the whole story though,\" you counter. \"It doesn't show how many times you fought for extra yards.

No one thinks you failed them.\"\n\n He tilts his head, shooting you a skeptical look. \"You sure about that?\"\n\n \"I guarantee it,\" you say firmly. \"Do you really think anyone in that crowd is walking home going, 'Wow, I can't believe Luke lost us that game'?\"\n\n Luke lets out a quiet laugh and shakes his head.\n\n \"Exactly,\" you say. \"Because we all saw that you played your ass off and gave it everything. Sure, the catch didn't happen, but it was so close. That's just how football is sometimes, right?\"\n\n Luke rubs his hands over his face, letting out another breath. Some of the tension in his shoulders eases, even if its just a little. \"I just wanted to give everyone something to celebrate.\"\n\n \"Well, you did,\" you insist. \"People are still talking about the game.

His gaze lingers, searching, like he's seeing something he hadn't noticed before. The usual easy, joking Luke you've gotten so used to isn't here—there's something more raw in his eyes.\n\n \"You always this good at pep talks, [name]?\" he asks.\n\n You smirk. \"Only for those who deserve them.\"\n\n His smile lingers and he looks down for a second before looking back up at you. There's something in his eyes you swear wasn't there before.\n\n \"Sometimes, I don't know what I'd do without you,\" he admits quietly.\n\n It's a simple sentence, but it lands, and it lands hard. A slow warmth spreads through your chest, and for a moment, the night doesn't feel so cold.\n\n Your shoulders brush against each other, barely noticeable, but neither of you pulls away.\n\n Luke swallows, hesitating for a second longer, then looks at the stars once again. he doesn't say anything else, but he doesn't have to. The air between you is different now—something unspoken settling there, something neither of you are quite ready to name.\n\n But it's there.\n\n And that's enough.\n \n \n Luke doesn't answer right away, but you can tell he's letting your words sink in. He stares out at the empty playground for a few seconds before exhaling.\n\n \"You always this good at pep talks, [name]?\" he asks.\n\n You smirk. \"Only for those who deserve them.\"\n\n Luke snorts. \"Hey, I guess I'll take it.\"\n\n You nudge him lightly with your elbow. \"Good. Now stop beating yourself up over this and enjoy the night. We don't get many like this.\"\n\n He looks at you. Really looks at you. And after a moment, he nods. \"Yeah,\" he murmurs. \"You're right.\"\n\n The loss still stings, and it will sting for a while. You can see it in the way his jaw tightens. But the sadness isn't as heavy anymore. He'll be okay. Maybe not tonight, maybe not tomorrow, but soon.\n\n And that's enough.\n \n \n \n You don't say anything.\n\n You think about saying something, but something about the way he's sitting, shoulders slumped and hands loosely clasped between his knees, tells you that words won't really help right now.\n\n So instead, you just stay.\n\n Luke doesn't look at you, but he doesn't move away either. He just keeps staring at the sky, his chest rising and falling in slow, measured breaths. The weight of the game is still there, hanging like a dark cloud in the air between you. But somehow, it doesn't feel as bad as it did a minute ago.\n\n Luke exhales, running a hand over his face before letting it drop to his lap. His fingers drum idly against his knee like he's working through thoughts he can't quite put into words. But he doesn't look nearly as tense anymore.\n\n Finally, after what feels like a lifetime, he speaks.\n\n \"Thanks for sitting with me.\"\n\n It's simple, but there's something raw in his voice that tells you he needed this. Not a pep talk or forced positivity. Just someone beside him that understands.\n\n You nod, letting your own shoulders relax. \"Anytime.\"\n\n Neither of you move for a while. You just sit there, letting the night pass, letting the loss settle, letting it become something that won't sting so badly in the morning. And the feeling Luke has, the feeling that he let everyone down, won't go away immediately—but at least he doesn't have to carry it alone.\n \n\n \n \n \n You don't let her brush it off. Not this time.\n\n Instead of laughing or rolling with her deflection like you usually would, you sit up and lean forward. \"Samantha.\"\n\n She hesitates for half a second before sighing dramatically. \"What are you going to say, [name]?\"\n\n \"I mean what I said. I want to know you—the real you. Not just the sarcasm and deflections. You don't have to tell me everything, but I need you to know that... whatever it is, I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\n She exhales through her nose, staring at the ground. She's quiet for a long moment, maybe the longest she's ever been quiet around you. Her foot taps against the wood chips and her fingers drum against the back of the bench. They're tiny, restless movements like she's trying to shake something off.\n\n \"It's not that simple,\" she mutters, barely above a whisper.\n\n \"Why not?\"\n\n Samantha bites the inside of her cheek like she's debating something internally. For a second, you think she might say something real, something honest.\n\n \"Because, [name],\" she says, forcing a smirk. \"I'm an enigma. A mystery. A beautiful, unknowable force of nature. If I just start revealing things, what am I even bringing to the friendship?\"\n\n You don't laugh. \"Samantha.\"\n\n She shifts uncomfortably. \"Look, what if you knew me, and I wasn't what you thought?\"\n\n \"That's not going to happen.\"\n\n \"You say that now—\"\n\n \"No, I mean it,\" you say, turning toward her fully now. Finally, finally, she meets your eyes. \"You're my best friend, Samantha. You always have been. And nothing's gonna change that. I promise.\"\n\n Her expression falters as she searches your face, looking for some kind of lie or catch. But you just hold her gaze, steady and sure.\n\n Samantha swallows, letting out a tired laugh. \"Damn it, [name],\" she says. \"I hate it when you do that.\"\n\n \"Do what?\" you ask, blinking.\n\n \"That thing where you say something and you actually mean it.'\n\n Your lips twitch. \"It's called being honest. I'm a genuine person.\"\n\n \"Well, it's annoying.\" She throws her hands up in surrender before speaking. \"Fine. You want something real? Something deep and personal?\"\n\n You nod.\n\n \"Okay, here it is,\" she says, leaning in slightly. \"I hate mint chocolate chip ice cream.\"\n\n \"What?\" you ask, your eyebrows knitting.\n\n \"It tastes like toothpaste!\" she shudders. \"Actual, literal toothpaste.\"\n\n You stare at her, unimpressed. \"Seriously?\"\n\n \"Hey, you said you wanted to know me,\" she says, an actual grin lighting up her face.\n\n You groan, rubbing your hands down your face. \"Ugh, I hate you.\"\n\n \"No, you don't.\"\n\n You know there's still so much underneath the surface, but you're glad she let you get closer tonight, even if it was just a little.\n \n \n You watch Samantha for a moment, and there's something about the way she keeps her gaze fixed upward, avoiding your eyes. The smirk is still there, the teasing tone still in her voice, but now that you've noticed that wall, you can't unsee it.\n\n She's daring you to push. Waiting for you to ask a question. Maybe even expecting you to.\n\n But you don't.\n\n You let out a small breath and lean back, looking up at the sky with her. \"Alright,\" you say, keeping your voice light. \"I'll drop it.\"\n\n Samantha blinks. \"Wow. That easy, huh?\"\n\n \"Yeah.\" You shrug. \"When you're ready, you'll tell me. Or you won't. Either way, I'm still here.\"\n\n She doesn't responded right away. She just tilts her head slightly, studying you out of the corner of her eye. Her smirk is gone now, but for once, she doesn't try to cover the silence with a quip. She just sits with you, and maybe that's enough.\n\n Samantha exhales, then swings her legs back and forth to shake off the stillness. \"Anyway,\" she says, voice back to normal. \"I think we can both agree that sitting on benches in empty parks at night makes us look like weirdos.\"\n\n \"A little bit, yeah,\" you chuckle.\n\n \"Should we start making profound statements about life?\" she asks. She clears her throat dramatically. \"Time is a river, [name]. Ever flowing. Ever changing.\"\n\n You shake your head and laugh. \"That was terrible.\"\n\n \"Well, then how about you take a shot at it?\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but play along. \"Even the smallest moments can be the ones we remember the most.\"\n\n \"Alright, that was pretty good. But also, nerd alert.\"\n\n You nudge her lightly with your elbow. \"You literally started it.\"\n\n \"And yet, I will suffer no consequences.\"\n\n She leans back, letting the conversation drift into something lighter and easier. You don't push or pry. But maybe she'll remember this and know that you're waiting for her whenever she's ready.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Finish up after a long day]",

      "text": "You scan the bleachers, searching for a good spot. The section is packed, especially toward the front, where the loudest fans have already claimed their territory. The whole place is buzzing—painted faces, homemade signs, and students hyping each other up like this is the Super Bowl.\n\n \"Okay, so slight problem,\" Samantha mutters beside you, shielding her eyes as she looks over the crowd. \"All the good seats are taken.\"\n\n You frown, searching for an opening. She's right—every front-row spot is crammed with students draped in Pacific Crest's school colors, already chanting.\n\n Except for one spot.\n\n Your eyes land on a nearly empty stretch of bench, right near the fifty-yard line. Prime viewing real estate. But there's a reason no one is sitting there.\n\n Aurora.\n\n She's perched near the edge of the section, her legs crossed, completely unbothered by the chaos around her. Dressed in her usual dark clothes, she looks like she wandered out of a different world and accidentally ended up at a high school football game. Her long, black-painted nails tap lazily against the aluminum bench as she watches the field with an unreadable expression.\n\n Nobody dares sit near her.\n\n There are rumors about Aurora. That she practices witchcraft. That she can see your future just by looking at you. That she once made a guy puke just by whispering something in his ear. Most people keep their distance, which is why the seats next to her are completely empty.\n\n Samantha follows your gaze and lets out a low whistle. \"Oof. Well. There's always standing room, right?\"\n\n You glance back at the packed stand, where the only other option is squeezing between a group of sweaty guys yelling about how many yards Jordan can throw. You look back at the perfectly open seats next to Aurora.\n\n \"...It's just a seat,\" you say, already making your way down the bleachers.\n\n Samantha sputters. \"Wait, you're actually—[name]!\" She groans but follows after you.\n\n You reach the empty bench and hesitate for a second before sitting down. Samantha plops down beside you, her posture stiff, like she's waiting for a ghost to appear.\n\n Aurora doesn't react at first. She simply blinks, slowly turning her head toward you. You meet her gaze, staring at her dark purple eyes.\n\n \"Brave,\" she murmurs, tilting her head slightly.\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"For sitting?\"\n\n A slow, knowing smile spreads across her face. \"For sitting here.\"\n\n Samantha clears her throat awkwardly. \"Um. We can move if—\"\n\n Aurora lifts a finger, silencing her with a small, amused shake of her head. \"There's no need, Samantha,\" she says. \"You've made your choice.\"\n\n There's something eerie about the way she says it, but before you can figure out what she means, Samantha leans in and whispers. \"Okay, if I get turned into a rat or something, I just want you to know this is your fault.\"\n\n You smirk but don't answer, eyes flicking toward Aurora again. There's something about her that makes you curious. Something you can't quite put your finger on.\n\n For some reason though, you get the feeling that she knew you'd sit here before you even did.\n\n [Choice: Make small talk with Aurora]\n [Choice: Just ignore Aurora]\n\n \n \n You scan the packed bleachers, trying to find an open spot. The front rows are a lost cause—completely filled with screaming fans. You nod toward the higher rows. \"Let's head to the back. There's more space up there.\"\n\n Samantha wrinkles her nose. \"Ugh, you mean the section where people pretend to watch the game while they're actually on their phones?\"\n\n \"Hey, it's either that or standing the entire time.\"\n\n She sighs but follows as you weave your way up the steps toward the top of the bleachers. The atmosphere shifts the higher you go—less frantic energy, more casual conversation. The students up here aren't decked out in the school colors or yelling. Instead, they're relaxing, chatting, or vaguely paying attention.\n\n And that's when you spot him.\n\n Vincent.\n\n He's sitting a few rows from the very top, his posture a little stiff, but he looks around with wide, eager eyes, taking in the entire field like he's observing an alien planet. His hoodie is slightly oversized, the sleeves bunched around his hands as he fidgets with the strap of his backpack. A small notebook is balanced on his knee and a pencil is tucked behind his ear.\n\n The moment he spots you, his face lights up. \"[name]!\" he waves enthusiastically, then gestures to the open seats beside him. \"Hey! Over here!\"\n\n Samantha raises an eyebrow. \"Vincent? Vincent is at a football game? What, did the chess club get lost on the way to a tournament?\"\n\n You shake your head, grinning, and make your way over. \"Hey, Vinny. Didn't expect to see you here.\"\n\n He beams, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. \"I know, right? This isn't my usual scene. But I figured, you know, new school year, new experiences. Maybe if I actually understood football, I could make more friends.\"\n\n Samantha plops down beside you, eyeing Vincent's notebook. \"Please don't tell me you're taking notes on the game.\"\n\n Vincent huffs. \"It helps me remember things! I was watching some highlight reels earlier, and I think I have the basics down now. But there are still some things I don't get. Like—why is it called a 'safety' if it gives the other team points? I don't know about you, but to me, that seems incredibly misleading.\"\n\n You can't help but laugh, finding his antics endearing. \"Yeah, football rules are kinda weird.\"\n\n \"Right? And don't even get me started on the terminology,\" Vincent continues. \"I was looking up plays earlier, and apparently, there's something called a 'hook and ladder'? That's not a play, that's a firefighting apparatus!\"\n\n Samantha snorts, taking a sip of her soda. \"You know what, I'm officially glad we sat here.\"\n\n Vincent grins. \"See? My plan is already working. I'm learning and I'm making friends!\"\n\n As the game gets ready to start, the three of you settle into your seats. Vincent flips open his notebook, pencil at the ready. \"Alright, [name], be my guide. Teach me the ways of football.\"\n\n Samantha leans back, an amused smirk on her face. \"Oh, this is gonna be good.\"\n\n [Choice: Give half-serious, half-joking answers]\n \n [Choice: Ask Samantha to explain the rules]\n \n \n [Choice: Patiently explain the rules]",

She's watching the field, but there's something off about the way she does it—like she's studying it instead of just watching. Her dark eyes flick across the field, taking in every detail, but there's no emotion on her face. No excitement. No tension. Just observation.\n\n You clear your throat. \"Didn't think you were the football type.\"\n\n Aurora doesn't turn her head, but her lips curl into the faintest smirk. \"I'm not.\"\n\n You wait a few beats for her to elaborate, but she doesn't.\n\n \"So, you just love sitting in cold metal bleachers for fun?\" you try again, hoping to get more than just a cryptic response.\n\n At that, she does turn to look at you. Her gaze is calm but heavy, like she's seeing past you, not just at you. \"There are worse places to be.\"\n\n You frown. \"That doesn't really answer my question, does it?\"\n\n Aurora tilts her head slightly, her smirk deepening. It's almost as if she's enjoying this. \"Maybe your question wasn't the right one.\"\n\n You blink. \"Okay, what would be the right question?\"\n\n She considers your words, tapping her black-painted nails against the bench. \"Maybe something like... 'Why am I really here?'\"\n\n You hesitate. Something about the way she says those words sends a chill down your spine. \"Alright. Why are you really here?\"\n\n Aurora exhales slowly, turning her gaze back to the field. \"Because this place is interesting.\"\n\n \"Interesting how?\"\n\n She doesn't answer right away. Then, she softly murmurs, \"Something isn't quite right at Pacific Crest.\"\n\n Your stomach tightens. \"What does that mean?\"\n\n She finally looks back at you again, but her gaze is much sharper. Then she smiles—not a warm smile, but something knowing, something almost amused.\n\n \"I think you already know, [name].\"\n\n The way she says your name sends a shiver down your spine. When you glance back at her though, Aurora is already watching the field again, like the conversation never happened.\n \n \n Samantha shifts beside you, arms crossed tightly over her chest. \"Okay,\" she mutters under her breath. \"I have one question.\"\n\n You glance at her. \"Yeah?\"\n\n She turns her head slowly, eyes narrowed. \"Why in the hell did we sit here?\"\n\n \"Because the rest of the front was full?\"\n\n Samantha gestures—not subtly—toward Aurora, who sits beside you. She's completely unbothered by the noise of the game, sitting as still as a statue. \"Yes, but we could've sat anywhere else. Anywhere would've been better than the one open spot next to the omen of doom over there.\"\n\n Aurora doesn't react. She just watches the game, fingers tapping idly against the metal bench.\n\n Samantha leans in. \"Seriously, [name],\" she whispers. \"Do you want to get hexed?\"\n\n You roll your eyes. \"She's not gonna hex us.\"\n\n \"Uh-huh,\" Samantha says. \"Tell that to Jeremy. He sat next to her last year, and you know what happened? He broke his legs two days later. Coincidence? I think not.\"\n\n \"Well, I think he just tripped over his own feet.\"\n\n Samantha scoffs. \"Maybe that's what she wants you to think.\"\n\n You sigh, turning back to the game, trying to ignore her dramatics. But out of the corner of your eye, you catch Aurora's lips curve into the faintest smirk.\n\n She definitely heard everything.\n\n And she's definitely enjoying it.\n \n\n \n \n \n You glance at Vincent, who's staring at the field with an intense focus, his pencil hovering over his notebook. You exchange a quick look with Samantha, and without a word, you both silently agree that this is too good of an opportunity to pass up.\n\n \"Alright, look here, Vincent,\" you say, keeping your tone serious. \"The first thing you need to know is that football is way more complicated than it seems. And it seems complicated enough. It's not just about scoring points—it's about outsmarting the enemy.\"\n\n Vincent nods eagerly, scribbling in his notebook. \"Right. Outsmarting. Got it.\"\n\n \"You already know about touchdowns, but what you don't know is that teams actually get bonus points for the best touchdown celebration.\"\n\n Vincent pauses. \"Wait, what?\"\n\n You nod solemnly. \"Yeah, that's why players do all those dance moves after they score. The flashier the celebration, the more points they get. But there are rules—if two players sync their dances, that's an automatic extra point. And if the whole team joins in? Hell, that's a secret double-touchdown bonus.\"\n \n Vincent's eyes widen as he furiously writes down the information you're feeding him. \"So—that means if someone scores, and then everyone starts dancing, they can, theoretically speaking, double their score.\"\n\n \"Exactly, you got it,\" you say, keeping a straight face. \"It's called the 'Rhythm Rule.'\"\n\n Samantha snorts into her drink but covers it up with a cough.\n\n \"That makes a lot of sense,\" Vincent mumbles, nodding as he jots it down. \"What else?\"\n\n You tap your chin, pretending to think deeply. \"Alright, here's an important one. You know how there's offense and defense? Well, there's actually a secret third unit.\"\n\n Vincent blinks. \"...Secret unit?\"\n\n You nod. \"Yeah. It's called the Stealth Team. They wear identical uniforms to blend in, but their actual job is to mess with the other team. They untie shoelaces, whisper fake play calls, and hide the football in their jerseys.\"\n\n \"Come on, that can't be real,\" Vincent says, skepticism lacing his voice.\n\n You sigh and shake your head. \"That's what they want you to think, Vinny. If they were obvious, it wouldn't be a stealth team, would it?\"\n\n Samantha is shaking with silent laughter.\n\n \"There's one last thing,\" you say, deciding to go all in. \"See that referee down there? He's not actually officiating. He's a decoy ref, planted by the NFL to secretly scout for high school players with elite potential. If a player impresses him, they automatically get a draft offer.\"\n\n Vincent gasps. \"WHAT?\"\n\n \"Yep, but they don't announce it right away. The chosen players just finds a golden ticket in their locker after the game. Kind of like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\"\n\n \"That's insane,\" Vincent stares at the field, looking genuinely stunned. \"I didn't know high school football was this deep.\"\n\n You and Samantha are barely holding it together, and Vincent's eyes dart from his notebook to the football players.\n\n \"Wait,\" he mutters, flipping through his notes. Panic starts creeping into his expression. \"They're not... they're not warming up with dances... And—where's the Stealth Team? Shouldn't they be blending in by now?\"\n\n Samantha can't hold it in anymore. She bursts out laughing, nearly dropping her soda.\n\n Vincent slowly turns to you, realization dawning. \"You lied to me.\"\n\n You crack a grin. \"I may have exaggerated just a little.\"\n\n Vincent's jaw drops. He looks down at his notebook, where he has Rhythm Rule, Stealth Team, and Golden Ticket Referee written in meticulous cursive. His shoulders slump and when he finally looks up at you, his expression isn't playful or annoyed. It's just... hurt.\n\n \"You lied to me,\" he repeats, quieter this time. His voice is just soft. Disappointed. \n\n The laughter that had been bubbling in your chest dies instantly. Samantha, who had been wiping away a tear of amusement, notices the shift too. She glances between you and Vincent, her smirk fading.\n\n Vincent looks down at his notebook. \"I really thought I was learning something,\" he murmurs. \"I thought... I don't know. Maybe if I actually understood the game, people wouldn't just see me as the nerd who's always out of place.\"\n\n A hollow feeling settles in your stomach.\n\n \"I thought if I tried hard enough, I could actually fit in for once,\" Vincent continues. \"I trusted you to help me, [name].\"\n \n You open your mouth, but no words come out. The worst part is that he's not yelling. He's not calling you out or making a big deal out of it. He just sounds exhausted. Like this isn't the first time someone's treated him like a joke.\n\n The background noise of the game, the cheering, the announcer's voice—it all fades for a second. All you can focus on is Vincent, sitting there with his notebook full of fake rules, realizing that he'd just been made a fool of.\n\n \"I guess I should've known,\" he says, voice barely above a whisper. \"It was kind of stupid to think I could be a part of this, wasn't it?\"\n\n He starts flipping to a blank page as if erasing everything will make it hurt less.\n\n And suddenly, you feel awful for making Vincent feel like an outsider all over again.\n \n \n \n You hesitate, realizing that you don't actually know much about football yourself. You kind of get the general idea—score points, run fast, don't get tackled—but the finer details elude you.\n\n Vincent watches you expectantly, his pencil poised over his notebook like he's ready to absorb your knowledge.\n\n \"So... uh...\" You rub the back of your neck, glancing at the field as if answers might magically appear. \"Basically, they try to get the ball to the other side, and, um... there's a lot of running?\"\n\n Vincent blinks. \"Okay. And...?\"\n\n Samantha snorts beside you. \"Oh my God, [name], that was pathetic.\"\n\n You sigh. \"Yeah, sorry, I got nothing.\"\n\n Samantha cracks her knuckles. \"Alright, step aside, amateur. I will be your football guru tonight.\"\n\n Vincent perks up immediately. \"Yes! Teach me, Sensei.\"\n\n Samantha launches into an explanation—far more detailed, animated, and occasionally laced with sarcasm. She gestures wildly as she talks, using her massive pretzel as a stand-in for the ball at one point, and even reenacts a quarterback pass (which nearly knocks over Vincent's notebook).\n\n Vincent hangs onto every word, occasionally gasping in awe. \"Wait, that's what a down is? That actually makes so much sense.\"\n\n \"It's all just controlled chaos,\" Samantha says, clearly pleased with herself.\n\n Vincent looks at her like she just told him the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. \"Samantha, you are a treasure to this world.\"\n\n She winks. \"I know.\"\n\n You shake your head, amused. You may not have been able to help, but watching Samantha dramatically educate Vincent on football was amazing to see.\n \n \n \n You take a deep breath and start explaining the basics of football to Vincent—positions, downs, scoring, all the stuff that makes the game make sense. He listens with all the intensity of someone studying for a final exam, nodding along, his pencil furiously scratching across his notebook.\n\n Every so often, he murmurs little responses like, \"Ohh, okay, so that's how they do that,\" or \"Wait, that actually makes so much sense now!\" His eyes light up with every new piece of information, and he looks genuinely thrilled to finally be understanding the sport.\n\n At one point, he pauses, staring down at his notes with a soft gasp. \"[name],\" he says, voice filled with wonder, \"I think... I think I get it.\"\n\n You chuckle. \"Yeah?\"\n\n He nods excitedly. \"It's like... a strategy game, but with a ball! And tackling!\" He looks at the field, his gaze full of new appreciation. \"This is so much cooler now that I understand what's happening.\"\n\n Samantha watches him, shaking her head with a smirk. \"I swear, you're like a little scientist who just discovered fire.\"\n\n Vincent is unable to hide his grin as he adjusts his glasses. \"Football is way more interesting than I thought it'd be. Thanks, [name]. You're, like, the best teacher ever.\"\n\n His enthusiasm is so genuine, so utterly Vincent, that you can't help but smile.\n \n \n \n\n[Choice: Watch the cheerleaders]",

The crowd hums with anticipation, students leaning forward in their seats, waiting for the pre-game show to begin.\n\n You watch from the bleachers and even from your seat, you can tell Jessica is all business. The rest of the squad mirrors her energy, feeding off her determination. You recognize parts of the routine, the same ones you had given advice on after school. You're not an expert, not even close, but you'd helped them adjust some transitions, given suggestions on where they could hit cleaner angles, and pointed out a few awkward moments that even you could tell weren't working.\n\n Now, as they move into their first sequence, you can see the effect of those adjustments. The timing is sharper and the formations are cleaner. When they hit their first major stunt, the crowd lets out a collective cheer. The flyer lands perfectly, the bases catching her with solid grips before she bounces back into formation.\n\n Jessica claps her hands together in rhythm, leading the team into the next section. The movements are crisp and the choreography flows well. You catch a few moments where the spacing is slightly off, but to most of the audience, it probably looks seamless.\n\n But you know Jessica. And you can tell by the way her jaw tightens for just a moment that she notices every tiny mistake.\n\n The cheerleaders transition into the final sequence, a mix of tumbling and jumps designed to get the crowd hyped. A few of them land their tumbling passes perfectly, but one girl stumbles slightly.\n\n Jessica doesn't falter—her smile stays fixed and her energy stays unwavering—but you see it. The way she pushes harder, the way her movements become even sharper. It's as if she's trying to will the team to perfection through the sheer force of her determination.\n\n They finish strong, hitting their final pose with precision as the crowd erupts in cheers. From the outside, it looks like a success. The students around you are clapping, but when you glance back at Jessica, you can see the frustration simmering beneath the surface.\n\n \n The stadium is buzzing with excitement as the pre-game show kicks off. The announcer's voice cackles over the speakers, hyping up the crowd as the cheer squad rushes onto the field, their pom-poms shaking in unison. But even from the stands, something feels... off.\n\n Jessica leads the squad, her usual confidence still there, but it's dimmer, strained. You can see it in the way she moves—her smile a little too tight, her motions just a little too rushed. It's as if she's desperately trying to keep everything together.\n\n The routine starts, and almost immediately, things go wrong.\n\n Their timing is off. The formations don't line up properly, with some girls stepping too soon and others scrambling to catch up. A few of the jumps look messy, landing with stumbles. It's not terrible, but it's far from the polished performance the crowd expected from Jessica.\n\n Then comes the stunts.\n\n Jessica positions herself at the front of a formation, setting up a pyramid. But as the flyers go up, one of them wobbles—a misstep in the base's grip. There's a sharp intake of breath from just about everyone, and while the girl doesn't fall completely, her landing is sloppy.\n\n Jessica's jaw tightens. She claps her hands, trying to rally the team back into rhythm, but you can tell she's struggling to hold it all together. She throws herself into the final moves, trying to make up for the earlier mistakes, but her usual spark just isn't quite there.\n\n By the time the routine ends, there's an awkward pause before the crowd starts clapping. It's polite, almost out of pity. Certainly not the roaring applause the cheerleaders are probably used to.\n\n Jessica turns back to her squad, clapping and offering forced smiles, but the effort is paper-thin. Up close, the stadium lights catch the tension in her face—the way her jaw tightens, the way her eyes dart from one teammate to the next, searching for reassurance and finding none.\n\n No one is meeting her gaze. The other girls look exhausted, disappointed, and frustrated. A few of them mutter to each other as they pick up their pom-poms, their expressions unreadable but unmistakeably distant. One girl sighs heavily, rubbing her forehead. Another shrugs, shaking her head before jogging off the field without a word.\n\n Jessica's hands tremble just slightly as she lowers them to her sides. Her breathing is shallow, and even from where you are, you can see the way her chest rises and falls too quickly—like someone barely holding it together.\n\n The polite applause from the crowd has already died down. People are talking, distracted, already moving on like the performance was nothing more than a forgettable pre-show warm-up.\n\n Her eyes flick toward where the students are sitting. Some people are whispering. A few look unimpressed. Some of the football players aren't even trying to be subtle. They're chuckling about something, and one of them even mimics a wobbly stunt with his hand before laughing.\n\n No one cares that she just poured everything she had into that routine, that she tried too fucking hard to make it work.\n\n Jessica swallows, blinking rapidly as she brushes a stray hair from her face. But the movement is too quick, too stiff—like she's trying to distract herself.\n\n She turns toward the sideline, biting her lip so hard it turns white. And then, just for a second—so quick you almost miss it— her expression cracks.\n\n Her shoulders hunch ever so slightly. Her fingers curl into the fabric of her skirt as she grips it tight. Her lower lip quivers before she presses her mouth into a thin line, forcing herself to swallow whatever's threatening to escape.\n\n Tears.\n\n She's this close to crying in front of the entire school.\n\n But she doesn't.\n\n Instead, she straightens, rolls her shoulders back, and wipes at her face under the guise of adjusting her ponytail. Then, she turns sharply and jogs off the field. Her movements are stiff, it's as if she knows that she might break down completely if she lets herself slow down.\n\n And just like that, she's gone, swallowed up by the crowd of cheerleaders moving toward the sidelines.\n \n\n[Choice: Watch the game]",

People are on their feet, screaming, waving signs, and throwing their hands up. The school band blasts a triumphant tune as the players explode into action.\n\n You're right in the middle of it, sitting in the front row. Right next to the Aurora Rowan.\n\n And she hasn't moved an inch.\n\n While the rest of the students are shouting and reacting, Aurora just watches, her gaze locked onto the field like she's studying something the rest of you can't see. Her posture is eerily still and you're not even sure if she's blinking.\n\n Samantha, on the other hand, is not relaxed.\n\n \"[name],\" she hisses. \"I don't like this.\"\n\n \"You don't like football?\" you ask, knowing that's not what she means.\n\n \"I don't like sitting next to her.\" She cuts her eyes toward Aurora, who doesn't acknowledge either of you. \"She's just... sitting there! Not cheering, not reacting, just staring.\"\n\n You shrug. \"Maybe she just likes watching the game, Samantha.\"\n\n Samantha scoffs. \"She's not watching the game. She's analyzing it like it's some kind of ancient prophecy.\"\n\n You glance at Aurora again. She's still perfectly composed, her eyes flicking over the field as she tracks every movement. She doesn't flinch when players slam into each other or react when the crowd explodes. It's like she already knows what's going to happen before it does.\n\n Samantha leans in close. \"You owe me for this,\" she mutters. \"Just so you know, if anything happens to me, I'm haunting your fucking house.\"\n\n Aurora finally moves. She tilts her head in Samantha's direction, lips curving into the faintest of smirks.\n\n She definitely heard that.\n\n Samantha immediately stiffens. \"Come on,\" she mutters.\n\n You fight back a choice, turning back to the game as the next play begins. You don't know how the night's going to go, but one thing is for sure—sitting here was not the boring choice.\n\n \n The game kicks off with a roar from the crowd, but up in the back rows of the bleachers, the energy is a little different. In stark contrast to the front-row students chanting and waving signs, the back section is more relaxed—people chatting, scrolling, or half-watching while munching on snacks.\n\n Vincent, however, is fully locked in.\n\n He leans forward in his seat, his eyes flicking between the field and his notebook, where he's already scribbling down observations. \"Okay, I think I understand formations,\" he mutters. \"I am so ready for this.\"\n\n You smirk. \"You say that like you're about to step onto the field.\"\n\n \"I am stepping onto the field—intellectually.\" He taps his temple. \"I have trained. I have studied. And now, I will witness the great and noble sport of football... in action.\"\n\n Samantha, sprawled out on the bleachers, snorts. \"You're such a dork, Vincent.\"\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n The game starts, and for a few minutes, Vincent is completely absorbed, eyes darting between players. He hums under his breath, nodding ot himself every so often.\n\n \"Oh my God,\" Vincent suddenly blurts out, sitting up straight. \"They're chasing him!\"\n\n You blink.\n\n \"Yeah, that's kind of the point of this sport.\"\n\n \"No, but look! The guy with the ball—he's fleeing for his life!\" Vincent grips your arm, eyes wide. \"It's like... the Battle of Agincourt! The English longbowmen break the French charge, and now he's the lone knight retreating, trying to reach his own lines before the enemy cuts him down!\"\n\n Samantha raise an eyebrow. \"Vincent. That's just a breakaway run.\"\n\n \"A breakaway run of destiny,\" he corrects.\n\n You shake your head. \"Vincent, I like this too, but you make this sound way more dramatic than it is.\"\n\n \"Because it is dramatic!\" he says, gesturing wildly to the field. \"These warriors are putting their bodies, and brains, on the line for honor, victory, and school spirit!\"\n\n Samantha leans toward you, whispering. \"He's seriously a few minutes away from starting a soliloquy.\"\n\n You snicker.\n\n The game continues, and Vincent's reactions only get better. He cheers at random moments, completely ignoring whether the rest of the crowd is reacting. At one point, when a player from the opposing team fumbles, Vincent gasps so loudly that people stare.\n\n \"This is great,\" he whispers. \"The unpredictability. The stakes. The raw, primal energy of the crowd—\"\n\n \"Dude,\" Samantha interrupts. \"You have no idea what's going on, do you?\"\n\n Vincent's expression goes blank for a second before he coughs awkwardly. \"Not a clue.\"\n\n You burst out laughing, and even Samantha grins.\n\n \"Okay, but I am getting some of it!\" Vincent insists, jabbing his pencil at his notebook. \"For example, I understand what a down is now. And the quarterback is basically the field general, don't you think? Strategizing, adjusting formations, reading the defense—kind of like Napoleon at Austerlitz, except with less cavalry.\"\n\n By halftime, he slams the notebook shut and lets out a satisfied sigh. \"Alright. I'm officially a football guy now.\"\n\n Samantha raises an eyebrow. \"You literally just said you had no idea what was happening.\"\n\n \"That doesn't matter.\" He waves a hand dismissively. \"It's about the spirit.\"\n\n You shake your head and laugh, but honestly? Sitting back here with Vincent and Samantha, the game playing out below—it's the most fun you've had at a football game in a long time.\n \n\n[Choice: The game winds down]",

You're all buzzing with anticipation, every single person either on their feet or gripping their seat like their life depends on it.\n\n Samantha is leaning forward, elbows on her knees. \"This is it,\" she mutters. \"The final play. Everything is on the line.\"\n\n In stark contrast to her, Aurora is completely still. Her hands are folded neatly in her lap and she's watching with her usual unreadable expression. She hasn't cheered once this entire game—not at a touchdown, not at a big hit, not at anything. It's like she's studying something deeper.\n\n Right now, though, you don't have time to dwell on it. The final play is happening.\n\n Luke, sprinting down the sideline, shakes his defender and gets open. The quarterback, Jordan, sees him. The ball is launched into the air, spiraling perfectly against the bright stadium lights. The entire crowd holds its breath.\n\n You hear Samantha whisper. \"Come on, come on, come on—\"\n\n The ball drops.\n\n Luke stretches out his hands—\n\n And a Riverview defender leaps, knocking it away at the last second.\n\n The collective gasp from the crowd is deafening.\n\n The clock hits zero.\n\n Game over.\n\n For a second, there's silence. Then, the Riverview players all erupt onto the field to celebrate. Pacific Crest's sideline stays still—some players have their hands on their helmets while some just stare at the scoreboard with a blank expression.\n\n Samantha lets out a strangled noise of frustration. \"Are you kidding me?!\" She slumps back against the bleachers, covering her face with both hands. \"Damn it, that was right there! I can't believe we lost like that.\"\n\n You exhale and run a hand through your hair. It hurts—being so close, only for it to slip away at the last second.\n\n Aurora, as par for the course, doesn't react like a normal person. She simply hums, tilting her head slightly.\n\n Samantha sits up sharply and points at her. \"Okay, don't you dare sit there and hum like you knew that was going to happen.\"\n\n Aurora's lips curve slightly. \"The outcome was inevitable.\"\n\n Samantha throws her hands in the air. \"Oh, that's comforting, thanks.\"\n\n Samantha groans and pulls you up by the arm. \"Come on. We should at least go find Luke and tell him he doesn't totally suck.\"\n\n You nod, but as you walk away, you steal one last glance at Aurora.\n\n She doesn't move.\n\n She just watches.\n\n \n The fourth quarter winds down, and the tension in the stadium has reached it's peak. The scoreboard flashes its cruel numbers under the stadium lights: Pacific Crest 27, Riverview 30—just three points down. There's barely any time left, but the Panthers have the ball, and the entire crowd is on edge.\n\n Vincent is gripping his notebook so tightly it's starting to crumple. \"This is it,\" he mutters. \"The final charge. The Battle of Hastings. The Alamo. The—\"\n\n \"Vincent,\" Samantha interrupts. \"Not now.\"\n\n The ball snaps. Jordan, the quarterback, drops back, scanning the field. Luke, sprinting down the sideline, burns past his defender. He's open.\n\n The ball launches into the air, spiraling against the night sky. The entire stadium seems to hold its breath.\n\n Vincent actually grabs your arm. \"If he catches this, we can win!\"\n\n The ball comes down, Luke stretches out his hands, but at the last second, a Riverview defender knocks it away.\n\n The collective gasp from the crowd is deafening.\n\n Vincent practically collapses, wailing and clutching his head like he just watched the Library of Alexandria burn down.\n\n Samantha curses under her breath. \"God damn it.\"\n\n The clock hits zero. It's over.\n\n Riverview players storm the field, celebrating their win. On the other side, the Pacific Crest team stands still, staring at the scoreboard like they can't believe it's real.\n\n Luke rips off his helmet, shaking his head. Even from the back, you can see how frustrated he is.\n\n Vincent lets out an exhausted sigh. 'That was tragic.\"\n\n Samantha groans and leans back against the bleachers. \"I seriously cannot believe we lost like that.\"\n\n \"Honestly, I think that was worse than if we had just gotten crushed,\" Vincent says, still in shock.\n\n You nod slowly. Losing this close—right at the finish lines—somehow stings far more than if it had never been in reach at all.\n\n The stadium noise starts to fade as the students begin shuffling out, their excitement drained. Some people stay back to talk, but most head toward the parking lot. The entire school looks deflated. \n \n The game didn't go how you wanted it to. Not at all.\n \n\n[Choice: Go find Luke]",

There's just a dull murmur of voices as people start filing out, none of the deafening cheers and pounding drums there were moments earlier. The opposing team is still celebrating, their players hugging, jumping, and throwing their helmets in the air. Meanwhile, the Pacific Crest Panthers walk off in silence, their exhaustion and disappointment weighing down every step.\n\nYou and Samantha make your way down toward the locker rooms, weaving through the dispersing crowd. The buzz of post-game chatter surrounds you but for you and Samantha, there's only one thing that matters.\n\nLuke.\n\nSamantha lets out a heavy sigh, stuffing her hands into her hoodie pocket. \"Ugh, I hate this part. The whole awkward conversation where we have to reassure the guy.\"\n\nYou glance at her. \"We don't have to talk to him if you don't want to.\"\n\nShe snorts. \"Yeah, like we're going to let him mope alone. Come on, [name]. You know Luke would do the same for us.\"\n\nYou can't argue with her sound logic.\n\nBy the time you reach the locker room entrance, the players have already gone inside, venting their frustration to each other.\n\nLuke is leaning against the wall just outside the entrance, still in his uniform, his helmet resting on the floor. He hasn't even taken his gloves off yet. He stares at the ground, jaw clenched, expression hard to read.\n\nSamantha steps forward first. \"Alright, before you say anything, I want you to know that that was not your fault.\"\n\nLuke lets out a humorless chuckle, finally looking up. \"I didn't say it was.\"\n\n\"Luke, I know you're thinking it,\" she says, crossing her arms. \"And I'm shutting it down.\"\n\nLuke exhales sharply. \"I should've made that. We should've won.\"\n\n\"You almost did,\" you correct.\n\nLuke presses his lips into a thin line. \"Almost doesn't win games.\"\n\nSamantha groans. \"Luke, shut up. Do you want me to start listing all the insane catches you did make tonight? Because I will. Each and every one. Do keep in mind I will be obnoxious about it.\"\n\nLuke snorts, shaking his head. \"Please don't.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank God, you're still capable of human emotions.\"\n\nThat finally gets a real laugh out of him, even if it's small. Luke sighs, finally pulling off his gloves. \"Thanks, guys. Really.\"\n\nYou nod. \"That's what we're here for.\"\n\nLuke leans back against the wall, tilting his head up toward the stadium lights still shining overhead. \"Fuck, I just wanted to win this one,\" he mutters. \"First game of the season, home crowd, everyone watching... it sucks to come up short.\"\n\nYou and Samantha exchange a glance, both knowing this loss stings a hell of a lot more than he's letting on.\n\n\"Yeah, it sucks,\" Samantha admits. \"But it's one game. Not to mention you did your best. The season's not over.\"\n\nLuke nods slowly, letting the words sink in.\n\nSamantha nudges Luke's arm. \"So, are you gonna sit here brooding all night, or are we gonna do something stupid to get our minds off this?\"\n\nLuke raises an eyebrow. \"Define 'stupid.'\"\n\nSamantha grins. \"Hmm, I don't know. Something fun. Something reckless.\"\n\n\"I feel like your definition of reckless is very different from mine,\" you say, sighing.\n\nSamantha completely ignores you, snapping her fingers suddenly. \"I've got it,\" she says, spinning to face both of you. \"You know the Sycamore Park? You know how they have a giant jungle gym?\"\n\nLuke squints at her. \"What's your point, Samantha?\"\n\nShe throws up her hands. \"We climb it.\"\n\nYou stare at her. \"That's your idea of reckless?\"\n\n\"[name], [name], [name]. We are technically too old to be climbing playground equipment. Which makes it forbidden. Pretty reckless if you ask me.\"\n\n\"This conversation is stupid, and we have a lot of stupid conversations.\"\n\nLuke shrugs, smirking now. \"I don't know, man. Climbing sounds kinda fun.\"\n\nYou blink. \"You're agreeing to this?\"\n\n\"I need to move and sitting here thinking about the game isn't going to help at all.\" He looks at Samantha. \"Race you there?\"\n\nSamantha's eyes light up. \"Oh, fuck yes.\"\n\nAnd just like that, they take off, sprinting like two kids on a sugar rush.\n\nYou groan and begin reluctantly jogging after them. \"Why do I know one of us is gonna break something.\"\n\nSamantha cackles over her shoulder. \"That's what makes it fun!\"\n\nYou can't help but laugh as the three of you run, the loss already starting to feel a little less heavy.\n\n[Choice: Run!]",

The jungle gym was a towering fortress, the swings sent you flying higher than you ever thought possible, and the metal slide felt like it went on forever. Now, under the flow of the streetlights, it's just an empty playground in a quiet park. The wood chips are scattered unevenly and the paint on the monkey bars is slightly faded.\n\nBut none of that really matters.\n\nNot to you.\n\nNot to Luke.\n\nNot to Samantha.\n\nLuke and Samantha don't slow down as they reach the jungle gym. Samantha jumps onto the first platform without hesitation, gripping the bars like she's a kid again. \"Alright, losers,\" she calls over her shoulder. \"First one to the top wins. Last one there is a rotten egg.\"\n\nLuke doesn't hesitate before climbing up after her. \"You didn't say go.\"\n\n\"When did I say I play fair?\" Samantha replies, already scrambling up another level.\n\nYou shake your head, but a grin tugs at your lips as you follow. The bars are cool under your hands and the structure creaks slightly under your weight, but there's something oddly familiar about the movement. Something that feels easy.\n\nLuke is already near the top, moving with the kind of effortless coordination you'd expect from an athlete. On the other hand, Samantha is struggling to pull herself onto the highest platform, legs kicking as she struggles to get enough momentum to swing herself up.\n\nLuke watches her for a second before leaning over and extending a hand. \"Need some help?\"\n\n\"I got it, don't worry,\" Samantha insists, twisting awkwardly as she tries to hoist herself up. She finally manages to flop onto the top platform, landing flat on her back. She stares up at the sky, panting. \"I totally meant to do that.\"\n\nYou make it up last, pulling yourself onto the top level and settling into a sitting position, legs dangling over the edge. Luke stretches his arms over his head, looking out at the empty park. \"Man. When's the last time we even came here?\"\n\nSamantha sits up. \"Middle school?\"\n\n\"Yeah, middle school,\" you repeat. \"Back when we thought staying out past sunset made us cool.\"\n\nLuke laughs. \"Hey, that did make us cool.\"\n\nSamantha nudges him. \"Yeah, until we got yelled at for it.\"\n\nThere's a comfortable pause.\n\nThe kind that settles deep in your bones, stretching across the years like a bridge back to simpler times. The three of you sit there, side by side, looking out over the quiet streets. The distant hum of cars, the occasional flicker of a porch light, the warm glow of the streetlamps—it's all so familiar, yet just far enough to feel like another lifetime.\n\nA cold breeze drifts through the playground, rustling the trees and stirring up the scent of wood chips. You breathe it in, and for a second, it feels like nothing's really changed at all. Like you're all kids again, back when nights like this stretched on forever, back when time didn't feel like it was slipping through your fingers.\n\nLuke resists his arms on his knees, starting out at the park with a small, wistful smile. \"Remember when we used to play freeze tag here?\"\n\nSamantha snorts. \"No wonder that's the game you remember, you always won.\"\n\nLuke shrugs. \"I was fast.\"\n\n\"You weren't just fast, you were insanely fast,\" you say. \"I remember you sprinting across the entire playground in, like, two seconds.\"\n\nSamantha points at him. \"You do realize it was a playground game, right? Not the Olympics.\"\n\nLuke chuckles. \"You're just mad I never let you win.\"\n\nSamantha scoffs. \"One of these days, I'm tripping you.\"\n\nYou all go quiet again, listening to the wind and the distant sounds of the world. You remember how this place used to be everything—how a jungle gym could be a castle, how the swings could make you feel like you were flying, how the sandbox was a battleground for the most intense imaginary wars. You remember staying out until the streetlights flickered on, pretending not to hear your parents calling you home just so you could have one more second of freedom.\n\nSamantha sighs, stretching out and staring up at the night sky. \"Man. Why did growing up ruin this?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Luke asks, leaning back on his hands.\n\n\"This,\" Samantha says, gesturing vaguely at the playground. \"Just... being here. It used to be the best thing in the world. We'd come here after school, after practice, after whatever, and just run around like idiots for hours. Now we don't really get that before we start thinking about all the stuff we have to do.\"\n\nYou let her words settle and realize she's right. There was a time when everything you have to deal with now didn't matter. When nights like this were endless and when the biggest problem in the world was deciding who got to seek in hide-and-seek.\n\nLuke exhales, staring up at the stars. \"Hell, maybe we just forgot how to enjoy it.\"\n\nSamantha hums thoughtfully. \"Yeah, maybe.\"\n\nYou close your eyes and let yourself feel it—the wind on your face, the scent of the night air, and the metal bars cool against your skin. You let yourself believe, just for a moment, that you're still ten years old, that tomorrow isn't waiting with responsibilities and expectations. That the only thing that matters is this—the three of you, together, on an old jungle gym under the stars.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nYou open your eyes.\n\nThe world hasn't changed.

Sounds fake.\"\n\nLuke smirks. \"You can stay up here if you want. But if you get stuck, I'm not going to help you down.\"\n\n\"Coward,\" Samantha says, clicking her tongue.\n\nStill, she's the first to move, swinging her legs over the edge and carefully maneuvering her way down the jungle gym's bars.

It's stupid, sure, but a part of you wants to hang onto this moment just a little longer.\n\nBy the time you reach the ground, Luke has already dropped onto one of the wooden benches near the swings, stretching his legs out in front of him with a sigh.

When you finally arrive, Jessica pulls into the driveway of a large, modern house that practically screams comfort and style. The front yard is meticulously kept, with soft outdoor lights illuminating the stone pathway leading to the door.\n\n\"Alright, everyone, welcome to my humble abode,\" Jessica says, stepping out of the car. She unlocks the front door and pushes it open, revealing an inviting interior with high ceilings, plush furniture, and warm lighting.\n\n\"Wow,\" you murmur, stepping inside.\n\n\"Make yourselves at home,\" Jessica says, tossing her keys onto a nearby table. \"Living room's straight ahead. I'll grab the snacks.\"\n\nAs you step into the spacious living room, you notice a massive couch in front of a huge flat-screen TV mounted on the wall. A soft throw blanket is draped over the back of the couch.\n\n\"This place is as insane as I remember it being,\" Mia says, plopping down onto the couch and stretching out. \"Jess, I'm officially moving in.\"\n\n\"You'll have to fight me for it,\" Ashley jokes, settling onto the other end of the couch.\n\nJessica reappears a few minutes later, her arms laden with snacks: bowls of chips, cookies, candy, and a few cans of soda. \"Here we go!\" she announces, setting everything down on the coffee table.\n\nTori grabs a can of soda and cracks it open. \"Alright, so, what's the game plan for tonight? Are we doing movies, games, gossiping? I'm down for all of the above.\"\n\n\"Hmm, [name],\" Jessica says, turning to you with a teasing smile, \"Since this is your first official team hangout, you get to pick what we do first.\"\n\n \n \n \n \n[Choice: Continue]",

The remnants of snacks are scattered across the coffee table—empty soda cans, crumpled chip bags, and an empty bowl of popcorn. The group sprawls lazily across the sectional couch, completely at ease.\n\nJessica stretches her arms over her head, letting out a small yawn. \"Alright, team, I hate to say it, but I think we've officially partied ourselves out,\" she says with a laugh.\n\n\"Speak for yourself, Jess,\" Mia replies. She tries to sound energetic but she's lying flat on her back, head resting against the couch arm. \"I could do this all night.\"\n\n\"Sure, you're the one who started nodding off first,\" Ashley teases.\n\n\"Look, Ash, I was just resting my eyes.\"\n\n\"Alright, let's start cleaning up,\" Jessica says. \"My parents will kill me if they come home to this mess, even if I tell them it was for the sake of team bonding.\"\n\nEveryone groans and gets up, starting to gather up the empty bowls and trash. One girl gathers the cans and throws them away while others wipe down the coffee table. Jessica grabs the throw blanket draped over the couch and folds it before throwing it back into its spot.\n\n\"You good, [name]?\" Jessica asks, giving you a smile as you collect the last of the popcorn.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm alright,\" you reply, feeling oddly at peace. For all the chaos you went through today, it's hard to believe the night has ended on such a comfortable note.\n\n\"Thanks for coming, by the way,\" Jessica adds. \"It really wouldn't have been the same without you. I think the team's better with you on it.\"\n\nYou blink, surprised by her sincerity. \"Thanks. It means a lot to hear that from you.\"\n\nOnce the squad finishes cleaning up, everyone gathers near the door, exchanging hugs and goodbyes. The night air feels cool as you step outside, the world quiet now.\n\n\"Carpool's heading out!\" Tori says, jingling her keys. \"Hop on, I'll give you a ride.\"\n\nYou nod, grateful for the offer, and soon find yourself riding in the back of Tori's car as she drives through the streets with a few other girls. By the time you're dropped off, the house is dark, save for a single porch light. You sigh, placing your head on the doorknob and pushing it open.\n\n[Choice: Finish up after a long day]",

You glance around the room and decide the vibe is just right. \"Okay, hear me out,\" you say, drawing their attention. \"What if we just... talk? You know, catch up on the latest gossip?\"\n\nMia perks up immediately, launching forward. \"Yes! Finally, someone who gets it. Gossip is the best part of nights like this.\"\n\n\"[name]'s throwing us straight into the deep end, huh?\" Jessica says, raising an eyebrow in amusement. \"But we need to set some ground rules if we're doing this. No spreading anything mean or serious, alright? Only fun stuff.\"\n\n\"Yeah, obviously,\" Ashley says. \"We're not just your run-of-the-mill teenage gossips. We're classy gossips.\"\n\n\"Classy?\" a girl laughs, nearly choking on her drink. \"Aren't you the one who tried to spread the rumor that the new girl was actually an alien last year?\"\n\n\"You can't blame me, she did give off alien vibes,\" Ashley responds, completely unbothered. \"Anyway, we've got to focus—who are we dishing about first?\"\n\nEveryone turns to you, waiting for you to pick the target of the night's playful interrogation.\n\n\"It's your call, [name],\" Jessica says, reclining back into the couch. \"You started this, so you've got to pick who we're talking about.\"\n\nYou decide you want to gossip about one of your best friends first.\n\n[Choice: Luke]\n[Choice: Samantha]",

Tall, goofy, always smiling?\"\n\n \"Yeah, that's my best friend, alright,\" you reply. \"The really chill one.\"\n\n Jessica lets out a laugh, shaking her head. \"Luke's the human equivalent of a golden retriever. What's there to gossip about? He's just... Luke.\"\n\n \"Exactly!\" you say, sitting up. \"That's exactly why we should talk about him. He's so happy all the time, I feel like there's got to be something interesting beneath it all that he's not telling me. There's no way someone's that perfect, right?\"\n\n Ashley snorts. \"Oh, [name]. Sweet, naïve, [name]. There's nothing beneath Luke's golden retriever energy because that's literally all there is. I mean, don't get me wrong, the guy's great—but he's about as deep as a kiddie pool.\"\n\n \"Hey, don't be mean,\" Tori chimes in. \"He's a sweetheart.\"\n\n Mia grins, nudging you. \"You know he talks about you constantly, right? He likes you. The guy probably thinks you walk on water or something.\"\n\n \"I don't know about that,\" you say, rolling your eyes. \"Luke probably likes everyone that isn't horrible.\"\n\n Jessica taps her chin thoughtfully. \"I feel like we're missing an opportunity here. Maybe, just maybe, Luke's got a dramatic backstory. Like, what if he's pretending to be all cheerful because... his dad was not a good guy. And he's trying to make everyone happy.\"\n\n Ashley raises an eyebrow, smirking. \"What, like he's going around saving people because he couldn't save himself as a kid? That's way too deep for Luke. The only secret he's hiding is probably how many burgers he can eat in one sitting. He's not exactly layered, you know?\"\n\n The group falls into giggles, the conversation spiraling into increasingly crazy theories. At one point, Mia suggests he's a Russian spy, while Tori insists he's a secret billionaire.\n\n Jessica shakes her head. \"You know, I think Luke's simplicity is part of his charm. he's not some complex character or a walking enigma. He's just... happy. And honestly? That's kind of refreshing.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say with a laugh, realizing the conversation has went from gossiping about Luke to roasting his one-dimensionality. \"Sometimes a golden retriever is just a golden retriever.\"\n\n \n You lean forward, resting your elbows on your knees as a sly smile creeps onto your face. \"Alright,\" you say, glancing around the room. \"What about Samantha?\"\n\n The room goes silent before breaking into a mix of laughter and surprised exclamations.\n\n \"Samantha?\" Jessica says, her eyebrows shooting up. \"[name], you've got guts to gossip about your own best friend. Also, she's the most un-gossipable person ever. What's the tea?\"\n\n \"No one ever talks about Samantha because she's so... she's such a... Samantha,\" Mia says. \"She's got that sarcastic, too-cool-for-drama vibes.\"\n\n \"That just makes her more interesting,\" a girl adds. \"[name], why don't you spill. You know her better than any of us do—what's she been up to?\"\n\n \"I mean, we're friends, but she's not exactly forthcoming about her life, you know?\" you say. \"She acts like nothing ever gets to her, but there's got to be something going on beneath the surface. I've known her for ages now but I still don't feel like I truly know her.\"\n\n \"Totally,\" Jessica nods thoughtfully. \"I've always wondered what her deal is. She's really closed off.\"\n\n \"She's probably too busy coming up with snarky one-liners,\" Tori says with a laugh, popping a chip into her mouth. \"Seriously though, how the hell does she do it? It's like she has a database of insults ready to go at all times.\"\n\n \"Right?\" you laugh. \"She's too quick sometimes.\"\n\n Mia rests her chin in her hand. \"Do you think she's hiding something big? Like a secret crush or a double life?\"\n\n Ashley gasps dramatically, clapping her hands together. \"Oh my God, I knew it! She's like Hannah Montana or something. Or maybe she's secretly in love with someone, and that's why she's so prickly. Who do you think it could be?\"\n\n \"Okay, let's not turn this into some soap opera,\" Jessica says, rolling her eyes. \"But still... she's always so quick to call other people out. I wonder if she's afraid of letting people call her out for once.\"\n\n You think back to all the times Samantha has deflected attention away from herself with a well-timed joke or sarcastic remark. \"She's definitely got walls up,\" you say. \"But I don't think it's about being mean or catty. She's just... careful.\"\n\n \"I mean, you're her best friend, [name],\" Tori says. \"Don't you know anything about her home life?\"\n\n \"I'm not... sure?\" you say, realizing you know a lot less about Samantha than you thought you did.\n \n\nAs the laughter dies down and the conversation wraps up, Jessica stretches out on the couch. \n\n\"That was fun but we're not done yet,\" she says. \"Come on, [name], you're on a roll tonight. Who's next on the Pacific Crest gossip chopping block?\"\n\nThe rest of the squad leans in eagerly, their eyes sparkling with anticipation. You glance around, feeling the squad's excitement radiating toward you. There's a pause as you think about who to bring up next.\n\n[Choice: Jordan]\n[Choice: Vincent]\n[Choice: Aurora]",

Jessica raises an eyebrow, while Mia lets out a small laugh.\n\n \"Jordan?\" Mia asks. \"Jordan the quarterback? Mr. Stoic himself? Oh, this should be good.\"\n\n A girl crosses her arms. \"Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen him talk to anyone unless it's about football or telling someone to move out of the way.\"\n\n \"Exactly,\" you say. \"Doesn't that make him more interesting to talk about? He's the best player on the team, but does anyone actually know anything about him? Like, what's his deal?\"\n\n \"Didn't you talk to him once?\" Mia asks as she nudges Jessica with her elbow. \"During that team dinner thing?\"\n\n \"I tried,\" Jessica says, rolling her eyes. \"He just kept giving me one-word answers. Not exactly a bonding moment.\"\n\n \"Maybe he has a tragic backstory,\" Tori says, shrugging. \"I mean, have you seen the guy? He always looks like he's thinking about the meaning of life or something.\"\n\n You laugh softly. \"Yeah, he's definitely carrying something. He's usually not rude, but there's this... distance, you know? Like he doesn't want anyone getting too close.\"\n\n \"I've heard rumors that his parents are super intense,\" Jessica says, a flicker of understanding crossing her face. \"Like, former athlete intense. If they're the kind of people who think losing is unacceptable...\"\n\n \"That would explain a lot of his behavior,\" a girl adds. \"It's like he doesn't let himself enjoy anything because he's too busy trying not to screw up.\"\n\n \"I guess that's the downside of expectations,\" Jessica says, letting out a small sigh. \"Everyone wants something from you, and no one stops to ask what you want.\"\n\n The room falls quiet for a moment as the lighthearted energy gets replaced by a more reflective mood. You feel a strange sense of curiosity about Jordan, wondering just how much he's not revealing about himself.\n\n Tori breaks the silence with a small laugh, trying to lighten the mood. \"Well, if anyone could crack him, it'd probably be you, [name]. You've got this way of getting people to talk without them realizing it.\"\n\n You chuckle, though part of you wonders if she's right. Maybe there's more to him than anyone realizes.\n\n \n You tap your fingers on your knee as you think until a name pops into your head.\n\n \"What about Vincent?\"\n\n The reaction isn't as loud or excited as before. Instead, there's a pause as the squad processes the name.\n\n \"Vincent?\" Mia repeats, furrowing her brow. \"The kid with glasses? Quiet guy? Barely talks to anyone?\"\n\n \"Yeah, that's him,\" you say, nodding.\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow, intrigued. \"Huh. That's... different. Not gonna lie, I don't think I've ever heard anyone say his name during a gossip session.\"\n\n \"Exactly!\" a girl says. \"Like who even is Vincent? I don't think I've ever seen him hang out with anyone. He's just kinda... there.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" Tori chimes in. \"I mean, I see him in the hallways sometimes, but he's like a ghost. Doesn't talk, doesn't make eye contact, doesn't exist outside of class.\"\n\n \"I didn't even know about him until a couple of weeks ago,\" you shrug. \"He's in my gym class.\"\n\n \"Wait, you actually talked to him?\" a girl asks, her eyes wide. \"What's he like?\"\n\n \"He's a good guy. A little shy, but solid.\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow, intrigued. \"Gym class is an odd place to start a friendship with someone like him. He doesn't really scream 'team sports'.\"\n\n \"He doesn't,\" you agree, a small smile tugging at your lips as you recall how that first interaction went. \"We played pickleball against these assholes who were being rude to Paige.\"\n\n \"Who would be rude to Paige?\" Tori asks, annoyance in her voice. \"What happened?\"\n\n \n \"We won, obviously,\" you say, a smile on your face. \"We shut them up.\"\n \n \n \"I messed up and we lost,\" you say, sighing as you recall that moment.\n \n\n \"It sounds like Vincent warmed up to you pretty fast though, don't you think?\"\n\n \"Pretty much,\" you say, nodding. \"I think he's just... looking for someone to talk to. Someone who doesn't make fun of him or blow him off. He started treating me like we were friends after, like, two conversations. It caught me off guard at first, I'll admit, but...\"\n\n \"But it's kinda sweet, isn't it?\" Mia finishes for you.\n\n \"I guess, yeah,\" you admit. \"I think he doesn't really have many people he can trust, so when he finds someone who's nice to him, he clings to it. He has been a really good friend so far though.\"\n\n \"Well, I'm glad he's found you,\" Jessica says. \"You're probably exactly the type of friend he needs right now.\"\n\n As the conversation shifts and the squad begins chatting about something else, Vincent lingers in the back of your mind. Whatever his story is, you know he deserves at least one person in his corner. For now, maybe you can be that person.\n\n \n You lean back into the couch, smirking as the name comes to you. \"Alright,\" you say, lowering your voice to match the mood you're about to create. \"What about Aurora?\"\n\n The room falls silent almost instantly as if the name itself has power over everyone present.\n\n \"Oh, now you're just being bold,\" Ashley says. \"Like, Aurora? The Aurora? The girl no one ever talks to unless they absolutely have to?\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. \"That's an interesting choice, [name]. To be honest, I've been curious about her too. She's... I don't know, kind of fascinating in her own way.\"\n\n \"Fascinating? More like terrifying,\" Mia interjects. \"That girl gives me chills. She's so quiet and serious all the time, and she's always reading those weird-ass ancient books. Like, what even are those? Grimoires?\"\n\n \"Alright, [name], you brought her up—spill,\" Jessica says, a knowing smile on her face. \"What do you know about Aurora? You don't just pick someone like her at random.\"\n\n You hesitate for a moment, wondering how much to say. You know Aurora isn't just some mysterious girl—she's someone who knows about your curse.\n\n \"She's... different,\" you say carefully, trying to find the right words. \"I feel like she knows things—things other people don't.\"\n\n Ashley snorts. \"Yeah, like how to freak people the fuck out by just standing there.\"\n \n \"You don't think she's actually into magic, do you?\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head, considering it. \"All I'm saying is that it wouldn't surprise me. She has that kind of presence like she's always one step ahead of everyone else. She's said some freaky stuff too.\"\n\n \"She's intimating too, but not in an obvious way,\" a girl says. \"You just know not to cross her. You just feel like she's got something up her sleeve.\"\n\n You nod slowly, remembering the way Aurora had looked at you once. Her piercing purple eyes seemed to see straight through you, like she was looking into you rather than at you.\n\n \"I don't know, I've talked to her a couple of times, she's not what you'd expect, you say. \"She's not mean or anything. Just... different.\"\n\n \"Different how?\" a girl asks. \"Like, does she actually do magic?\"\n\n \"Oh my God, she's a witch,\" Mia says, her eyes practically bugging out of her head. \"She's an actual witch. [name], what's going on? Did you get hexed?\"\n\n \"Calm down,\" Jessica says, snickering. \"You guys are going way too far.\"\n\n For now, you laugh along with the squad. You are a little disappointed that they don't know more though. Aurora will remain an enigma—for now.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Her voice carries an almost theatrical air of amusement, but there's a faint flush in her cheeks that she's not able to hide fast enough. Her eyes flick to you, narrowing as if she's trying to size you up.\n\n \"Guess it's your lucky day, [name],\" she teases, her smile curving just enough to seem playful, though her gaze lingers on you a little too long.\n\n The others start egging her on, cheering and clapping as she leans just the slightest bit forward. You're not sure if it's the lighting or your own nerves, but you think that her expression softens as she gets closer.\n\n You're aware of how close she is, her blue eyes locking onto yours for a moment that feels far longer than it actually is. Her gaze bores into you, almost as if she's searching for something. Maybe she's looking to see if you're nervous too. Or maybe she's just as unsure as you are.\n\n Then, before either of you can hesitate any longer, she closes the distance.\n\n Her lips brush against yours, soft and warm, lingering just a moment longer than they should. The room erupts into cheers and laughter around you, but it all fades into the background. For that fleeting moment, it's just you and her. Jessica and [name].\n\n When she pulls back, her cheeks are definitely flushed, but there's a shy smile on her face that's completely unlike her usual confident smirks. She looks away for a second, running a hand through her ponytail before locking eyes with you again.\n\n \"Well,\" she says, her voice quiet. \"You're not bad at this, huh?\"\n\n The others are still joking and teasing but Jessica seems to tune them out, her gaze lingering on you for just a beat longer. There's something unreadable in her expression before she laughs quickly and leans back. \"Alright, who's next?\" she asks, reclaiming her usual composure. Her tone is light and playful but her fingers fidget briefly with the hem of her skirt as the bottle spins again.\n <<elseif [feminineLooks] > 59 or [d12makeup] > 0>> \n As the bottle slows, your heart thuds in your chest. It finally slows to a stop pointing directly at Jessica.\n\n \"Well, well, well,\" Mia says. \"Our fearless leader is up first. This should be good.\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow, her expression caught somewhere between amused and resigned. She flicks her ponytail over her shoulder and sighs dramatically. \"Alright, rules are rules,\" she says, a teasing lilt in her voice. \"But don't get any ideas, [name]. This doesn't make us a couple or anything.\"\n\n The group laughs at the jab but you catch the faintest flicker of something else in her eyes. It's subtle, gone in a flash, but you can't help but notice it as she shifts her weight and turns toward you.\n\n \"C'mon, [name],\" she says, her tone a little too practiced. \"Let's just get this over with.\"\n\n You nod as you lean in, trying not to overthink it. Your cheeks burn, but Jessica looks perfectly composed. Almost as if she's treating this like a performance. The kiss is quick—a simple peck on the lips, nothing more—but the squad cheers like you pulled off a championship-winning stunt.\n\n \"Whoo! Look at you two go!\" Tori exclaims, clapping loudly. \"First game and first kiss—[name]'s having a night!\"\n\n Jessica pulls back, a distant smile firmly in place. She wipes an imaginary smudge off her lips with the back of her hand and laughs. \"Okay, that's enough excitement for one spin. Who's next?\"\n\n The game continues but Jessica doesn't immediately rejoin the banter. She leans back on her hands, watching the bottle spin again with a calm but detached expression. It's subtle but you notice how she keeps glancing at the others instead of looking at you. She doesn't seem uncomfortable just... unaffected by it all.\n \n \n \n As the bottle slows, the group leans forward in anticipation. Your heart skips a beat when it stops, pointing directly at Jessica. Her confident grin falters for just a moment, replaced by a look of surprise. She recovers quickly, but something about the moment feels off.\n\n Jessica leans back on her hands, a flicker of tension in her eyes as she glances at you. \"Well, looks like it's me,\" she says, noticeably being careful with her words. \"Let's get this over with.\"\n\n Mia gasps dramatically, clapping her hands. \"Oh my God, the captain and the rookie! This is so iconic!\"\n\n \"You better make it good, [name],\" a girl says, winking at you. \"Jessica has high standards.\"\n\n Jessica laughs at that, although it sounds forced. \"Yeah, don't let me down, superstar.\"\n\n You swallow hard, suddenly feeling the weight of the attention on you. You lean in, your face inches from Jessica's, but you can feel how still she becomes when you go for the kiss. Her body tenses ever so slightly, and while she doesn't pull away outright, you can tell she's not entirely comfortable.\n\n The kiss itself is brief—just a quick peck on the lips that's over in a second—but it feels awkward, like something mechanical. Jessica pulls back immediately, giving you a smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes.\n\n \"There,\" she says, brushing her hair over her shoulder as though nothing happened. \"Satisfied?\"\n\n The squad cheers and laughs, oblivious to the subtle undercurrent. Jessica, ever the leader, plays it off perfectly. \"Your turn, Mia. Let's keep this moving.\"\n\n As the group's attention shifts, you glance at Jessica in hopes of a sign that everything's fine. But she avoids your gaze, focusing instead on the bottle as Mia spins it. Her posture is relaxed, but there's something guarded in the way she carries herself now.\n\n The rest of the game continues but you can't shake the feeling that something's changed. Jessica has no problem laughing and joking with the rest of the squad but doesn't address you directly.\n \n\n \n As the bottle slows to a halt, it lands squarely on Mia. Her bright green eyes widen slightly before curving into a playful grin. \"Oh, looks like it's my lucky night,\" she teases.\n\n The squad erupts into laughter and cheers, the energy in the room buzzing with excitement. \"Go on, [name]!\" Jessica urges. \"Rules are rules.\"\n\n You glance at Mia, your heart racing in your chest. There's no pressure in her gaze as she leans forward slightly, resting her chin on her hand. \"Well? Don't keep me waiting,\" she says.\n\n You muster a grin, your cheeks warm, and lean forward across the circle. The distance between you feels like it stretches forever, and for a moment, the noise of the room fades into the background. Mia meets you halfway, her expression softening as she closes the gap.\n\n The kiss is quick and light—just a playful brush of lips, but that's enough to make your pulse race. When you pull back, Mia's grin returns in full force as she flops back against the couch. \"Oh, [name], I think I'm swooning,\" she jokes, fanning herself with one hand.\n\n The squad bursts into laughter again. \"Mia, you're such a drama queen,\" a girl says, tossing a pillow at her.\n\n \"Look, I'm just living in the moment,\" Mia retorts, tossing the pillow back. \"[name]'s a pretty good kisser. I've got to admit that.\"\n \n You feel your cheeks heat up again but Jessica takes control of the moment before you can respond. \"Alright, alright, enough flirting. Whose turn is next?\"\n\n \n The bottle spins and spins, wobbling slightly on the rug as all eyes are fixed on it. Your heart pounds in your chest as it slows down, inching closer to Ashley. When it finally stops, the room falls silent for a second before erupting into laughter and gasps.\n\n Ashley leans back on her hands, a smirk spreading across her face. \"Well, well, well,\" she says. \"Looks like someone's aiming high tonight.\"\n\n The others burst out laughing.\n\n \"Oh my God, [name], bold move!\" Mia exclaims.\n\n \"This is about to get really interesting,\" Jessica adds, shooting you a sly grin.\n\n You feel your face heat up, but barely manage to keep your cool. Ashley watches you with a sharp gaze, clearly enjoying how flustered you are. But beneath her teasing, there's a flicker of genuine amusement in her eyes.\n\n \"Well?\" she asks, sitting up straighter. \"You're not backing out, are you?\"\n\n There's a playful challenge in her voice, like she's testing you to see if you'll rise to the occasion.\n\n You take a deep breath, doing your best to ignore the others' whispers and giggles. \"Backing out? No way,\" you say.\n\n \"Good answer.\"\n\n The room falls quiet again as everyone holds their breath. You close the small distance between you and Ashley, inching toward her. The moment feels oddly surreal, the air charged with a mix of excitement and nerves. When your lips finally meet hers, it's brief but not rushed—a light, fleeting touch.\n\n The second it's over, the room erupts into cheers and whistles.\n\n \"Woohoo!\" Tori says, clapping her hands.\n\n Mia fans herself dramatically. \"Ten out of ten.\"\n\n \"Not bad for a rookie,\" Jessica says with a laugh. \"Ashley, what's the verdict?\"\n\n Ashley leans back, crossing her arms with a mock-thoughtful expression. \"Hmm... I'd say he passed,\" she says.\n\n You let out a breath you didn't realize you were holding, a mix of relief and exhilaration washing over you. Ashley's teasing smile softens and she gives you a small nod.\n\n \"Alright, who's next?\" Jessica says, grabbing the bottle and spinning it herself, sending the group into another round of excited chatter.\n\n \n The bottle slows, spinning lazily as everyone leans in closer. Your heart skips a beat as it finally comes to a stop, the neck pointing directly at Tori.\n\n Her eyes widen for a split second before she breaks out into a soft, easy smile. \"Well, looks like it's me,\" she says, her voice calm but with a tinge of amusement. The rest of the squad erupts into playful hoots and teasing remarks.\n\n \"Ooh, Tori and [name]!\" Mia exclaims.\n\n Jessica smirks, nudging Tori with her elbow. \"Guess we're about to see how your chemistry on the field translates to romance.\"\n\n Tori rolls her eyes at the teasing but doesn't seem fazed. She shifts her weight, turning to face you fully, her hair falling over her shoulder as she tucks it back with a quick motion. \"You good with this?\" she asks like she's giving you an easy out if you want it.\n\n Your nerves are buzzing, but the way she looks at you makes it easier to relax. You nod, managing a smile. \"Yeah, I'm good.\"\n\n Tori leans forward slightly, her movements unhurried. The room goes silent except for the faint sound of a girl suppressing a giggle in the background. You meet her halfway, and while the kiss is quick and soft, it leaves your cheeks warm all the same.\n\n When you pull back, Tori's smile grows. \"Not bad,\" she says.\n\n Before the teasing can go any further, Tori reaches for the bottle and spins it, smoothly redirecting the attention away from the moment. You appreciate her good-natured vibe and the way she made you feel comfortable, though.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

We don't play nice in this house.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Mia adds with a wicked grin. \"No wimpy truths or lame dares. We're going all in.

I dare you to go out in your uniform, run outside, and do a cartwheel in front of the neighbor's house while doing the school chant at the top of your lungs.\"\n\nThe room explodes with laughter, and the girl groans, throwing her head back. \"You're evil. You know that, right?\"\n\nJessica just shrugs. \"Rules are rules, girl.\"\n\nThe girl mutters a string of curses under her breath as she marches off. A few moments later, she's outside, spinning and chanting at full volume while you all peek out the window, nearly crying from laughing so hard.\n\n\"Let's fight, Panthers! Blue and white, we own the night!\"\n\nWhen she comes back, red-faced and panting, she collapses dramatically onto the couch. \"You all are the worst,\" she says.\n\nThe bottle spins again and lands on Mia.\n\n\"Truth or dare?\" a girl asks.\n\nMia doesn't even hesitate. \"Dare. Bring it the hell on.\"\n\n\"I dare you to call Jordan and tell him you think he should try out for the cheer squad because he'd totally rock a skirt.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Mia says, grabbing her phone. \"But if he thinks I've lost my mind, I'm blaming you.\"\n\nYou all fall silent as she dials Jordan's number, putting the call on speaker. When he picks up, his voice is as cold and serious as ever.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Hey, Jordan!\" Mia says, her tone overly chipper. \"So, we were all talking, and I just know you'd kill it as a cheerleader. Like the skirt? That would totally fit your vibe.\"\n\nThere's a long pause on the other end, and then Jordan hangs up without a word. The room explodes into hysterics.\n\nThe bottle spins again and lands on Ashley.\n\n\"Truth or dare?\" Jessica asks.\n\nAshley smirks. \"Dare.\"\n\nJessica taps her chin, clearly plotting something outrageous. \"Okay, I dare you to text your ex and ask if you want to get back together. Right now.\"\n\nAshley's jaw drops. \"Jessica, are you kidding me?! No way!\"\n\n\"You said dare!\" another girl chimes in. \"Rules are rules.\"\n\nWith a dramatic groan, Ashley picks up her phone and starts typing, her face twisted in horror. When she presses send, she gasps.\n\n\"He read it, he read it!\" Ashley says. \"He's replying right now!\"\n\n\"What is he saying?\" Jessica asks, as all of you lean in. Ashley's phone buzzes, a response coming in. Jessica reads it out loud. \"'Ashley, what the fuck?'\"\n\n\"I HATE YOU ALL!\" Ashley yells as the room dissolves into chaos.\n\nFinally, the bottle spins and lands squarely on you.\n\nAll eyes turn to you, their collective grins pure mischief. Jessica rubs her hands together like a cartoon villain.\n\n\"Truth or dare, [name]?\" she asks, her voice dripping with anticipation.\n\nYou hesitate, knowing you're about to walk into the lion's den either way.\n\n[Choice: Dare]\n[Choice: Truth]",

But not just any dress—a cute dress. Like, the cutest thing Jessica owns.\"\n\n The room erupts in laughter, cheers, and gasps of delight.

She holds the dress up with a flourish, and the room collectively gasps. It's a soft, dreamy piece, made of delicate pink fabric with a floral pattern. The puffed sleeves and small bows at the neckline give it a princess-like charm. The sheer layers of the skirt cascade in a flowing design and tiny pearl-like buttons trail down the bodice.\n\n \"This is perfection,\" Jessica says, spinning it slightly so the skirt flutters. \"[name], you're going to look amazing in it.\"\n\n You feel your cheeks heat up as you take in how girly the dress is.

You consider playing it off as a joke for a moment, but their excitement is too much.\n\n \"Well...\" you begin, your voice trailing off as you glance around the room.

I'm not wearing that,\" you declare, shaking your head. \"It's way too... frilly.\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced. \"Oh, come on, [name]. Don't be a baby. It's just a dress—it's not going to kill you.\"\n\n \"Yeah, what's the big deal?\" Mia adds. \"You'll look adorable.\"\n\n \"I don't want to look adorable!\" you sputter, your voice cracking slightly. The room bursts into laughter, and you feel your protests are only making your situation worse.\n\n \"You're so bad at this, [name],\" another girl says, smirking from the couch. \"The more you fight it, the more obvious it is that you're curious. Just admit it—part of you wants to try it on.\"\n\n \"What? No! I don't!\" you insist, taking a step back as Jessica moves closer with the dress.\n\n \"Oh, really?\" Jessica teases. \"Then why are you blushing so much? Not to mention you're stumbling and tripping all over your own words. Look, you've got two options: put it in yourself, or we'll help you. Your choice!\"\n\n Tori cackles. \"You know we're not bluffing.\"\n\n You hold up your hands defensively, but the squad is already closing in. \"Okay, okay!\" you shout, your voice cracking again. \"I'll... I'll do it. Just stop looking at me like that.\"\n\n Jessica smirks triumphantly and tosses you the dress. \"Good choice. Now, the bathroom's right down the hall. Go on. We'll wait.\"\n\n You glance down at the dress in your hands, the soft fabric fluttering slightly as if taunting you. For a split second, you consider booking it for the door—but the squad would probably tackle you before you made it anywhere close.\n\n \"Take your time!\" a girl calls after you. \"We'll be here, imagining how cute you're going to look.\"\n\n As you close the door behind you, you can hear the giggles echoing through the hallway. You glance at yourself in the mirror, then back at the dress. Despite your protests, you can't help but feel curious. You've never worn anything like this before, and you're not sure if you're more embarrassed by the idea of it... or the fact that part of you actually wants to see how it looks on you.\n\n \"Here goes nothing,\" you mutter to yourself.\n\n [Choice: Continue]\n \n \n \n \n \n \n You take a step back, holding up your hands as if to physically shield yourself from the dress. \"Nope. No way. Absolutely not,\" you say, your voice firm and unwavering. \"You can't make me wear that. I don't care how cute it is.\"\n\n The cheerleaders all freeze for a moment, Jessica still holding the dress in mid-air. The room, which had been buzzing with excitement just seconds ago, suddenly feels a lot heavier.\n\n Jessica's grin falters, her arms slowly lowering the dress as she glances between you and the rest of the squad. \"Oh,\" she says, a hint of awkwardness creeping in. \"I mean... it was just for fun.\"\n\n Mia looks at you, her expression dimming. \"Hey, no big deal,\" she says, trying to shrug it off. \"We get it. If you're not comfortable, it's totally fine.\"\n \n Jessica quickly folds the dress, trying to smooth things over. \"We'll just do something else,\" she says. \"It's not a big deal, really.\"\n\n You can tell the group is trying to move past it, but the energy in the room has definitely shifted. The teasing and laughter that filled the air just a minute earlier have been replaced by a slight tension like everyone's trying to figure out how to reset the mood without making you feel worse.\n\n [Choice: Continue]\n \n \n \n \n You glance at the dress a moment longer, feeling your face heat up as everyone waits for your answer. Then, before you can even stop yourself, you blurt out, \"Alright, fine. Let's do this.\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow, her grin widening. \"Wow, no hesitation, huh?\"\n\n \"Yeah, no need to twist his arm,\" Mia says, laughing as she nudges the cheerleader next to her.\n\n \"I mean, if it's for the dare, right?\" you stammer, trying to sound nonchalant but failing. \"rules are rules.\"\n\n Jessica's eyes narrow playfully as she hands over the dress. \"You're surprisingly eager, [name],\" she teases.\n\n \"Don't read too much into it,\" you mutter, though the truth is you're struggling to hide your curiosity. There's a strange flutter in your chest as your fingers brush the soft fabric.\n\n \"Uh-huh,\" Ashley says. \"Just admit it—you're kinda into it.\"\n\n You shake your head. \"I just don't want to lose the game, alright?\"\n\n There's a hum of excitement in the air, the squad exchanging knowing looks as you grip the dress a little tighter than you mean to. For a moment, it feels like they're all in on some joke you haven't caught up to yet. For some reason though, you can't help feeling a bit... excited yourself.\n\n \"The bathroom's down the hall, good luck!\" Jessica exclaims.\n\n [Choice: Continue]\n \n\n \n \n \n \n You glance around the circle, feeling the weight of their expectant stares, and you decide to be honest. You take a breath and nod slightly. \"Yeah, I do,\" you say, keeping your voice steady. \"And... it's a guy.\"\n\n There's a pause for a moment as if the whole squad is processing what you just said. But then Jessica grins, clapping her hands together.\n\n \"Yesss, I knew it!\" she exclaims. \"I mean, come on—look at [name]. He's got taste!\"\n\n Another girl squeals, leaning forward with her elbows on her knees. \"Okay, this just made the game so much better. You're not getting out of this without giving us some hints.\"\n\n \"Alright, spill,\" one says. \"We don't need a name but what's he like? Is he on the football team? Is he cute? Is he tall? Give us something, [name]!\"\n\n You laugh, feeling the heat rise in your cheeks at their relentless enthusiasm. \"Look, I'm not giving you any details,\" you say firmly. \"I'm already regretting picking truth.\"\n\n \"Come on, you're killing us here,\" Mia adds. \"Just one tiny hint? Like, does he at least know you exist?\"\n\n \"Or is this a secret crush situation?\" Jessica presses.\n\n \"You all are relentless, you know that?\" you say, shaking your head. \"No, I'm not giving you anything else.\"\n\n \"Ugh, you're no fun!\" a girl yells out.\n\n \"But [name], if you ever need someone to hype you up or help you make a move, we're here,\" Jessica says, nudging you with a grin on her face. \"You've got the whole cheer squad on your side. You're basically unstoppable!\"\n\n \"Yeah, you've got a team of wingwomen now,\" Tori adds with a wink. \"Not to brag, but we're very good at matchmaking.\"\n\n You can't help but laugh, their acceptance making you feel lighter than you expected.\n\n \"Thanks,\" you say. \"I'll keep that in mind... maybe.\"\n\n \"Maybe?!\" Jessica says. \"More like definitely. There's no 'maybe' about it.\"\n\n The squad continues tossing out ridiculous guesses and half-baked theories about your mystery crush, but it's all in good fun. Even as the game moves on, you can feel their support lingering in the air, making the night feel even more special.\n \n \n \n \n You hesitate, your heart thudding in your chest as all eyes stay locked on you. Finally, you nod slightly, a small smile tugging at the corner of your lips.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you admit, your voice soft but steady. \"It's a girl.\"\n\n The reaction is instant.\n\n \"Oh my God, I knew it!\" one girl shouts.\n\n \"Who is she?!\" Mia blurts out.\n\n Another girl practically squeals. \"This is huge! Okay, you don't have to tell us her name, but we need some details.\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head slightly, her lips curling into a teasing smile. \"So, what's she like? Cute? Smart? Both?\"\n\n You laugh nervously as the whole squad starts firing off questions like it's an interrogation. \"Alright, alright, calm down,\" you say. \"I'm not giving you anything more than that.\"\n\n \"Nooo, come on!\" Ashley groans. \"You can't just drop a bomb like that and leave us hanging.\"\n\n \"You're lucky we don't force you to tell us,\" Tori says. \"But seriously, give us something. Like, does she at least go to Pacific Crest?\"\n\n <<if [jessicaRomance] > 9>> \n Jessica leans back against the couch, her smile softening as she watches you. \"Leave him alone, guys,\" she says, her tone light. \"If he wants to keep it private, that's his choice. Right, [name]?\"\n\n You glance at her, surprised but grateful for the rescue. \"Yeah,\" you say. \"Thanks.\"\n\n There's a flicker of something in her expression—just for a moment, so brief you might've imagined it. A little spark in her eyes, a slight shift in her smile. But before you can dwell on it, she shrugs, tossing a handful of popcorn into her mouth. \"Don't get too comfortable, by the way. I'm still going to figure it out eventually.\"\n \n \n Jessica, who's been quieter than usual, leans back against the couch. \"Fine, we'll back off—for now,\" she says, holding up her hands to call a truce. \"But don't think you're off the hook forever, [name]. I will figure it out eventually.\"\n\n The rest of the group groans but takes Jessica's lead. Jessica winks playfully before popping a piece of popcorn into her mouth, clearly satisfied with her declaration.\n \n \n \n You shrug, feeling the weight of everyone's expectant stares. \"Honestly?\" you begin. \"I'm not crushing on anyone right now.\"\n\n \"What?! No crush? Not even a tiny one?\" Mia groans, flopping dramatically onto the couch as if she's just heard the most tragic news of her life. She grabs a pillow and throws it at you, although it ends up landing harmlessly at your feet.\n\n \"That's so boring,\" Ashley agrees, shaking her head with mock disappointment. \"You're telling me there's not one person at school who's caught your eye? Like, no one?\"\n\n You laugh nervously, holding up your hands defensively. \"What can I say? I'm too focused on cheerleading.\"\n\n Tori giggles, reaching for a handful of popcorn. \"Alright, that's fair. But there's got to be someone you think is cute. Even if it's just a random celebrity or something.\"\n\n Jessica waves them all off, rolling her eyes but smiling. \"Hey, leave [name] alone! Not everyone has to be crushing on someone 24/7. Maybe [name]'s just too mature for us and has other things to worry about.\"\n\n \"Or,\" a girl interjects, \"he's secretly crushing on someone and is just too scared to admit it.\"\n\n \"You guys are relentless,\" you say, shaking your head as the room bursts into laughter.\n\n \"Of course we are,\" Jessica replies, grinning as she tosses a piece of popcorn at you. \"You should've known this would happen when you joined the squad. Welcome to the chaos.\"\n\n \"Ugh, fine,\" Ashley says. \"Hey, he gets the pass—for now. But we will revisit this.\"\n\n Jessica leans forward, spinning the bottle again to move the game along. \"Okay, next victim!\" she says with a wicked grin.\n \n\n [Choice: Keep playing]",

The pink fabric looks almost out of place compared to what you usually wear, but there's something about it that pulls you in.\n\n You sigh, your face already burning with embarrassment. \"They're never going to let me live this down,\" you mutter, pulling the cheerleading top off.\n\n The dress feels impossibly soft as you pull it over your head, the cool fabric brushing against your skin. You fumble with the straps a little, adjusting them so they fit properly on your shoulders. The bodice hugs your torso in a way that feels foreign but not uncomfortable. You smooth the skirt down, the layers of fabric settling around you like a gentle cloud.\n\n <<if [transgender] > 9>> \n Stepping back, you glance at yourself in the mirror, and your breath catches.\n \n You look different.\n\n The floral pattern, the puffed sleeves, the delicate bows—its just all so far removed from anything you'd normally wear. The dress transforms your reflection into something more whimsical, almost like you've stepped out of a fairytale.\n\n Your hands nervously smooth the skirt again, feeling the lightweight layers sway with even the slightest movement. It's... cute. You hate to admit it, especially to yourself, but it's really cute.\n\n You turn slightly, examining yourself from the side. The way the skirt flares out when you move makes you feel oddly graceful, like you're floating. For a moment, you forget about the squad waiting outside and the teasing that's bound to follow. All you can think about is how strange—and fun—it feels to see yourself like this.\n \n \n You glance at yourself in the mirror, and your breath hitches for all the wrong reasons.\n\n The floral pattern, the puffed sleeves, the delicate bows—it all feels so alien, so out of place on you. It's like staring at someone else entirely, someone you don't recognize and definitely aren't sure you want to meet. The dress doesn't just feel wrong—it makes you feel wrong.\n\n You shift uncomfortably, tugging at the straps and fidgeting with the skirt. The lightweight fabric sways with every movement, reminding you of just how out of your element you are.\n\n For a brief moment, you consider taking it off, storming out of the bathroom, and declaring the dare a bust. But it's just a dare, right? It doesn't mean anything.\n\n \"It's fine,\" you mutter to yourself, forcing your hands to stop fidgeting. \"It's just a stupid dress. It doesn't matter.\"\n \n\n A sharp knock on the door makes you jump.\n\n \"[name], you alive in there?\" Tori calls out.\n\n \"I'm fine!\" you shout back.\n\n \"Better hurry!\" Jessica teases.\n\n [Choice: Step out]\n\n \n The bottle spins again, and this time, it lands squarely on Jessica. The room goes wild with cheers and laughter as everyone leans in, eager to see what'll happen.\n\n \"Alright, bring it on,\" Jessica says, grinning confidently. \"Truth.\"\n\n The squad looks at each other, murmuring ideas, but you clear your throat first. \n\n \"Hold up,\" you say, feeling a grin of your own creeping onto your face. \"I'm asking this one.\"\n\n The room erupts in \"ooohs\" as all eyes turn to you. Jessica arches an eyebrow, her smirk unwavering. \"Alright, [name],\" she says, resting her chin in her hand. \"Let's see what you've got for me.\"\n\n You pause for dramatic effect before offering up the question.\n\n [Choice: If you had to date someone on the football team, who would it be?]\n [Choice: Did you ever crush on a cartoon character as a kid?]\n [Choice: Have you ever had a crush on anyone on the cheer squad?]",

Her wide grin shows she's absolutely thrilled with the result. \"[name], you look... adorable. Like, ridiculously cute.\"\n\n Mia claps her hands together, bouncing in place. \"I knew it! I called it! I knew you'd look amazing in that dress. Like, look at you—it's like you were made to wear this.\"\n\n You groan, trying to play it cool as you awkwardly tug at the hem of the dress. \"Alright, alright, you've had your fun. Can I take it off now?\"\n\n \"Absolutely not,\" Jessica says firmly, stepping forward and gently swatting your hands away from the skirt. \"You're not taking it off yet. It looks way too good on you.\"\n\n Another girl crosses her arms, her expression amused. \"It's unfair how cute you look right now. I don't know if even Jessica can wear it after this.\"\n\n Your face burns as you throw your hands up in frustration. \"Okay, enough with all the 'cute' stuff, alright? This is just for the dare.\"\n\n \"Oh yeah, of course,\" Mia says, her tone dripping with sarcasm. \"It's just for the dare, right? Nothing to do with how amazing you look or how much you're secretly enjoying it. Right?\"\n\n You shoot her a glare, but before you can say anything, Jessica steps in. \"Come on, [name], you've got to admit it—you look amazing,\" she says. She takes a second, studying you with an approving smile. \"Actually, you know what? You should keep wearing it. It suits you.\"\n\n \"What?\" you say, blinking at her in disbelief. \"You seriously want me to just... stay in this?\"\n\n \"Why not?\" Ashley asks, shrugging. \"You've already got it on. Might as well own it.\"\n\n Another girl giggles, wanting to join in the teasing. \"You know, you could totally pass for a princess in that dress. [name], the royal cheerleader!\"\n\n \"Stop!\" you groan, burying your face in your hands as the squad erupts into laughter. Despite the relentless teasing, there's no malice in their voices—just a playful warmth.\n\n Jessica pats your shoulder, her tone gentler now. \"Relax, [name]. You're rocking it, I swear. No one here's going to make you feel bad about keeping it on.\"\n\n Her words calm you slightly, and you exhale, letting your hands drop. \"Fine,\" you say, rolling your eyes. \"I'll keep it on. But only because you're all forcing me to.\"\n\n \"Sure, sure,\" Tori says. \"Whatever helps you sleep better.\"\n\n You settle back into the group, still acutely aware of how the dress swishes with every movement, but the atmosphere is so welcoming that you let yourself relax a little. For now, you'll let them have their fun—and, if you're being honest with yourself, you might even be having a little fun too.\n \n \n As soon as you step out of the bathroom, the squad bursts into laughter and cheers.\n\n \"[name], oh my God,\" Jessica says, doubling over as she claps her hands. \"You look so cute!\"\n\n You groan, tugging at the hem of the dress awkwardly. \"Alright, you've had your fun. Can I take this off now?\"\n\n \"No way,\" Mia says. \"You have to at least keep it on for a bit. Rules are rules. And honestly? You're rocking it.\"\n\n \"I hate this,\" you mutter, crossing your arms.\n\n \"Oh come on, it'll be fine,\" Jessica says, patting your shoulder.\n\n You huff, feeling heat crawl up your face as the squad laughs and teases you. Despite their energy, you're counting the seconds until this dare is over.\n \n\n \n \n \"If you had to date someone on the football team, who would it be?\" you ask.\n\n Jessica's grin falters for the briefest of moments when you ask the question. Her confident posture shifts slightly as she bites her lip. The rest of the squad erupts into laughter and squeals of anticipation, clearly thinking you've just thrown her the curveball of the night.\n\n \"Oh my God, [name],\" a girl gasps, clutching her stomach as she laughs. \"That's brutal.\"\n\n Ashley fans herself dramatically. \"This is about to be good. Spill, Jess.\"\n\n Jessica forces a light laugh. \"Wow, you really went for it, huh?\" she says.\n\n \"Come on, Jess, you have to answer,\" Tori says, leaning forward eagerly. \"it's the rules!\"\n\n Jessica hesitates, her eyes darting around the room. Finally, she leans back, crossing her arms in mock exasperation. \"Alright, fine. If I absolutely had to date someone on the football team...\" She pauses dramatically.\n\n \"Probably Luke,\" she blurts out finally, sounding forced.\n\n The room explodes with laughter and cheers.\n\n \"Luke?!\" a girl shrieks. \"Oh my God, you'd destroy him! He's, like, the goofiest guy on the team.\"\n\n \"Yeah, but he's, like, sweet,\" Jessica says quickly. \"And funny. I think.\"\n\n Mia giggles. \"Okay, but can you imagine Luke trying to have a deep, meaningful conversation? So, uh, do you like... football?\"\n\n The room dissolves into another round of laughter, and the entire squad teases Jessica. Jessica takes it for a while, but eventually leans over to grab a handful of popcorn, clearly trying to signal the end of her turn. \"Alright, can we move on now? Or are we going to keep psychoanalyzing my nonexistent football romance?\"\n\n \"Fine, we'll move on,\" Mia says, rolling her eyes.\n \n\n You grin mischievously, the perfect question forming in your mind. Jessica narrows her eyes at you, sensing trouble.\n\n \"Alright,\" you say, trying to sound as casual as possible. \"Did you, Jessica Sanders, ever have a crush on a cartoon character as a kid?\"\n\n The room bursts into laughter and excited reactions.\n\n \"Good one, [name]!\" a girl exclaims.\n\n Jessica freezes for a moment, caught off guard, before leaning back and putting on an air of confidence. \"Oh please. Like I'm going to get embarrassed by that question. Everyone crushed on a cartoon character as a kid.\"\n\n \"Well, then spill!\" Mia urges. \"Come on, Jess. Who was it?\"\n\n Jessica rolls her eyes and crosses her arms. \"Okay, fine, but don't laugh,\" she starts. \"When I was, like, seven, I might've had a tiny crush on... Starfire. From Teen Titans.\"\n\n The room goes quiet for a moment and then erupts into playful chaos.\n\n \"Starfire?!\" a girl laughs. \"Oh my God, I can totally see that.\"\n\n \"Well, she is pretty cute, though,\" Ashley says, nodding thoughtfully. \"I mean, she's got the whole sweet, bubbly thing going on. i get it.\"\n\n Jessica's rambling starts before she realizes what she's doing. \"Right? Like, she was so nice and kind of innocent but also badass when she needed to be. Plus, her hair was amazing, and she had that cute way of talking with, like, the weird phrases and—\"\n\n She stops mid-sentence, her eyes going wide as she realizes how much she's just said. The room falls into a brief, stunned silence, and you can see the faintest flicker of panic on her face.\n\n \"Uh, I mean... who didn't have a crush on Starfire, right?\" she blurts out, her voice suddenly louder and overly casual. \"She's, like, objectively cool, and, um, it's not weird or anything. Everyone thought she was cute, no?\"\n\n Jessica fumbles with a piece of popcorn, popping it into her mouth as if that will somehow erase the last 30 seconds.\n\n Ashley raises an eyebrow, a smirk playing on her lips. \"Jessica, you just talked about Starfire like she was your soulmate.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" Mia chimes in, her grin mischievous. \"Is there something you wanna share with the class, Ms. Sanders?\"\n\n Jessica laughs—too loudly—and waves them off. \"No, no, no. You guys are just reading into things way too much. It was just a dumb childhood thing.\"\n\n She looks around, her smile strained, but nobody presses her further. The teasing simmers down, though you notice her glancing around nervously. For a moment, you think about saying something, but the game spins on, and the attention shifts to the next person.\n \n \n You try your best to keep your expression neutral, though you're grinning on the inside. \"Alright, Jessica,\" you say, locking eyes with her. \"Have you ever had a crush on anyone on the cheer squad?\"\n\n <<if [jessicaRomance] > 9>> \n Jessica's grin falters ever so slightly, and she doesn't look quite as confident as she usually does. The room erupts in gasps and laughter at your question, with Mia practically falling off the couch.\n\n The queen bee laughs nervously, brushing a stray strand of blonde hair from her face as she straightens up on the couch. \"Wow, [name],\" she says, keeping her tone light. \"Way to hit me with the big guns, huh?\"\n\n You shrug, trying to maintain an innocent facade. \"You said to bring something juicy.\"\n\n The group is fully focused on her now, their anticipation thick in the air. Jessica shifts slightly, her fingers fidgeting with the hem of her sleeve.\n\n \"But no, I don't have a crush on anyone here,\" Jessica says, her voice having the slightest tremble.\n\n \"Lame,\" Mia complains.\n\n \"Hate to break it to you, but I'm enjoying the single life,\" Jessica says. \"Hey, blame [name] for asking a bad question. He should've known I'm immune to this.\"\n \n \n The room explodes immediately as the squad whoops in excitement.\n\n Jessica, to her credit, keeps her cool. \"First of all, no,\" she says, holding up a hand like she's silencing a courtroom. \"I've never had a crush on anyone on the squad.\"\n\n The room groans in exaggerated disappointment.\n\n \"Lame,\" Mia complains.\n\n \"What do you guys think this is, some kind of soap opera?\" Jessica snorts. \"Like I'm secretly pining over one of you? Please. As if. Like, the squad is family. Do you have a crush on your cousins? No? Exactly.\"\n\n \"You're letting us down, Jessica,\" Tori jokes, shaking her head in disappointment.\n\n Jessica shrugs, grinning as she grabs a handful of popcorn. \"Hey, blame [name] for asking a bad question. He should've known I'm immune to this.\"\n \n \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

The kind of feeling where you're not sure if you woke up naturally or if something woke you up.\n\nEverything is still quiet except for the distant hum of the world waking up outside. There wasn't an alarm or some other noise that woke you up. It's just you, lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, feeling like the universe is holding its breath.\n\nThen your phone buzzes.\n\nIt's just one buzz. Short. Deliberate.

It's just a command. Simple and direct, sure, but a little unsettling.\n\nYou would usually brush it off, roll over, and go back to sleep. But instead, a wave of... something rolls over you—a pull, a weight, a whisper in the back of your mind telling you that you need to go.\n\nYou don't remember exactly when you decided to move, but you're suddenly on your feet, slipping out of bed. The air in your room feels heavier, like a storm is about to break. You're headed to the door in an instant, the grogginess that you felt a few seconds ago disappearing.\n\nOutside, the air is crisp and fresh, the kind that wakes you up completely. The world is waking up—birds chirping, leaves rustling—but none of it matters to you. Your eyes are already drawn to the woods, standing quiet and steady in the distance.\n\nThe pull that you feel isn't weird or wrong, it just feels inevitable. Like something you have to do.

The air carries a different feeling here. It's more charged, more alive.\n\nAnd you just know that Aurora is waiting for you.\n\nThe further you walk, the more the feeling intensifies, humming beneath your skin like something unseen is guiding you forward. And then, after a few more steps, you spot her.\n\nAurora stands near an old, gnarled tree, arms crossed as she watches you with her usual unreadable expression. She doesn't look surprised to see you here, if anything, she looks like she expected you to arrive the moment you did.\n\n \n Next to her, perched on a moss-covered rock, is Milo.\n\n You recognize him instantly—his messy brown curls, the constant, restless energy humming beneath his skin, and the way he always seems to be on the verge of bouncing off the walls. You've spent enough time with him in the first Occult Club meeting to know that if Milo is involved, things are about to get weird.\n\n The second he spots you, he launches to his feet, practically vibrating. \"Oh, finally! I was this close to sending a search party for you, [name].\"\n\n Aurora exhales through her nose, unimpressed. \"Milo, it's the crack of dawn.\"\n\n \"Exactly!\" Milo says, spinning toward her. \"The best time for magic is before the world is fully awake.

Prime condition for learning new things.\"\n\n Aurora shoots him a flat look. \"Or, it more likely means he's not awake enough to argue with you.\"\n\n Milo shrugs. \"Same thing.\"\n\n \n Next to her, perched on a moss-covered rock, is a boy you don't recognize.\n\n He's younger than both of you, clearly a freshman or sophomore, and has messy brown curls and a wide grin. His clothes are slightly rumpled, like he never stands still long enough to fix them. His eyes have a light that buzzes with energy. The moment he sees you, he hops to his feet, bouncing on the balls of his shoes like he can't contain himself.\n\n \"Oh, finally!\" the boy says, throwing his hands up. \"I thought you were gonna sleep forever!\"\n\n Aurora exhales through her nose, unimpressed. \"Milo, it's the crack of dawn.\"\n\n \"Exactly!\" Milo says, spinning toward her. \"The best time for magic is before the world is fully awake. That's just how it is, everyone knows that.\"\n\n Aurora lifts an eyebrow. \"Do they?\"\n\n \"Well, I don't know, but they should.\"\n \n\nYou take a second to take in the scene. Magic. That's what this is all about. That's why you were drawn here, why you felt the need to come.\n\nYou look at Aurora. \"So... what's this?\"\n\nShe tilts her head slightly, watching you carefully, almost like she's assessing how much you're ready to hear. \"I suppose this is where you start understanding what's happening to you.\"\n\nYour stomach tightens.

I'm just being honest here!\"\n\nYou glance between them, your heart beating a little faster. \"So, are you going to tell me what's going on?\"\n\nAurora holds your gaze for a moment before nodding. \"Yes.\"\n\nMilo claps his hands together, vibrating with excitement. \"This is gonna be so much fun.\"\n\nYou're not sure if fun is the word you'd use here.

She's been around forever, and no one really knows where she came from. She's creepy, dude. It's like she sees into your soul.\"\n\nAurora crosses her arms. \"She doesn't curse people for no reason.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" You let out a dry laugh. \"Because it kind of felt like she did.\"\n\nAurora shakes her head. \"Madame Serena doesn't waste magic on random acts of revenge. Especially with how strong the spell she put on you is. There was a purpose to what she did to you. Even if she didn't explain it.\"\n\n\"So what, she cursed me as a lesson? A punishment? What is it?\"\n\n\"Maybe. Or maybe she saw something in you that you haven't seen yet, [name].\"\n\n\"The mirror will reveal your truth.\"\n\nYou exhale. \"I already talked to her. She said she can't undo the spell.\"\n\n\"That's not why I called you here,\" Aurora says, holding your gaze. \"If Madame Serena can't undo the spell, I certainly can't. I'm here to give you answers.\"\n\nMilo perks up. \"That's why we're here!\" He gestures between himself and Aurora. \"You've got so much to learn first.\"\n\nYou glance at Aurora. \"Learn what, exactly?\"\n\nShe tilts her head slightly. \"About magic.\"\n\nThe word hangs between you, heavy with meaning.\n\nMilo grins. \"And trust me—you're gonna love this part.\"\n\n[Choice: Get your first lesson]",

He still bounces on his heels though, clearly eager for whatever's about to happen next.\n\n\"So what is it then?\" you ask, crossing your arms.\n\n\"It's an interaction. A connection. It's about taking something you can't see and shaping it into something useful.\"\n\n\"That's really vague.\"\n\n\"That's because it is vague,\" Milo explains. \"Magic's different for everyone. You could give the same spell to ten different people and get ten different results. It all depends on how you work with it.\"\n\n\"The spell that's on you right now is magic,\" Aurora adds. \"It's affecting you because it follows rules you don't quite understand yet. If you want to break or control it, you need to start learning those rules.\"\n\nThe idea of breaking the curse makes something inside you stir. \n \n You're desperate to finally understand what's happening to you and maybe break this curse soon.\n\n \n You don't want to break the curse, weirdly enough.\n \n\n\"Magic has different aspects, different ways it can be used.

Consider this a foundation.\"\n \n\n\"So, how are we going to do that?\"\n\nMilo claps his hands together, launching into an explanation. \"We have options!\" He starts ticking them off using his fingers. \"One—straight-up mana control. Can you even move magic without exploding? Two—spellcraft. Can you actually construct something, even a simple sigil or charm? What was I on again? Oh, I remember! Three—ritual knowledge. Can you recognize or understand basic magical symbols and processes? And four—mystical stamina. How long can you actually keep up with all this before your brain turns into soup?\"\n\n\"Not literally,\" Aurora clarifies. Then, after a beat. \"Well...

The morning sun has climbed higher, the golden sun filtering through the trees shifting as the hours slip by.\n\n You've tried everything you wanted to, and by the time you finish, you're barely holding yourself up. You lean against the nearest tree, breath coming in slow, heavy exhales.

I can still—\"\n\n \"No, you can't,\" her voice is steady, sharp in that way that leaves no room for argument. \"Look, [name], even you have limits. If you push yourself further you'll burn yourself out, and that's not going to help anyone.\"\n\n You want to argue, but she's right.

But the further you go, the more you feel it. There's something shifting, something different. The air is heavier, charged in a way that makes your skin prickle.\n\nMilo walks beside you, still buzzing with energy despite all the magic you'd thrown around earlier. \"Alright, so, fair warning—Amber is intense.\"\n\nAurora shoots him a look. \"She's not intense.\"\n\n\"She's kind of intense,\" Milo argues. \"In, like, a badass older sister kind of way. Which, to be clear, is a compliment.\"\n\nYou glance between them. \"Who is Amber?\"\n\nAurora doesn't answer. The trees part ahead, revealing another small clearing. Leaning against one of the trees, arms crossed, is Amber.\n\nAmber is tall, taller than you, with auburn hair in a messy bun. A couple of loose strands frame her sharp features. She's dressed in a cropped leather jacket over a tank top, ripped jeans, and a pair of combat boots that look like they've seen actual battle. She radiates a kind of confidence that comes from knowing exactly who you are and not giving a fuck about anyone else's opinion on it.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nShe tilts her head as you approach, looking you up and down like she's sizing you up. Then, without missing a beat—\n\n\"So you're the kid with the gender curse.\"\n\nYour brain short-circuits. \"Uh—\"\n\nAurora sighs. \"Amber.\"\n\n<<if [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n \"What?\" Amber smirks, standing up straight. \"That is what's happening, right?\" She looks at you again, raising an eyebrow. \"Serena did a real number on you, huh?\"\n\n \n \"What?\" Amber smirks, standing up straight. \"That is what's happening, right?\" She looks at you again, raising an eyebrow. \"Looks like it hasn't changed you much though.\"\n \n\nYou blink, still processing the sheer confidence this woman has. \"You know about my curse?\"\n\nAmber waves a hand. \"Aurora told me. Word gets around in our little community when someone gets hit with magic they didn't ask for. Figured I'd check you out.\"\n\n\"And why do you care?\" you ask, crossing your arms.\n\n\"Why?\" Amber grins. \"Because I've been where you are.\"\n\nThat makes you pause.\n\nAmber casually hops onto a stump, stretching her legs out in front of her. \"I was fourteen when I first used magic to change my body. Took me a while to get it right, but I did. Haven't looked back since.\"\n\nYou stare at her. \"Wait. You transformed yourself? Permanently?\"\n\n\"Yeah, of course,\" Amber says, shrugging. \"Why deal with waiting lists and insurance bullshit when you can just do it yourself? Magic is very convenient when you know what you're doing.\"\n\nYou try to wrap your head around that. Hearing Amber talk about it so casually, like it's as easy as changing your clothes, like it's normal—\n\nIt makes your stomach twist.\n\nAmber must see something in your face because she leans forward, resting her arms on her knees. \"Relax, kid. I'm not saying you have to do anything. You're not trans, right?\"\n\nYou nod slowly.\n\nAmber shrugs. \"Then cool. This isn't your path. But I thought you should know—magic and gender? Not a new combo.\" She smirks. \"You wouldn't believe how many people before you have bent the rules of reality to make their bodies feel right. Hell, half the witches I know have done something with their looks.\"\n\n\"Amber is kind of the resident expert on this stuff,\" Milo states, grinning.\n\nAmber turns back to you. \"So, let's make this a two-way street.

The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and pine, the morning warmth giving way to the cool shade under the canopy.\n\nYou're still exhausted, but you push through it, following Aurora as she leads you along an almost invisible path through the undergrowth. Milo chatters beside you, still riding the high of everything you just pulled off.\n\n\"I mean, seriously, [name], do you even realize how ridiculous that was? No one just knows magic like that. Don't even get me started on how—\"\n\nAurora flicks her fingers, and Milo suddenly clamps his mouth shut, looking personally offended as if he's been betrayed.\n\n\"You'll get your energy soon enough,\" Aurora says over her shoulder. \"But for now, I want you to meet someone.\"\n\nYou frown, stepping over a root. \"Who?\"\n\n\"Amber,\" Aurora says simply.\n\nYou hear her before you can even see her.\n\nA voice—cool, confident, effortlessly cool.\n\n\"So this is the prodigy I've been hearing about?\"\n\nYou glance up, and there she is—leaning against a tree with her arms crossed, one ankle resting over the other. She looks effortlessly composed, like she's been waiting for this moment but wasn't in any rush.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nAmber is tall, taller than you, with auburn hair in a messy bun.

She radiates a kind of confidence that comes from knowing exactly who you are and not giving a fuck about anyone else's opinion on it.\n\nHer eyes sweep over you, assessing—not in a judgmental; way, more like she's measuring something about you. Noticing things you don't even know about yourself yet.\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" she says, voice teasing. \"Just confirming a suspicion.\"\n\nYou frown. \"What suspicion?\"\n\nShe grins, tilting her head slightly and extending a hand. \"Amber. I do magic, I don't take shit, and I heard about you from Aurora.\"\n\nYou shake her hand, feeling her firm and steady grip. When she lets go, she shoves her hands into her jacket pockets and leans back slightly, studying you again.\n\nAurora exhales sharply. \"Amber.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You could introduce yourself without making it dramatic.\"\n\nAmber snorts. \"That was the normal version.\" She turns back to you, smirking. \"Anyway, like I was saying—I had a suspicion about you, and now I'm pretty sure I was right.\"\n\nYour stomach tightens slightly. \"Right about what?\"\n\nAmber's expression doesn't change, but there's something intentional in the way she watches you. It's like she's choosing her words carefully.\n\n\"You're dealing with magic that's messing with your body,\" she says. \"I've been there.\"\n\nYou blink. \"You—?\"\n\nShe gestures vaguely to herself. \"Let's just say I've had my share of experiences with magic and, uh, personal adjustments.\" A hint of a smirk plays at her lips. \"It's useful when you know how to work with it.\"\n\nThere's a beat of silence as you process that. She doesn't elaborate or make a big deal out of it. She just lets it settle between you.\n\nMilo, completely oblivious to the sudden weight in the conversation, bounces on his heels. \"Amber's really good at this stuff, by the way. Not just magic, but like, figuring people out. It's kinda freaky.\"\n\nAmber waves him off. \"Please. It's not freaky, it's just experience.\" She looks back at you, expression still relaxed, still unreadable. \"But I get it. When magic gets involved in this kind of thing, it's never simple. And most people don't get it either.\"\n\n\"You think you get my situation?\" you ask.\n\nAmber shrugs. \"Not completely, no. That's your business. I just know what it looks like when magic is tangled up with identity.\"\n\nYou're not sure why, but her words make your chest feel tight.\n\nAurora cuts in. \"Amber's not here to figure you out, [name]. She just wanted to meet you.\"\n\n\"Yeah, Aurora doesn't talk about anyone unless they're worth knowing,\" Amber says, smirking. \"So I'm here to see what you're all about.\"\n\nMilo gasps. \"Wait, is this a vibe check?!\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" Amber deadpans.\n\nAurora pinches the bridge of her nose. \"You could have just said you wanted to talk to him.\"\n\nAmber ignores her, turning back to you. \"So, let's make this a two-way street.

The few of us who do know don't exactly go around advertising it.\"\n\n Milo flops down onto a fallen log, clearly invested in this conversation. \"So, how did you figure it out?\"\n\n Amber hums as she thinks. \"It wasn't just one big moment. No dramatic revelation, no ancient spellbook falling into my lap. It was more like... a bunch of little things stacking up. Things that didn't feel like they fit until they did.\"\n\n She shifts her weight. \"I always knew something was off about me. But magic? That came later. I started out with the small stuff—protection charms, sigils, dumb little spells to make my hair grow faster because I was impatient as hell. At first, I didn't even connect the two things. Magic was just... there. A thing I was good at. Something that made sense when nothing else did.\"\n\n You listen carefully and realize that it's not just about magic. It's about her.\n\n Amber continues. \"The real shift happened when I started experimenting with transformation spells. Most witches play around with it—glamours, illusion work, stuff like that. But I kept pushing. I wasn't interested in looking different for a few hours. I wanted something real.\"\n\n You swallow. \"And it worked?\"\n\n Amber exhales through her nose, a faint smile on her face. \"Not all at once, no. I screwed up a lot before I figured out what I was doing. There were days where things just felt wrong—where I didn't get the spell right or it faded too soon.\" She shakes her head. \"But then one day, I got it right. And I knew there was no going back.\"\n\n You can't help but stare. \"So... you just changed?\"\n\n Amber's smirk returns, this time sharp and sure. \"Nah, I became.\"\n\n The words settle in your chest, heavy and undeniable.\n\n Milo, kicking his feet where he sits on the log, lets out a low whistle. \"That's so cool.\"\n\n Amber laughs. \"Yeah, well. Took a while to get here. But the point is—magic isn't about forcing yourself into something new. It's about finding what was already there and letting it be.\"\n\n Your thoughts spin, and you don't know what to say, what to think.\n\n \n You glance between them, picking up on the way Aurora's expression has been just a little tighter since Amber arrived. It's subtle—anyone who didn't know her might miss it—but there's a tension there. Not hostility, exactly. More like restraint.\n\n Amber, on the other hand, looks perfectly relaxed. It's like she's enjoying some kind of inside joke you're not in on yet.\n\n \"So,\" you say, tilting your head, \"what's your deal with Aurora? You two seem... interesting together.\"\n\n Aurora exhales sharply. \"[name], don't.\"\n\n Amber grins, completely ignoring her. \"Ah. I see you're perceptive.\"\n\n Milo, who has been mostly bouncing with excess energy this whole time, perks up at the question. \"Ohhh, this is my favorite topic.\"\n\n Aurora shoots him a warning glance. \"Milo—\"\n\n \"No, no, let him talk,\" Amber interrupts. \"I want to see how he explains it.\"\n\n Milo claps his hands together like a kid about to reveal a huge secret. \"Okay, so technically, they're not friends—\"\n\n Aurora crosses her arms. \"Because we're not.\"\n\n \"—but they totally are!\" Milo continues, completely undeterred. \"Amber acts like she's too cool for everything, but she always shows up when Aurora needs something. And Aurora pretends she doesn't like her, but she never tells her to leave. And one time, I swear, swear, I caught them getting coffee together.\"\n\n \"Milo. Stop talking.\"\n\n Milo mimes zipping his lips, but he's beaming.\n\n You raise an eyebrow at Amber. \"So what's your version of this?\"\n\n Amber's grin widens. \"Oh, I love that you asked.\" She gestures toward Aurora, completely unbothered by the dagger-like glare she's receiving. \"See, our dear, enigmatic Aurora has such a specific vibe. You know what I mean, all brooding stares, vague cryptic messages, appearing in the corner of dark rooms for dramatic effect.\"\n\n Milo cackles. \"Oh my God, she does!\"\n\n Amber does not stop. She's clearly on a roll now.\n\n \"Like, let me guess,\" Amber continues, looking at you now. \"When she first talked to you about magic, she probably said just enough to make it feel important but not quite enough for you to understand what the hell she meant, right?\"\n\n You blink, surprised by the accuracy. \"Yes!\"\n\n \"Classic Aurora,\" Amber says, mock-sagely. \"She could explain things, but no, no, that would be too simple. Instead, she says stuff like 'you must learn to see beyond the veil' or 'magic is not something to be taught, but something to be understood'.\" She deepens her voice, lowering it into a dramatic whisper. \"'The answers you seek lie within'.\"\n\n Milo is wheezing at this point.\n\n \"I do not sound like that,\" Aurora mutters, unimpressed.\n\n \"Aurora, you are that. You were born that.\"\n\n Aurora visibly regrets inviting you here.\n\n Milo, still gasping, chimes in, \"No, but for real, she does do that! Last week, I asked her if a spell was dangerous, and she just said 'all things have a cost' and walked away.\"\n\n Aurora sighs. \"I don't have to justify myself to any of you.\"\n\n Amber grins. \"Of course not. Your mysterious ways need no explanation.\" She leans toward you conspiratorially, as if she's telling you a secret. \"Don't take it personally, by the way. This is just how she is. If you ever want a real answer, you have to corner her and demand it.\"\n\n \"Or just let her monologue until she thinks you figured it out!\" Milo adds.\n\n Aurora looks at the sky like she's praying for patience. \"[name], let's move onto another topic before I hex both of them.\"\n\n Amber smiles, clearly pleased with herself.\n\n \n You watch Amber for a moment, taking in the way she carries herself—relaxed, effortless, like nothing could shake her. It's not the fake kind of confidence, not the overcompensating kind. It's real. The kind that comes from someone who's fought their battles and came out victorious.\n\n And you wonder if she's always been like this.\n\n So you ask. \"Were you always this confident?\"\n\n Amber pauses for just a fraction of a second, and you know immediately that the answer is no.\n\n She tilts her head slightly, smirking. \"What do you think?\"\n\n You shrug. \"Well, nobody comes out of the womb knowing exactly who they are.\"\n\n That gets a quiet chuckle out of her. She leans against the tree again, crossing her arms, and for the first time since you met her, she doesn't answer right away. She's thinking. Not in a careful kind of way but like she's sifting through old memories, deciding which ones are worth bringing to the surface.\n\n Finally, she exhales, rolling her shoulders like she's shaking something off. \"No,\" she admits. \"I wasn't always like this.\"\n\n She kicks the dirt lightly with the toe of her boot, gaze drifting slightly past you. It's like she's looking at something that isn't there anymore. \"Took me a while to figure my shit out. And even longer to stop caring what people thought about it.\"\n\n Her voice stays casual, but there's something under it.\n\n Milo flops onto a nearby log, chin in his hands. \"You never talk about this, Amber.\"\n\n Amber smirks. \"I don't do personal, Milo. But [name]'s got those big, sad eyes, and I guess I'm feeling generous.\"\n\n \"Wow.\" You roll your eyes. \"Thanks.\"\n\n She chuckles but continues. \"When I was younger, I spent a lot of time second-guessing myself. Watching how people reacted to me. I wondered if I was doing it right—if I was walking right, talking right, existing the way people expected me to. It was... exhausting, to say the least.\"\n\n Amber lifts a hand and gestures vaguely. \"Then I figured magic could change my body. That was huge, I won't lie. It helped a lot. But it didn't fix me because there was nothing to fix. Magic got my body in the right place, but confidence?\" She taps her temple. \"That part was all on me.\"\n\n She glances back at you, eyes sharp, making sure you're listening. \"Look, [name]. Nobody hands you confidence. You don't just wake up one day and have it. You have to choose it, over and over, until it sticks. Until it's just who you are.\"\n\n You sit with that for a moment. It's not some grand, inspirational speech. It's just a fact.\n\n \"So, yeah. I got here eventually. And now? I'm that bitch.\" She flicks imaginary dust off her jacket. \"But it was a long road, and I had to walk it myself.\"\n\n You nod, thinking her words oer. Amber lets the silence settle, letting you process instead of filling the space.\n\n Then, after a moment, Milo blurts, \"Okay, but, like, when did you become cool?\"\n\n \"I was always cool, Milo,\" Amber says, barking out a laugh. \"It just took everyone else a while to catch up.\"\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]",

The humor from a moment ago fades, replaced by something more serious.\n\n\"We're done messing around,\" Aurora says. \"It's time to see how much control you really have.\"\n\nAmber stretches her arms over her head, rolling her shoulders. \"Yup, she's right. The show's over. Time for the real fun.\"\n\nYou frown. \"Control?\"\n\nAurora nods. \"You've already started adjusting to the spell. Your face and your upper body—you've felt the changes. You've guided them.\"\n\nYour stomach tightens as you realize she's right. The shifts in your appearance haven't been random, not at all. They happened under your influence—your intent. \n\nAmber steps forward, tilting her head. \"But right now, you're only working with half your body. Time to fix that.\"\n\nYou glance between them. \"So... you're saying I can change my lower body now?\"\n\n\"It's more like we're letting you,\" Amber corrects. \"We're just unlocking the next part.\"\n\nAurora watches you carefully. \"You've proven you can handle it. And if you ever want to break this spell completely—or master it—you need full control over it first.\"\n\nMilo, who's been bouncing excitedly on the sidelines, finally speaks up. \"This part is gonna be so cool. Just saying.\"\n\nYou exhale, shifting your feet. \"Alright, how does this work?\"\n\nAmber grins. \"Oh, it's simple. We just tweak the magical framework a little, loosen the restrictions, and let you do your thing.\"\n\nAurora lifts a hand. \"You'll feel it the second it happens. The energy will open up inside you, like a door unlocking. And after that... it's up to you.\"\n\nYou swallow hard, your pulse picking up. You don't know why you're nervous, you really don't. You've already done this before, already felt the shift in your body, already experienced the way the magic wraps around you, waiting for direction. But somehow, this feels bigger.\n\nAmber snaps her fingers and Aurora mutters something under her breath.\n\nYou feel it.\n\nA rush of energy floods through you, curling around your spine, seeping into your skin, your muscles, even your very bones. It's not painful, not jarring—just a shift, like something inside you has clicked into place. A door unlocks.\n\nYour breath catches.\n\nAmber smirks. \"There it is.\"\n\nAurora lowers her hand. \"It's yours now. Use it.\"\n\nYou don't need to be told twice. You close your eyes, letting yourself sink into the feeling. The energy hums inside you, waiting, responding to your thoughts, your intent. You can guide it.\n\nYou can choose.\n\n[Choice: Transform]",

You're almost there.\"\n\nAmber crosses her arms. \"Yeah, you're real close. But you've still got two things left hanging—your height and your voice.\"\n\n\"Why those two?\" you mutter, your stomach twisting slightly.\n\nMilo jumps in, still bouncing slightly. \"Think about it! A person's height changes how they take up space, and how they interact with the world. And your voice? That's huge! People connect the voice to identity all the time.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" you say, rolling your shoulders. Milo's explanation was a little flimsy considering you could grow breasts, but you suppose magic is like that sometimes. Your body is almost yours to control now anyway.\n\nAmber watches you carefully. \"You'll get there, though. Sooner than you think.\"\n\nAurora nods. \"For now, this is enough. You've already pushed your limits today.\"\n\nAmber watches you with a knowing smirk. Aurora watches you as well with her usual quiet intensity.

She's not like Aurora, who operates in riddles, or Milo, who wears his excitement on his sleeve. Amber is... something else.\n\n\"Do you mind if I go with you, Amber?\" you request.\n\nAmber's smirk deepens. \"Good choice, Prodigy.\" She turns on her heel, already walking. \"Come on. I know a spot.\"\n\nAmber doesn't wait for a response—she just starts walking, expecting you to follow. And you do.\n\nShe leads you through the woods with easy confidence, ducking under low-hanging branches and stepping over gnarled roots without breaking her stride. She's clearly been here before, moving like she knows every inch of the forest.\n\nYou glance back once, catching a glimpse of Aurora and Milo still standing in the clearing. Aurora watches you go with her usual unreadable expression, while Milo waves enthusiastically as if you're heading off on some kind of grand adventure.\n\nThe trees thin out as you keep walking, the dense canopy giving way to more open space. The air is different here—calmer and quieter like the world itself has exhaled. Then, suddenly, the forest breaks into a hidden overlook.\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\nA rocky outcrop juts out over a slow-moving creek, sunlight catching on the water's surface in scattered golden ripples. The bank is lined with smooth, flat stones, some big enough to even sit on. Tall grass and wildflowers grow along the edges, their colors vibrant. The whole place feels untouched, like something out of a dream.\n\nAmber walks up to the largest rock near the edge and drops down onto it, leaning back on her hands. \"This is it.\"\n\nYou take a few steps forward, taking it all in. It's peaceful in a way you didn't know you needed until now.\n\n\"This is your spot?\" you ask.\n\nAmber nods. \"One of them.\" She tilts her head back, eyes half-lidded. \"Sometimes you need somewhere quiet, y'know?\"\n\nYou do know.\n\nYou sit down next to her, stretching your legs out in front of you. Unlike Aurora, who always seems like she's waiting for you to ask the right questions, Amber is just here, existing in the same space without forcing anything.\n\nAfter a moment, she cracks an eye open and looks at you. \"So,\" she says, voice easy, \"what now? What do you wanna do with this little detour?\"\n\n[Choice: Skip stones on the creek]\n[Choice: Ask Amber why she brought you here]\n[Choice: Talk about something completely unrelated]",

      "text": "You glance at the creek, watching the way the light glints off the water's surface. Before you can even think about it, you're already moving. You push yourself up from the rock, stepping toward the bank where the stones are smooth and flat.\n\n Amber watches as you crouch and sift through them. \"Oh?\" she says, amused. \"You a stone-skipping kind of person?\"\n\n You roll a rock in your palm, feeling its weight. \"Guess we're about to find out.\"\n\n She smirks and swings her legs off the rock, joining you by the creek. \"Alright, let's see it, Prodigy.\"\n\n You square your stance, grip the stone between your fingers, and flick your wrist. It sails out over the water—plunk—and sinks instantly.\n\n \"Oof,\" Amber says, snorting. \"That was tragic.\"\n\n \"Shut up,\" you mutter, already reaching for another one.\n\n She crouches beside you, casually picking up a stone of her own. \"You know, there's a technique to it.\"\n\n \"I know that,\" you say, trying again. This time, the rock at least hops once before sinking.\n\n Amber smirks, weighing her own stone in her hand. \"Milo could probably explain it better than me—he overanalyzes everything—but it's all in the angle. You wanna flick your wrist low, get it as parallel to the surface as possible.\"\n\n She demonstrates, snapping her arm in a quick, fluid motion. The stone skips four times before finally sinking.\n\n \"Alright, that was pretty good,\" you admit.\n\n Amber grins. \"Obviously.\"\n\n You roll your eyes and try again. It takes a few more failed attempts, but eventually, you get the angle just right. The stone actually skips—not far, not impressive, but enough to feel like a win.\n\n Amber nods approvingly. \"There it is.\"\n\n You don't talk much—at least, not about anything important. Just little things. Complaints about school. The weird way time seems to pass faster when you don't want it to. Dumb jokes. It's the kind of conversation you don't have to think too hard about, and honestly? You needed that.\n\n At some point, Amber leans back on her hands and stretches. \"Welp,\" she says, pushing herself up. \"Hate to cut this short, [name], but I've got places to be.\"\n\n \n You glance around the clearing again, taking in the scenery. The air here feels different. Not magical, exactly—at least, not in the same way as the lessons with Aurora and Milo. But intentional. Like this place means something.\n\n You turn to Amber. \"Why here? Why bring me to this spot?\"\n\n Amber exhales slowly, stretching her arms above her head before letting them drop back onto the rock. \"Because you needed it.\"\n\n \"Needed what, exactly?\" you ask, frowning.\n\n \"A minute. A breath. A chance to sit in your own skin for a second without anyone telling you what it means.\" She tilts her head, watching you. \"You just went through something big. I figured maybe you should have a moment to be.\"\n\n You blink. It's... not the answer you expected. But as soon as she says it, you realize she's right.\n\n Since the moment you stepped into the woods, it's been constant. Learning. Training. Changing. Everyone has something to tell you, something for you to figure out. Your body has been shifting, your mind racing to catch up. You haven't had time to just... exist.\n\n Until now.\n\n Amber gives you a sideways glance. \"We don't really do that enough, y'know? Just sit with things. Everyone's always rushing to define everything, put it in a box, make a plan. But sometimes, the best thing you can do is shut up and feel it.\"\n\n You let her words settle. There's an easy confidence to her—not the kind that comes with knowing all the answers, but from being comfortable with not knowing. It's like she's figured out she doesn't need to have everything solved all the time.\n\n \"...You do this a lot?\" you ask.\n\n She shrugs. \"Used to. More than I do now. You won't always have the time to sit by a creek and think about life. So you take it when you can.\"\n\n You don't say anything to that, opting to just sit there and let the moment stretch. For the first time in days, you realize you're not thinking about what's coming next. Not thinking about your curse, your magic, or the changes happening to you.\n\n You're just here.\n\n Amber lets the silence linger before she finally pushes herself to her feet, brushing off her jeans. \"Alright, Prodigy,\" she says. \"As much as I'd love to keep imparting my infinite wisdom, I actually have places to be.\"\n\n \n You exhale slowly, letting the moment settle. The creek flows lazily below, the sun filters through the trees in soft golden streaks, and for once you're not thinking about magic, curses, or whatever the hell your life is turning into.\n\n You glance at Amber. \"So tell me—what's your stance on socks and sandals?\"\n\n Amber lets out a sharp laugh. \"Oh, absolutely a crime against fashion. I don't care if it's comfortable—if you wear socks with sandals, you have actively chosen violence.\"\n\n \"That's a strong opinion,\" you observe.\n\n \"Well, yeah, because it's correct,\" Amber says, waving a hand. \"You can't put socks on and then also wear open-toed shoes. Either commit to comfort or commit to the elements.\"\n\n You nod sagely. \"So you're saying it's a sign of weakness.\"\n\n \"Exactly.\" She gestures at you. \"See, I knew you had good instincts.\"\n\n You snort, leaning back on your hands. \"Alright, fine. Follow-up question—if you could have one completely useless superpower, what would it be?\"\n\n Amber hums, tapping her fingers against the rock. \"That's a good one. Let's see... I'd want the ability to always perfectly throw something into a trash can, no matter what.\"\n\n \"That is not useless,\" you say, raising an eyebrow. \"That's genuinely impressive.\"\n\n Amber shrugs. \"It just sucks when you miss and have to do the awkward walk of shame to pick it up.\"\n\n \"True,\" you admit. \"But imagine if you had to ability to instantly reheat food without making them soggy.\"\n\n Amber's eyes widen slightly before she nods. \"Okay. Now that is actually a world-changing ability.\"\n\n \"Big microwave doesn't want us to know the truth,\" you say, completely serious.\n\n Amber laughs, actually laughs, and it's this low, warm sound that makes the whole conversation feel surreal. Here you are, after everything that's happened, sitting by a creek talking about absolutely nothing. And for the first time in what feels like forever, you're just existing. No magic, no weight of the world, no expectations.\n\n You let out a slow breath, the tension in your body finally unknotting.\n\n \"Feels good, doesn't it?\" Amber asks, a knowing smirk tugging at her lips.\n\n You blink. \"What?\"\n\n \"Not thinking about shit,\" she says simply. \"It's nice to just talk.\"\n\n You hesitate, then nod. \"...Yeah. It does.\"\n\n Amber stretches with a satisfied sigh. \"Welp, I hate to ruin the vibe, but I got places to be.\"\n \n\n\"Oh yeah?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow. \"Got another forest to hang out in?\"\n\nShe chuckles. \"Something like that.\" Then, after a pause, she tilts her head slightly. \"You're good, by the way.\"\n\n\"What?\" You blink.\n\n\"All of this?\" she says, gesturing at you. \"You're handling it. You're gonna be just fine, [name].\"\n\nYou don't know why those words settle in your chest the way they do, but before you can think too hard about it, Amber gives you a lazy salute and starts walking away. She disappears into the trees like she was never there at all.\n\nAnd for the first time in a long time, you let yourself take a breath.\n\n[Choice: Go home]",

Just a quiet assessment, like she was already expecting this answer. \"Suit yourself.\"\n\nThen, without another word, she turns toward Milo. \"You should head home.\"\n\nMilo blinks. \"What?

It's obvious in the way he lingers, the way his usual boundless energy is just slightly dimmed.

Half an answer.\"\n\n \"Fine,\" Aurora mutters, clearly unimpressed. \"You've got talent. You've got potential. That's rare. I want to see where it goes.\"\n\n \"So what happens after this?\" you ask, shoving your hands in your pockets. \"I keep learning magic until what?

You're barely paying attention to where you're going, just following Aurora's pace and letting conversation fill the space between steps. You ask her little things—about magic, about Milo, about why she never just says things outright—and she responds in the same way she always does. Half-answers, vague truths, but never lies.\n\nIt's only when she stops in her tracks that you realize where you are.\n\nYour house.\n\nYou blink, looking up at it, then back at Aurora. \"Did you—?\"\n\n\"You were following me,\" she says simply.\n\nYou stare at her. \"You were leading.\"\n\n\"Yet here we are.\"\n\n\"That was so unnecessary,\" you sigh, shaking your head.\n\n\"Maybe,\" she says, already turning to leave.\n\nYou watch her walk away, disappearing down the street, her presence fading like she was never here at all.\n\n[Choice: Go home]",

You can make something.\n\n [Choice: Shape the energy into fire]\n [Choice: Shape the energy into light]\n [Choice: Shape the energy into something solid]\n\n \n The magic hums beneath your skin, coiled and waiting. You take a deep breath and focus, your fingers twitching slightly as the energy hums around you. The sensation is electric and warm, and you can tell it's waiting.\n\n If you can feel it this strongly, then maybe... maybe you can move it.\n\n You raise your hand, fingers slightly spread. The energy stirs, responding to your intention before you even know what you're doing. The warmth in your chest spreads down your arm, swirling in your palm like liquid light.\n\n Aurora stays silent, and even Milo is uncharacteristically still.\n\n You exhale—and push.\n\n The response is instant. The energy flows, rushing outward like a current released from a dam. It doesn't resist or fight—it moves, as naturally as exhaling.\n\n The leaves on the ground rustle, small twigs lifting slightly before settling back down. The air around your hand shimmers faintly, a ripple in reality itself.\n\n Milo lets out a laugh out of disbelief. \"Okay, that's not fair.\"\n\n Aurora's gaze sharpens. \"You didn't even hesitate.\"\n\n You flex your fingers, watching as the lingering strands of magic energy dissipate into the air. \"It just felt... natural.\"\n\n \"I mean, yeah, 'cause that makes sense, right?\" Milo throws his hands up. \"We just dropped a brand new practitioner into a lesson, and instead of flailing around like everyone does, they immediately bend reality like it's nothing. Yeah, that's no big deal.\"\n\n \"You sound upset,\" you say.\n\n \"Well, I am upset!\" he says dramatically. \"I had to practice for weeks before I could even see mana! You just woke up and decided to be some kind of wizard.\"\n\n Aurora, however, is watching you carefully. \"Do it again.\"\n\n You glance at your hands, feeling the magic still waiting inside you, knowing it'll respond once you call on it.\n\n The question is—how do you want to test it?\n\n [Choice: Focus on precision]\n [Choice: Focus on force]\n [Choice: Focus on interaction]\n\n \n The magic hums around you, crackling in the air, weightless yet undeniably real. But it's not enough to just let it flow. Not for you. You want to control it.\n\n Slowly, you take a breath and focus—not on pushing the energy outward, not on shaping it into something external, but on pulling it back.\n\n At first, nothing happens. The energy simply lingers, shifting and flickering in the air like mist under moonlight. It doesn't resist you, but it doesn't obey either. It's simply existing.\n\n You frown, narrowing your focus. The magic wants to move—it responded so easily before—so why not now? Then you realize you're thinking about it wrong. You're thinking like it's something separate, like something you have to take back. But it's not separate and it never has been. It's yours. It never left you—it's just waiting for direction.\n\n You breathe in, and this time, the magic moves.\n\n The air around you shifts as the light flickering at your fingertips pulls inward, sliding across your skin in rippling waves. A warm rush spreads through you, filling every inch of you like electricity.\n\n You hear Milo whisper, \"Woah.\"\n\n The sensation is overwhelming, but not in a bad way. It's just right. Like your body is recognizing something it always should have known. The magic doesn't vanish but rather settles.\n\n Aurora's voice cuts through the moment, calm but measured. \"You're absorbing it.\"\n\n You exhale, rolling your shoulders as the last of the energy sinks in. It doesn't hurt or strain. If anything, you feel more awake, more aware.\n\n You look down at your hands, no more glowing wisps of light. No visible traces of magic were left in the air. But you can feel it now—like something just beneath your skin, thrumming in your pulse.\n\n Aurora watches you closely, expression unreadable. \"How do you feel?\"\n\n You flex your fingers. \"Different.\"\n\n She nods. \"Good.\"\n\n Milo still looks somewhere between awed and mildly horrified. \"I can't decide if this is the coolest thing I've ever seen or the most terrifying.\"\n\n Magic hums beneath your skin, waiting for your next move.\n\n [Choice: Try absorbing more energy from the environment]\n [Choice: Try controlling where the magic settles]\n [Choice: Try releasing the magic in a controlled way]",

      "text": "You exhale slowly, fingers curling as you focus on the swirling energy around you. It moves, shifting and flickering, waiting for direction. You don't overthink it. You don't hesitate. Instead, you let instinct take over.\n\n Burn.\n\n The response is instant. The air around your fingertips ignites, and suddenly, there's fire—real fucking fire—dancing in your palm. It cackles softly, bright orange and gold jumping at you, flickering like it's testing its own existence. The heat kisses your skin, but it doesn't burn or hurt. It's yours, as natural as breathing.\n\n Milo lets out a strangled noise. \"[name], you did not just make fire on your first try—oh my God.\"\n\n Aurora's gaze sharpens. \"That's advanced magic.\"\n\n You barely hear them, too caught up in the feeling, in the way the flames listen to you. You turn your head slightly, and the fire follows, curling around your fingers in twisting ribbons before settling again. You know this should be difficult and that magic isn't supposed to come this easily. But the fire responds to you without effort, as if it was waiting all along.\n\n Aurora steps forward, watching carefully. \"Put it out.\"\n\n You don't question her. You take a slow breath and relax your hand. The fire obeys and flickers once before vanishing completely, the heat fading as if it was never there at all.\n\n Aurora's expression doesn't change, but something shifts in her posture. She's taking you a lot more seriously now.\n\n Milo just stares at your empty hand, still processing what just happened. Then, he grabs your shoulders and shakes you. \"YOU JUST—\" He gestures wildly. \"THAT WAS—DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU JUST DID?!\"\n\n You do. And something tells you this is only the beginning.\n \n \n You focus, steadying the energy in your palm. Fire feels too volatile, too wild. Something solid seems impossible though—at least for now. But light? Light is constant. Light is everywhere. It's something you know.\n\n The energy hums, flickering like a flame caught in the wind. You close your fingers slightly, guiding it and willing it to stabilize. At first, it resists, shifting between brightness and shadow, unable to decide what it wants to be. You push forward anyway, narrowing your focus, letting instinct take over. You don't force it but rather guide it. The moment you stop trying so hard and just let it happen, the glow steadies.\n\n A soft, golden light flares to life, hovering just above your palm. It's small at first. But as you breathe, it grows stronger and brighter, pulsing in time with your heartbeat. The clearing is still, bathed in the quiet glow of something that should be impossible. The light feels warm like sunlight filtering through the tree branches on a summer day. It doesn't even flicker anymore. It's just yours.\n\n Milo lets out an actual squeak, grabbing Aurora's sleeve and shaking it. \"Are you seeing this? He just did that.\"\n\n Aurora doesn't respond right away, instead studying the light. When she finally speaks, her voice is quieter than before. \"That wasn't supposed to be that easy.\"\n\n You don't know what to say to that. You just stare at the glow in your hand, watching the way it bends and shifts with your smallest movements, completely under your control. You realize that this isn't just magic.\n\n This is yours.\n \n \n You focus, pushing the magic further, tightening its form, willing it into something solid. The swirling light resists at first, flickering unsteadily, shifting unsteadily and shifting between shapes. It's like it can't quite decide what to be. But you don't let it slip away. You hold it, forcing it to take shape. The energy in your hands condenses, the glow solidifying.\n\n Weight.\n\n Your breath catches. You can feel it now, something pressing against your palm, something real. It's smooth and cool to the touch, but faintly pulsing with energy. You don't know what you were expecting—some kind of vague mass, maybe—but when you finally look down at what you've made, your stomach flips.\n\n It's a stone. Small, polished, dark as obsidian but threaded with veins of shimmering blue light. It hums with a quiet power as if tethered to the raw energy you pulled it from. You tighten your grip, half-expecting it to vanish the second you stop thinking about it. But it stays.\n\n Milo makes an excited noise. \"Are you kidding me?! First try and you make a thing?! An actual thing?!\" He rushes forward, nearly tripping over himself as he stares at the stone. \"That's insane!\"\n\n Aurora steps closer, her expression unreadable but sharp, like she's analyzing every detail of what just happened. She lifts a hand, slowly, carefully. \"May I?\"\n\n You hesitate, fingers tightening around the stone instinctively. Some part of you, for whatever reason, doesn't want to let go of it just yet. It's yours. You made it.\n\n Aurora notices your hesitation and doesn't push. Instead, she simply nods, her eyes flicking back to the stone. \"Do you feel that?\" she asks quietly.\n\n You swallow, suddenly aware of the way it pulses in your hand, the way it feels less like an object and more like a piece of something bigger. Like it's still connected to you.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you murmur. \"I feel it.\"\n \n\n \n \n You close your eyes for a brief second, steadying yourself. The energy is still there, waiting. Not impatient or chaotic—just present. You know, instinctively, that you can guide it.\n\n But power without control is useless.\n\n So this time, you focus. Instead of letting the magic just rush outward freely, you try to shape it and guide it with intention. Your eyes land on a single leaf resting on the forest floor, untouched among the scattered debris.\n\n That's your target.\n\n You exhale slowly, stretching your fingers out. The warmth surges in response, running down your arm to your palm, ready to be released. But instead of pushing it all at once, you only let a thread of it escape.\n\n A faint, nearly invisible shimmer stirs in the air, a ripple that moves with you as you carefully direct it. The leaf trembles, just slightly. You concentrate harder, dialing back the flow of energy and adjusting the way it moves.\n\n The leaf lifts.\n\n It barely hovers above the ground, only an inch at first, then two. The movement is nothing like the burst of energy from before. Smooth, controlled, and delicate. The magic isn't acting wildly; it's listening to you, responding exactly the way you want it to.\n\n Milo lets out a quiet gasp, doing his best to not break your focus. Even Aurora watches with a hint of something else—something bordering on impressed.\n\n You decide to test the movement further, shifting your fingers ever so slightly. The leaf tilts, turning in midair, rotating smoothly like it's caught in an unseen breeze. It doesn't falter or stutter. After all, you know how to do this.\n\n You let the energy slowly withdraw, guiding the leaf back down until it rests gently on the ground once more. The moment it touches the ground, the magic disperses, fading like mist under the morning sun.\n\n \"Holy crap,\" Milo breathes. \"That was—what—how—what?!\"\n\n Aurora doesn't say anything at first, just watching you like she's reassessing everything she thought she knew. Then, after a moment, she speaks.\n\n \"[name], you don't just have magic,\" she says. \"You understand it.\"\n\n You flex your fingers absentmindedly, still feeling the lingering warmth of the energy that had passed through them. You should be shocked, but you're really not.\n\n Because deep down, this doesn't feel like something new.\n\n It feels like something you were meant to do.\n \n \n If the magic inside you moves this easily, then what happens if you push harder?\n\n You steady yourself, planting your feet firmly on the forest floor. The magic hums beneath your skin, alive and waiting. You can already feel how effortlessly it flows, how it bends to your will. If you have this much control already, then it's time to see what happens when you really push it.\n\n You scan the clearing, searching for something more solid—something that won't just twitch under your influence but move. Your eyes eventually land on a thick, moss-covered log a few feet away. It's heavy and unmoving, the perfect test.\n\n You extend your hand toward it, fingers splayed, and take a deep breath.\n\n The magic stirs instantly, curling in your chest before rushing down your arm. It's warm but not uncomfortable, electric but not overwhelming. It wants to move, to follow, to be used. You grip onto that feeling, shaping it into something sharp and deliberate.\n\n Then, with one final breath, you release it.\n\n The effect is instant.\n\n The air around you tenses, like a silent pulse has just torn through it. A powerful force surges outward from your palm. The moss-covered log doesn't just shift—it lurches, skidding across the dirt. The impact sends leaves flying, a cloud of dust kicking up around it. The movement is effortless as if the weight of the log didn't even matter.\n\n Milo lets out a strangled, \"WHAT—\"\n\n Aurora doesn't move, but her eyes narrow.\n\n The magic fades from your fingertips and you take some deep breaths.\n\n Milo stumbles forward. \"Dude,\" he breathes. \"You—That—You just—\" He gestured wildly toward the log which is now sitting several feet from where it started. \"That's what you consider a first attempt?\"\n\n You flex your fingers, your pulse still steady. \"I thought it'd be harder, to be honest.\"\n\n Milo makes a wounded noise. \"It's supposed to be!\"\n\n Aurora, on the other hand, stays quiet. She steps toward the log, crouching slightly, running her fingers over the dirt where it scraped across the ground. Finally, she stands, turning to you with an unreadable expression. \"[name], you didn't just push it,\" she says carefully. \"You drove it. Like you weren't even considering the weight, the resistance. Like it was never a factor. That's rare.\"\n\n You glance at the log again. The energy still lingers inside you, strong and steady. And the truth is, you just don't know how to feel.\n \n \n You flex your fingers, feeling the hum of energy that's just waiting for direction. Sending magic outward was easy. But now, instead of pushing it, you want to try something else. Something deeper.\n\n You close your eyes for a moment, focusing not on force but on connection. If magic is like breathing, like moving a part of yourself, then maybe it's not just about sending it away. Maybe you can hold onto it. Shape it. Let it linger.\n\n You exhale, and the warmth in your chest stirs. This time, when you push the magic outward, you don't release it all at once—you let it unfurl like an invisible thread stretching from your fingertips into the space around you. It glows faintly, barely visible in the air, swirling like mist caught in a slow-moving current.\n\n You reach out—not physically, but with the part of yourself that feels this energy—and try to grasp it.\n\n The moment you do, the magic moves.\n\n Not away from you, not dissolving into the air, but staying. It hovers between your hands like something half-formed, waiting for definition. You adjust your focus and the energy shifts with you, curling at the edges. It curls at the edges like ink spreading in water, refusing to settle into a shape just yet. But it doesn't fade. it doesn't scatter.\n\n It's yours.\n\n Milo makes a choked sound beside you. \"Okay, no, see, this is ridiculous.\"\n\n You open your eyes, watching as the glowing strands drift lazily in the space between your hands. When you tilt your fingers, the light follows, twisting into spirals before settling again.\n\n \"[name], do you know how hard that is?!\" Milo asks, waving frantically at the display. \"Holding magic in place like that—it's not normal! It's supposed to be like holding water in your hands!\"\n\n You look back at the glowing strands of music, shifting slightly as you concentrate. You can feel it wanting to return to its natural state, but as long as you want it to stay, it does.\n\n Aurora exhales through her nose. \"Well,\" she murmurs. \"That confirms it.\"\n\n You glance at her. \"Confirms what?\"\n\n Aurora meets your gaze, her eyes sharp. \"You're not just talented,\" she says. \"You're something else entirely.\"\n\n The magic wavers slightly in your hands as her words sink in.\n\n You don't know what that means, but you're going to find out.\n \n\n \n \n The magic inside you still hums. It's not restless or fading—it's just here, waiting. You close your eyes and shift your focus outward. The magic you gathered before was yours, something you had called on without thinking, but what about what already exists around you? That means it should be everywhere, shouldn't it?\n\n Slowly, you reach.\n\n At first, you don't feel much. The clearing is quiet, the air remaining cool against your skin. But as you push your awareness beyond your own body, something flickers at the edge of your senses. The trees, ground, and even the air itself are alive.\n\n Not in a conscious way, but there's something there, something deeper than what your eyes can see. Energy laced through the dirt, the leaves, the dirt beneath your feet. It moves lazily, like the natural ebb and flow of the earth breathing. It's not being used or directed—it's just existing.\n\n You inhale, pulling gently, and the response is immediate.\n\n A rush floods through you, but it's colder than before. It's tinged with something raw, something untouched. It's slower than pulling in your own magic, but it works. You can feel the energy shifting, unraveling from where it was settled, drawn toward you. It seeps into your skin, curling into your veins, heavier than what you'd gathered before but still right. Still yours the moment you take it in.\n\n \"Are you serious right now?\" Milo asks, making a strangled noise.\n\n You open your eyes, and he's staring at you in disbelief. Even Aurora looks... interested.\n\n \"That shouldn't be possible,\" Milo continues, waving his hands wildly. \"Like, yeah, sure, technically anyone can theoretically pull from natural sources, but it's supposed to be hard as all hell! You can't just grab it!\"\n\n Aurora ignores him. \"Describe what you felt,\" she demands, eyes locked onto you.\n\n \"It was just there,\" you say slowly. \"Like it was waiting. It wasn't being used, so I just... called it.\"\n\n Milo lets out a high-pitched laugh. \"Oh, sure, that makes sense! Just called it! Just took wild, raw magic straight from the environment with zero effort, like a normal person does!\"\n\n You barely hear them, still adjusting to the energy swirling inside you. The magic from the environment settles differently than your own—it's heavier, slower to fade. You don't even feel drained, if anything, you feel more aware.\n \n Magic seems to come easy to you. Maybe too easy.\n \n \n You can feel the magic still there; in your fingertips, in the steady rhythm of your pulse, and in the space between each breath. It isn't chaotic, but it isn't structured either—it's waiting, for direction and purpose.\n\n You close your eyes and focus, not on pulling more in, not on expelling it outward, but on guiding it. Right now, it's everywhere, spread thin across your entire body. But what if you could concentrate it? Shift it from one place to another, focus it onto something more deliberate?\n\n You carefully try pulling it toward your hands. It doesn't move at first, lingering in place. You try again, and this time, the sensation shifts—the magic pulls toward your palms in a gradual current, pooling just beneath the skin. It tingles slightly, but it doesn't hurt at all. If anything, it feels right.\n\n The moment you recognize that feeling, the magic moves faster, like it's responding to your understanding. You shift your focus again, encouraged, pulling it away from your hands and into your legs. The warmth follows without resistance, settling into the muscles, making you feel lighter. Then, you redirect it once more, letting it spread through your chest. It settles deep in your core like a waiting fire.\n\n You open your eyes, heart steady, mind aware. You feel stronger, like there's an entire layer of potential inside you that wasn't there before.\n\n Milo is staring at you. \"[name], you did it.\"\n\n Aurora, standing slightly apart, doesn't look surprised. She just watches you with that same unreadable gaze, like she's already seen where this is going.\n\n You flex your fingers. This is control, and that changes everything.\n \n \n The energy thrums beneath your skin, not wild or unstable, but definitely there. It's a steady, waiting presence. It's different from before—like something within you, something yours. You want to see if you can control it. If you can direct it back out without it slipping away entirely.\n\n You take a slow breath and focus. You don't want to just let it go. That would be too easy. Releasing it carelessly would make it scatter, fade back into the environment. You need precision, pushing it back deliberately in the same way you pulled it in.\n\n At first, nothing happens. The magic continues to hum in your chest, steady and unmoving. You can feel it there, but it doesn't respond the way it did when you absorbed it. You frown and readjust, trying to grasp at something unseen. If drawing it in was like inhaling, then releasing it should be like exhaling, right?\n\n You focus on your palm, imagining the energy traveling there. The magic resists at first, clinging to you like it's a part of you now that doesn't want to leave. You push a little harder, mentally guiding it outward. Slowly, the air around your hand begins to shimmer. It's faint at first, but then—light. Soft tendrils of something golden and fluid hover just above your skin.\n\n Milo lets out a gasp. \"Oh, come on!\" He throws his hands in the air. \"This is so unfair.\"\n\n \"Now hold it,\" Aurora says.\n\n You grit your teeth as the magic flickers. It threatens to unravel, to move, to disperse, to return to whatever it came from. But you fight against that instinct, holding it together. It's like balancing water on your palm, trying to keep the shape without letting it slip through your fingers.\n\n The strain creeps in, and it really is work to keep this much energy in check. You feel it pressing outward, but as you breathe slowly, you adjust the way you push it outward. The shimmering light stabilizes, no longer flickering but hovering steadily.\n\n \"Are we sure he hasn't been doing magic in secret for years?\" Milo asks Aurora.\n\n Aurora finally exhales, crossing her arms. \"No. He's just that strong.\"\n\n You release the energy, letting it dissolve into the air. As the glow fades and the pressure in your body lightens, you glance down at your hands. The magic is gone now, but you can still feel it, waiting for you to call it again.\n\n You don't know what this means yet, but you're excited to learn more.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "You're on all fours now, your body tense with anticipation. The mattress beneath you is soft and yielding, supporting your weight as you shift slightly. Your back arches gently, your hips tilted up, exposing your most intimate area to the cool air of your bedroom.\n\n Your left arm is stretched behind you, your elbow bent at an angle, hovering just above your ass. Your hand is positioned carefully, palm facing inwards. Two of your fingers, slick with lotion, are poised mere inches from your tight, virgin hole.\n\n You shiver involuntarily. Your breathing is ragged, each inhale and exhale punctuated by the sound of your own arousal. Your breath hitches as you hold your fingers there, just close enough to feel the heat emanating from your body. The anticipation is palpable, an electric energy that courses through your veins. It makes every nerve ending in your body tingle. You're hyperaware of every sensation, every slight movement, every sound in the room.\n\n It's time.\n\n [Choice: Stick them in]\n\n \n \n You take a deep breath, your heart pounding in your chest, before finally pressing your lubricated fingers against your anus. There's a brief moment of resistance before you feel yourself give way, allowing the tip of your finger to slide in. You can't help the small gasp that escapes your lips as you feel the foreign sensation of penetration. It's strange and new, yet not entirely unpleasant. You take a second to adjust, to get used to the feeling, before slowly moving your fingers in deeper. You feel the muscles around your fingers clench and relax, accepting the intrusion.\n\n You delve further inside, recalling what you heard about the prostate, the bundle of nerves that promises intense pleasure. You angle your fingers and probe carefully, searching for the right spot. It takes a few moments, but then you feel it—a small, firm bump about two inches in. As soon as you make contact, a jolt of pleasure shoots through your body. You gasp again, louder this time. Your entire body tenses and your breath catches in your throat as waves of ecstasy wash over you.\n\n Your eyes roll back, your toes curl, and your body shudders as you press against the gland again, harder this time. The pleasure is intense and overwhelming, and you can't help but let out a moan.\n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n \n You lose yourself in the sensation, your fingers working furiously against your prostate. Your movements become erratic and desperate as each stroke sends a jolt of pleasure straight to your core. The initial discomfort is long gone, replaced by a white-hot pleasure that consumes your every thought, your every movement.\n\n The pleasure coils in your belly, growing tighter and hotter with each passing second. You're so close you can practically taste it, and you know that it's going to be intense. You lean forward, bracing yourself against the bed, your hips bucking back involuntarily as you push deeper and harder.\n\n Your vision starts to blur, the pleasure almost too much to bear—a sweet agony that threatens to consume your entire body. You can feel the orgasm building, the pressure mounting, your body straining towards release. Your moans become louder and more urgent, filling the quiet room. \n\n [Choice: FuckFuckFuck]\n\n \n When you finally approach the edge you tremble and begin to feel it coming. The orgasm hits you like a fucking freight train, a force so powerful and intense that it leaves you breathless. Your body convulses, your muscles clenching and unclenching as waves of pleasure wash over you. You have to bite your lip to make sure you don't moan too loudly, but a few escape as your body is wracked with ecstasy.\n\n Your fingers, still buried deep inside you, are coated in your own slickness, the walls of your rectum pulsing around them. You can feel your prostate throbbing, still sending waves of pleasure crashing over you. Your penis, hard and throbbing, releases its load. Your hot, sticky cum spurts onto the sheets beneath you.\n\n You close your eyes as the orgasm consumes you. It's like nothing you've ever experienced before, a full-body sensation that leaves you shaking and gasping for breath. You can feel it in every fiber of your being.\n\n You ride the waves of your orgasm until you're left trembling, spent, and utterly satisfied. You collapse onto the bed, your chest heaving, your heart pounding.\n\n You've never felt anything like this before, and you know you'll be craving it again soon.\n\n [Choice: Finish]",

Your breath comes in ragged gasps, and your heart races wildly in your chest. The room around you seems hazy like you're dreaming. Slowly, you regain control of your limbs, pulling your fingers free from your sensitive hole with a soft pop. You can feel the emptiness, the lingering warmth, and the sticky remnants of your arousal on your skin.\n\nWith a sigh, you push yourself up, taking in the sight before you. Your cum is splattered across your bed, evidence of your pleasure. You reach for a nearby towel, using it to gently wipe away the mess, trying not to smear it further. Once the bed is clean enough, you turn your attention to your body.\n\nYour movements are sluggish, your arms and legs heavy with satisfaction. You can't help but smile as you wipe away the last traces of cum from your tummy. You've discovered a new side of yourself, and it's one that you're eager to explore further.\n\nAs you slide off the bed and pad towards the bathroom, you glance at the mirror. You feel alive in a way you've never felt before. In the shower, you take your time cleaning your ass, the water cascading down your back as you tenderly wash away the last vestiges of your little adventure. \n\nWhen you're done, you step out of the shower and slip into your pajamas, ready to head to bed.\n\n[Choice: Time for bed]",

The idea of magic still feels unreal—like something you shouldn't be able to do—but deep down, you know you can.\n\nSo you choose something that feels right.\n\n\"What about stamina?\" you ask. \"How long I can actually hold magic before it burns out.\"\n\nMilo perks up immediately. \"Ooh, endurance? That's a bold choice.\"\n\nAurora studies you for a moment before nodding. \"Alright. But be careful. Magic isn't about brute force—it's about control. If you push too hard, you'll just burn yourself out.\"\n\nMilo waves a hand dismissively. \"Yeah, yeah, but that's half the fun.\" He gestures toward the clearing. \"Alright, step right up! Let's see what you've got, [name].\"\n\nYou move forward, standing in the open space between the trees. The air feels heavier here like the world itself is paying attention. Aurora watches silently, arms crossed, while Milo is vibrating with excitement.\n\n\"Okay,\" Milo begins. \"First, close your eyes.\"\n\nYou oblige.\n\n\"Now, you've really got to feel for it,\" he continues. \"Magic's all around you. Think of it like... heat from fire, or water running underground. Don't reach for it—just notice it.\"\n\nAt first, there's nothing. Then, slowly, something shifts. It's not sight or sound—it's awareness. A tingling in your fingertips, a hum just beneath your skin, like a forgotten muscle stretching for the first time.\n\n\"I think I've got it,\" you murmur.\n\n\"Alright, that was fast,\" Milo says. \"Okay, okay—next step. Instead of just noticing it, try holding onto it. Don't fight it though, just let it move through you.\"\n\nYou breathe in, steadying yourself, and focus. The hum grows louder, turning into a low vibration in your chest, spreading through your limbs. It's powerful, more than you expected, but it doesn't feel overwhelming. It just feels... natural.\n\nMilo lets out a small laugh. \"Okay, damn, you're actually doing it. How does it feel?\"\n\nYou open your eyes, and for the first time, you see a faint shimmer in the air around you.\n\nAurora watches you carefully. \"Good. Now hold it.\"\n\nTime stretches.\n\nMilo glances at her, then back at you. \"Okay, so, uh, most people don't hold this for more than a few seconds before getting tired.\"\n\nYou frown. \"I'm not that tired.\"\n\nAurora's eyes darken. \"Try letting go.\"\n\nYou do, and for a split second, the world shifts.\n\nThe energy doesn't just fade—it snaps. The trees rustle violently, the wind kicks up, and the ground thrums beneath your feet. It's not dangerous, but it feels like something big just recoiled from your touch.\n\nMilo stares at you, eyes bugging out of his head. \"Uh,\" he clears his throat. \"So. Fun fact. You're crazy powerful.\"\n\nYou exhale, heart still pounding. You're not sure what all this means, but one thing is clear, you're something bigger than you ever realized.\n\nMilo claps his hands together. \"Okay, so, uh... next question: what are we going to do with you?\"\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Let's see how much you already know.\"\n\nYou frown. \"What do you mean 'already know'? I don't know anything about rituals.\"\n\nAurora's gaze sweeps over you, studying you. \"Magic has patterns, [name]. Structures. Even people who've never practiced it before tend to recognize those patterns, feel them. If magic is affecting you, then you've probably already started understanding it on some level, whether you realize it or not.\"\n\nMilo grins and pulls something from his pocket. It's a... stick, worn and slightly curved, about the length of his forearm.\n\n\"Behold!\" he announces, holding it up dramatically. The stick is covered in carvings—small, intricate symbols etched into the surface. They weave around one another in a way that almost looks like they move if you stare too long.\n\nHe tosses it to you without warning and you catch it on instinct. The second your fingers close around the wood though, something hums beneath your skin.\n\nYou inhale sharply.\n\nIt's familiar. Not in a way you can explain though. It's more like a song you've never heard before but somehow know the words to. The symbols feel right, their shapes pulling at something deep inside you. Your fingers trace one near the center, and the moment you do, a word—no, an understanding—forms in your mind.\n\n\"Protection.\"\n\nAurora watches you closely. \"Go on.\"\n\nYou run your thumb along another marking, letting it settle, waiting for the feeling.\n\n\"Binding.\"\n\nAnd another.\n\n\"Veil.\"\n\nYou exhale, looking up. \"I think it's a concealment charm. No—more than that. It's protection, but it's also anchoring something. Holding something in.\"\n\nMilo whoops. \"Damn! That was fast!\"\n\nAurora's expression remains unreadable, but something flickers behind her eyes.\n\n\"That wasn't just fast,\" she murmurs. \"That was exact.\"\n\nYou look back at the stick and grip it a little tighter. The carvings glow faintly, just for a second, before fading. It's almost like they responded to you.\n\nSomething inside you stirs.\n\nMilo nudges Aurora with his elbow. \"Okay, Aurora, be honest. You knew he'd be this good, didn't you?\"\n\nAurora doesn't answer right away. Then:\n\n\"I suspected.\"\n\nYou look at her. \"What did you suspect?\"\n\nShe holds your gaze for just a moment before shaking her head no. \"Later. You're not ready for that yet.\"\n\nMilo groans. \"Oh, come on! Give him something! He just read that like it was the back of a cereal box or something!\"\n\nAurora ignores him, turning to you. \"So.

Okay, okay, let's see...\" He starts digging through his pockets, muttering to himself. \"Too boring... too complicated... ooh, definitely not that one...\"\n\n Aurora exhales. \"Milo.\"\n\n \"Yeah, yeah, I got it.\" He finally pulls something out and tosses it your way.\n\n You catch it and look down to see what it is. You see a small, round stone, barely bigger than a pebble, with deep grooves carved into its surface. The markings are different from the ones on the stick—more angular, sharper. You turn it over in your palm, letting the weight of it settle. The longer you hold it, the more something in your mind starts to shift, almost like a puzzle piece locking into place.\n\n A word surfaces. Sever.\n\n Then another. Distance.\n\n You frown, pressing your thumb into one of the deeper grooves. A faint pulse runs through your fingertips. It feels like the magic inside of it is pushing back.\n\n Forget.\n\n Your breath catches as you realize this isn't just an object with an enchantment. It's a tool. A spell woven into something solid.\n\n \"I think it's a separation charm,\" you say slowly. \"Or—no, it's more than that. It's meant to break connections and make things fade.\" You look up at them. \"This is for erasing things, isn't it?\"\n\n Aurora nods. \"You felt it.\"\n\n You nod back. \"Yeah.\"\n\n Milo scratches his head. \"Man, I knew you had potential, but this is kinda scary.\"\n\n Aurora holds out her hands, and you place the stone in her palm. She closes her fingers around it and nods, confirming something to herself.\n\n \"You're not just reading them, you're understanding them,\" she says. \"That's not normal.\"\n\n Milo grins. \"Which, just to be clear, is awesome!\"\n\n Your pulse is still beating a little fast. You're not sure if awesome is the word you'd use, but one thing is obvious—you're good at this. Really good.\n\n [Choice: Ask about the stone]\n [Choice: See if you can activate the stone]\n [Choice: Ask Aurora what she means by 'not normal.']\n\n \n You tighten your grip on the stick, letting its carved symbols press into your palm. \"No more dodging, Aurora. What did you mean by that? Saying you suspected something?\"\n\n Aurora doesn't react right away. Instead, she watches you, measuring, like she's deciding whether or not you're ready to hear what she already knows. The woods around you feel still, almost like they're waiting for her answer just as much as you are.\n\n Milo crosses his arms. \"Now I'm curious too.\"\n\n Aurora exhales, then gestures for you to hand back the stick. You do, and she tucks it away before finally looking at you properly.\n\n \"[name], you picked that up and read it instantly,\" she begins. \"It wasn't just a guess or vague impressions, no, you knew. Most people take years to develop that level of ritual awareness, even with training. And you've had none.\"\n\n \"So what are you saying?\" you ask.\n\n Aurora doesn't even blink. \"What I'm saying is that you have a lot more magic in you than you think.\"\n\n A shiver runs down your spine. Not out of fear, but rather because you know, deep down, that she's right.\n\n \"Is it because of the [referto]?\"\n\n Aurora shakes her head. \"No. The spell forced it awake, but it didn't give you anything you didn't already have.\"\n\n Milo lets out a whistle. \"So he's just naturally ridiculous at magic? That's insane! You're, like, one of those prodigies, huh?\"\n\n The word prodigy makes you feel uneasy. It's strange to think that this is something you've always had, just buried deep inside.\n\n \"This is why I called you out here,\" she says, watching the thoughts run through your head. \"You need to start understanding not only what you are but what you could be.\"\n\n Milo grins. \"And, you know, how not to explode yourself into a bunch of [name] chunks. That part's important too.\"\n\n Aurora folds her arms. \"I'll ask you this now, and I need you to really think about it. Do you want to learn? Because if you do, we don't do this halfway. No half measures. We go all in.\"\n\n You look at her, then at Milo, then finally at the woods around you. Despite how much this is to take in, it's not even a question.\n\n \"Yeah, I want to learn.\"\n\n \"Then we start today.\"\n\n Milo pumps a fist in the air. \"This is the best decision you'll ever make, [name], I promise.\"\n\n Aurora raises a hand, stopping Milo's enthusiasm in its tracks. \"But first, you choose how we move forward.\"\n\n [Choice: Ask more about the curse]\n [Choice: Try a more advanced ritual test]\n [Choice: Ask if magic runs in your family]\n\n \n \n You turn the stick over in your hands, the carved symbols rough beneath your fingertips. The knowledge is still there, humming at the edge of your mind. You understood what the enchantment was—but a new thought creeps in.\n\n What if you could change it?\n\n You glance at Aurora. \"If I can read this, can I... rewrite it?\"\n\n Aurora raises an eyebrow. \"That really depends. Do you understand it well enough to reshape it without breaking it?\"\n\n Milo's eyes widen with excitement. \"Ooh, I love where this is going.\"\n\n You focus, letting your fingers trace the carvings again. Protection. Binding. Veil. It's a solid piece of magic, tightly woven, but you can feel where the threads of it connect, how the symbols lock together to create the effect. If you were careful—if you knew what to tweak—you might be able to shift its purpose without unraveling it completely.\n\n \"If you're serious about this, you need to be deliberate,\" Aurora comments. \"Changing enchantments is harder than creating them from scratch. It's like trying to remodel a house while you're still inside it.\"\n\n Milo leans in. \"Yeah, but if anyone can do it, it's gonna be him.\"\n\n You don't respond, too focused to comment. The symbols feel like they want to move beneath your fingers like they're waiting for you to give them a new shape. You just have to decide how.\n\n [Choice: Strengthen the protection]\n [Choice: Weaken the binding]\n [Choice: Find out what the stick's purpose is]",

      "text": "You watch as Aurora tucks the stone into her palm, keeping it away from the world. But now that you've felt it, now that you know what's inside, you can't just let that sit.\n\n You take a step closer. \"Who made that?\"\n\n Aurora doesn't answer right away. She rolls the stone between her fingers, her gaze unreadable. It's not hesitation, but rather calculation. Like she's deciding how much to tell you.\n\n Milo, on the other hand, doesn't have the same filter. \"Oh, it's bad,\" he says immediately. \"Like, really bad. You were right—it severs connections. The kind that shouldn't be severed.\"\n\n \"Like what?\" you ask, your stomach tightening.\n\n Even Milo hesitates this time, which is enough to make you nervous.\n\n Aurora finally speaks. \"Memories.\"\n\n \"What?\"\n\n She holds the stone up between her fingers. \"This is a forgetting stone. It's a tool. It doesn't erase entire memories, but it can fray them, weaken them. It can make things—people, places, even truths—feel distant. Less important.\"\n\n A chill runs down your spine. \"And people actually use that?\"\n\n Aurora's expression suddenly hardens. \"Some do.\"\n\n You gulp, realizing now why it felt so... wrong. That magic wasn't neutral or energy waiting to be shaped, it had a purpose. And that purpose was to take things away.\n\n Milo rubs the back of his neck, glancing at Aurora. \"We, uh... we actually took that off someone. Not, like, off their person, but it was in their stuff.\" His voice drops slightly. \"They don't know it's gone.\"\n\n You stare at him. \"So someone around here is planning to use magic to mess with people's memories?\"\n\n Aurora doesn't answer right away. She turns the stone over in her palm once more, her gaze lingering on the carved symbols. Then, with a small, precise movement, she closes her fingers around it—and it's gone. Before you can comment on that though, Aurora begins speaking. \"Possibly. Or they were already using it.\"\n\n The weight of it settles in your chest, heavy and wrong. Someone—someone close—was carrying a tool meant to erase things. Not to protect. Not to learn. To take something away.\n\n And if you hadn't asked, they wouldn't have told you.\n\n You look at Aurora. \"What else aren't you telling me?\"\n\n She meets your gaze, completely calm. \"Enough to keep you safe.\"\n\n You're not sure if you should be comforted or terrified. Either way, one thing is clear—magic isn't just happening to you anymore. It's bigger than that. Bigger than you.\n\n And you've barely scratched the surface.\n \n \n \n You stare at the stone in Aurora's hand, something tugging at you—an urge, a need to do more than just understand it. You don't know why, but you get the feeling this isn't just about reading magic. You know you can do something with it.\n\n \"Let me try something,\" you say, reaching for the stone.\n\n Aurora's purple eyes flick to yours, sharp and assessing. She doesn't stop you, but she doesn't hand it over immediately either. \"Are you sure?\"\n\n \"Certain.\"\n\n She considers your request for a moment longer before placing the stone back in your palm. It feels heavier this time, warmer, like it knows you're about to use it.\n\n Milo shifts excitedly. \"Oh, this is gonna be so good.\"\n\n You close your fingers around the stone, feeling the grooves press against your skin. The words that surfaced before—sever, distance, forget—hover at the edge of your mind, waiting.\n\n Magic, according to Aurora, is about shaping something unseen.\n\n So you try.\n\n You don't really know how it's supposed to work, but instinct takes over. You focus, reaching for the magic inside the stone, pushing toward it like pressing against the surface of a still pound. After a few seconds, you feel it shift, responding to you. The markings on the stone grow colder against your palm like ice spreading under your skin.\n\n The world blurs for half a second before snapping back into focus.\n\n Milo blinks. His grin falters slightly like something just slipped out of his grasp. He shakes his head, rubbing his temple.\n\n \"Woah, that was weird,\" he mutters. \"I just got hit with, like, the worst brain fog ever. What were we—?\" He trails off, frowning. His gaze flicks to you, then at Aurora, then back again. \"Wait. Didn't you just—?\" He stops, blinking rapidly. \"What were we talking about?\"\n\n Your stomach tightens as you realize it worked.\n\n You glance at Aurora, but she's watching you with the same cool expression as before, completely unaffected. Of course. She must've shielded herself before you even tried.\n\n Milo shakes his head, snapping his fingers a few times like he's trying to jumpstart his memory. \"Ugh, this is so annoying. It's like... I know we were just talking about something important, but it's fuzzy. Why is it fuzzy?\"\n\n You swallow, the weight of what just happened settling over you. You barely even tried and it worked.\n\n You altered someone's memories.\n\n Milo groans. \"Ugh, whatever. Probably wasn't important anyway.\" He waves a hand, the frustration already leaving his face. \"Anyway! Did you do something cool? Did I miss it?\"\n\n Aurora finally speaks. \"Yes, you just did.\" She doesn't sound impressed though. If anything, there's something heavy in the way she says it. A quiet acknowledgment of the fact that this wasn't just some simple test.\n\n This was power.\n\n You flex your fingers, staring down at the stone before placing it back in Aurora's waiting hand. It's no longer cold or humming with magic. Just a simple stone, spent for now.\n\n Milo stretches. \"It's still nagging at me though,\" he complains. \"I swear we were just talking about something cool.\"\n\n Aurora looks at you. Not at the stone, not at Milo—at you. You're not fully sure what's going on behind those eyes, but you know from this moment forward, she's watching you a lot more closely.\n\n And for the first time, you wonder if you should be watching yourself more closely, too.\n \n \n You watch Aurora carefully. \"What do you mean, 'not normal'?\"\n\n Aurora closes her fingers around the stone again, rolling it once in her palm before slipping it into her pocket. It's deliberate, and you know she's deciding how much she wants to tell you.\n\n Milo, however, has no such hesitation. \"Hmm, I don't know—just the tiny fact that most people have to actually study magic before they can read enchantments like a book.\" He throws his hands up. \"Meanwhile, you're over here picking it up on instinct.\"\n\n You swallow, glancing down at your hands. Magic is new to you, and now that you think about it, you really shouldn't be able to recognize a concealment charm at a glance or feel what a spell is supposed to do just by holding it.\n\n Aurora watches your expression shift, then finally speaks. \"You're connected to magic in a way that takes most people years to reach, [name].\"\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n \"That's what I'm trying to figure out.\"\n\n That doesn't exactly make you feel any better. \"So you don't know?\"\n\n Aurora shakes her head. \"Not yet, no. But what I do know is that whatever's happening to you—it's not just because of the curse.\"\n\n \"What do you mean?\" you ask, tensing slightly.\n\n She looks at you like she's measuring her words. \"Magic doesn't create something from nothing. It shifts, it transforms, but it doesn't invent talent.\" She pauses. \"Madame Serena didn't give you this ability. She revealed something that was already there.\"\n\n The air feels heavier now, and you take some time to let the weight of that realization settle over you. You don't know what to do with it. You don't know what it means.\n\n Milo rocks on his heels. \"Sooo... congrats?\"\n\n You give him a look. \"Congrats?\"\n\n \"I mean, yeah?\" A goofy smile fills his face. \"This is huge. You're basically a magic prodigy.\"\n\n \"Don't inflate his ego, Milo,\" Aurora comments.\n\n Milo lets out a laugh. \"I'm just saying—it's kinda badass.\"\n\n \"That's enough for now,\" Aurora declares. \"We'll figure out the rest either.\"\n\n You nod, still absorbing everything, still trying to wrap your head around what just happened.\n \n\n \n \n You take a deep breath to ground yourself. \"Alright, before we do anything else, I need to know more about the curse.\"\n\n Aurora nods like she expected this. \"Go on.\"\n\n \"Madame Serena really didn't explain much,\" you begin. \"She just said some cryptic stuff and that if I don't break it by the end of the school year, it'll be permanent. I don't even know what that means. What happens if I don't stop it? Do I just—\" You hesitate, the words catching in your throat. \"Do I just stay like this forever?\"\n\n Milo rocks back and forth, expression unusually serious. \"If she said it'll be permanent, then yeah. Magic doesn't go back on its word.\"\n\n You swallow. You already knew this, but having it confirmed makes it feel even more real.\n\n Aurora shifts her stance. \"You have to figure out what the curse is really showing you. This is a spell connected to personal truth. That's a deep and powerful form of magic. And Madame Serena doesn't cast anything lightly.\"\n\n \"Yeah, curses like this are really tricky. If it was as simple as undoing the spell and having your problems be solved, it wouldn't be Serena-level magic.\"\n\n You press your fingers to your temples, head starting to throb. \"So what, I have to—what? Go on some kind of journey of self-discovery? Find the meaning of life? What does that even mean?\"\n\n \"It means you have to start seeing magic not just as something happening to you, but something connected to you,\" Aurora says calmly. \"Serena didn't just throw some magic at you—she set something in motion.\"\n\n Milo taps his chin. \"Honestly, the whole 'mirror will reveal your truth' thing kinda says it all. You've got to figure out what that means.\"\n\n You huff, frustrated by how complicated everything is. \"And what happens if I don't?\"\n\n Aurora doesn't flinch. \"Then by the time the school year ends, it won't be a curse anymore. It'll just be you.\"\n\n Silence settles between you.\n\n The wind rustles the leaves. The woods feel heavier now, like even they understand what's at stake.\n\n <<if [acceptance] > 19>> \n Your hands tighten into fists. You don't know if you're scared or just overwhelmed.\n \n \n Your hands tighten into fists. You didn't want this. You never asked for this. Why the hell did this have to affect you?\n \n\n \"You still have time, [name],\" Aurora says, patient but firm with her words. \"But not forever.\"\n\n Milo claps a hand on your shoulders. \"Hey, don't worry! You've got us now. We'll figure this out.\"\n\n You exhale, trying to steady yourself. You know now that you have to figure this out and you have to do it before it's too late.\n \n \n \n You take a deep breath, steadying yourself. \"Alright, then. Let's try something harder.\"\n\n Milo grins, pumping his fist. \"Oh, I like this attitude!\" He turns to Aurora. \"Can we make him do something big? Maybe summon a ghost? Open a rift? Test his limits?\"\n\n Aurora gives him a flat look. \"He's not summoning anything.\"\n\n Milo groans. \"Ugh, fine. What's the plan, then?\"\n\n Aurora walks a few steps away and kneels down. With one hand, she traces a shape into the dirt—a small, intricate symbol made up of interlocking lines and curved strokes. It feels oddly important, like every small movement matters. When she finishes, she steps back and gestures to it.\n\n \"Erase part of it,\" she says.\n\n You frown. \"That's it?\"\n\n \"Not physically,\" Aurora clarifies. \"With magic.\"\n\n Milo lets out a whistle. \"Ooh, that's actually a good one. It's, like, a recognition test and a control test.\"\n\n You stare at the symbol, the weight of the challenge settling in.\n\n \"This is a containment sigil,\" Aurora continues. \"It's stable, balanced. If you can read the pattern, you should just be able to see where the strength of it lies. Your job is to disrupt that—carefully. You don't want to just blast it apart, that wouldn't be good. You want to unravel it.\"\n\n You kneel down in front of the symbol, hands resting on your knees. At first, it's just random marks in the dirt. But the more you look at it, the more it starts to make sense. There's tension in the way the lines meet, an invisible weight pressing down on the shape, holding it together. You can feel it.\n\n Your fingers twitch.\n\n You exhale and focus, reaching toward the symbol. Not physically, not with your arm, but with something deeper.\n\n For a second, nothing happens.\n\n Then a line wavers.\n\n It's small, barely noticeable, but you feel it shift like a thread being tugged from fabric.\n\n \"He's already got it,\" Milo says, clearly impressed.\n\n Aurora says nothing, but you can tell she's watching you intensely.\n\n You push a little further, narrowing your focus to one particular point. It's a delicate intersection in the pattern, a place where everything connects. You don't force it apart, but rather ease it loose. \n\n The sigil shudders.\n\n One of the lines smudges, not by touch, but by intent. The containment sigil is no longer whole. The balance has been broken. And you did all this without even needing to lay a finger on it.\n\n Milo claps his hands together. \"That was awesome!\"\n\n Aurora tilts her head slightly, and you're unable to read her expression. When she finally looks at you though, there's something barely there—something like approval.\n\n \"You're picking this up fast,\" she says. \"Faster than I expected.\"\n \n You glance at the disrupted sigil, then back at her. \"So... what does that mean?\"\n\n Aurora doesn't answer right away. She instead sweeps her foot across the symbol, erasing it completely, before looking you dead in the eye.\n\n \"It means we're done with this for now.\"\n \n \n You think about what Aurora said—that magic was already inside you and that the curse didn't give you anything. Shouldn't that mean someone in your family had it too?\n\n You glance at her. \"If this was always part of me, does that mean magic runs in my family?\"\n\n Aurora studies for a second before shaking her head. \"Not necessarily.\"\n\n You frown. \"So it just... showed up?\"\n\n \"It happens,\" Aurora says, nodding. \"Magic doesn't always follow bloodlines. Sometimes it skips generations, sometimes it jumps between distant relatives, and sometimes it just chooses someone.\"\n\n \"Chooses me?\"\n\n Aurora shrugs. \"No one knows why. But some people—very few—just are magic. It manifests in them naturally. No family history, no training, no nothing. Just pure potential.\"\n\n Milo, completely oblivious to the tension, waves a hand. \"Eh, I wouldn't worry about it, maybe it skipped a bunch of generations. Or maybe you had some long-lost magical great-great-whatever who was Merlin or Gandalf or something and now it's finally kicking in.\"\n\n Aurora gestures toward the clearing. \"This is a question for later though. Right now, we focus on what's in front of us.\"\n\n You stare at her for a moment before nodding. Sure, you can let it go for now, but the question lingers, settling deep in your chest. If your magic didn't come from your family... then where did it come from?\n \n\n \n \n Your fingers rest on the symbol for protection.\n\n It feels solid—the backbone of the enchantment. Whatever this charm was meant to do, this was the part of keeping it safe. The part holding it together and making sure nothing could break through.\n\n And you're about to make it even stronger.\n\n You take a deep breath and focus. The magic woven into the wood isn't resisting you, but it isn't exactly welcoming you either. It's stable, locked into place, doing exactly what it was designed to do. But there are gaps—tiny ones you can feel. \n\n You press your thumb against the symbol and push, imagining those weak points filling in, those defenses tightening, the whole structure reinforcing itself.\n\n The air around you shifts.\n\n The carvings on the stick grow warmer under your touch as they pulse. The edges of the protective sigil seem to sharpen like they've become more defined and purposeful. The energy in the wood hums, stronger now, like it's been giving fresh strength. The stick grows warmer and warmer, then—\n\n Snap.\n\n A sudden ripple moves outward from your hands, like an invisible wave bursting from the charm. It spreads in a flash, distorting the air around you before vanishing just as quickly as it appeared.\n\n Milo stumbles back. \"Woah! What was that?\"\n\n Aurora doesn't move, her eyes fixed on the stick. \"The magic just locked in.\"\n\n You turn the stick over, frowning. It feels denser somehow, heavier in a way that has nothing to do with weight. More anchored. Whatever was once contained in this charm is now definitely sealed.\n\n Milo edges closer, peering at the carvings. \"So... did you just supercharge it?\"\n\n Aurora tilts her head. \"More like reinforced the structure. It won't be easy to break now.\"\n\n You exhale, letting the magic settle in your hands. \"Good.\"\n\n You stand there, and you're glad whatever the charm was keeping in isn't going anywhere.\n \n \n Your fingers hover over the symbol for binding. Something about it feels heavy, like an iron clasp locked in place. its the foundation of the entire enchantment—the part that holds something in. You're unsure of what's being held in, but you can feel its tension.\n\n It's meant to keep whatever's inside from getting out.\n\n You tighten your grip on the stick. If you weaken this, if you loosen the binding just a bit, then whatever was being held back will have just a little more room to move. Maybe even escape.\n\n You press your thumb against the carved symbol, doing your best to concentrate. The lines feel like they resist you, like they know what you're trying to do and don't want to budge an inch. But you keep pushing, adjusting the pattern in your mind, shifting the edges, unraveling just enough of the magic's grip to test what happens.\n\n The resistance gives away.\n\n The stick creaks in your hands as if the wood itself is reacting. A dull vibration hums through your fingertips. The air around you thickens like pressure being released from something that had been locked too tight for too long.\n\n Milo instinctively takes a step back. \"Uhh, is it supposed to do that?\"\n\n Aurora's eyes narrow. \"No.\"\n\n The ground beneath your feet feels different—not shaking, not unstable, but definitely awake. Like something just shifted deep beneath the earth, something subtle but important. The wind moves through the trees in an odd way. It feels like it's curling back on itself instead of flowing freely.\n\n Then, suddenly, the weight vanishes. The vibration stops. The stick in your hands is still again.\n\n It should be over, but you know something has changed.\n\n Aurora watches you carefully. \"Do you feel that?\"\n\n You nod. \"Yeah.\"\n\n Milo glances between you two. \"Okay, well, I don't feel it. So can someone please explain if we just—y'know—unleashed something?\"\n\n Aurora doesn't answer, instead turning to look out past the trees.\n\n \"We'll find out sooner than later,\" she murmurs.\n\n You don't know what you just let out, but you do know whatever it is, it's not staying hidden anymore.\n \n \n Your fingers hover over the symbol for the veil. The one meant to hide.\n\n You don't know why, but something tells you that this symbol is the key. It's the part of the enchantment that keeps things obscured, that wraps the magic in secrecy. If you change it—if you weaken it—then whatever this charm was concealing will come to light.\n\n The thought sends a shiver down your spine, but you press your thumb against the symbol anyway. You focus on the shape of it and the way it connects to the others. You imagine unraveling it, loosening its hold just enough to let something slip through.\n\n At first, nothing happens. Then, slowly, the carving beneath your touch begins to warm. The lines of the symbol almost seem to blur, like ink bleeding on paper, shifting, bending at the edges. The rest of the stick trembles faintly in your grip like something inside it is reacting.\n\n \"Oh, that is so cool,\" Milo says, letting out a low whistle.\n\n Aurora, however, steps closer. Her voice is calm, sure, but there's something sharp beneath it. \"[name]. Be careful.\"\n\n The stick pulses, just once, like a heartbeat. And then a thin, wispy strand of light begins to curl off the wood like smoke rising from a candle. It drifts upward, shimmering, twisting into something almost recognizable before—\n\n Snap.\n\n The light disperses. The warmth fades. The stick falls still in your hands.\n \n You exhale, shoulders tense.\n\n Milo leans forward, his eyes bugging out of his head. \"Did you see that? That was—what the hell was that?\"\n\n Aurora doesn't answer immediately, still watching the air where the light had been.\n\n You swallow, glancing down at the stick again. The veil is still there, but it's weaker now. It was hiding something—something you almost saw.\n\n Aurora finally speaks. \"That was close.\"\n\n \"Close to what?\" Milo presses.\n\n \"To whatever was meant to stay hidden.\"\n\n A strange chill runs through you. You don't know what you just did, but you get the feeling you weren't supposed to.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

'push intent'?\"\n\nMilo shrugs. \"I don't know, you just do.\"\n\nYou glance at Aurora, half-expecting her to offer a more structured explanation, but she just watches, waiting.\n\nYou take a slow breath and reach out anyway, pressing your fingertips into the dirt, tracing over the symbol.\n\nThe second you do, the air shifts.\n\nThe sigil glows, faint at first, then bright. A deep, electric violet pulses outward from the symbol, the spiral thrumming with a life of its own.

Just the soft hum of the wind against the glass, the occasional chirp of a bird, and the distant sound of life carrying on without urgency.\n\nYou roll onto your back and stare at the ceiling. Yesterday still lingers in your mind—the way magic pulsed through your fingertips in the woods, the weight of knowing that something inside you is shifting. It's a lot, to say the least.\n\nShaking your head, you check your phone to see there are three messages, each from a different person.\n\nYou check Luke's message first.\n\n\"Yo, wake up. You're not allowed to be a hermit today.\"\n\nSmirking, you scroll to the next one sent by Vincent.\n\n\"Good morning, friend! Um, if you're free, I'm at the library right now. No pressure, of course! Just thought I'd ask.\"\n\nThen you see the third message.\n\n\"Need a favor. Meet me at the theater if you're free.\"\n\nYou blink.\n\nWait. Since when did you even have Jordan added on social media?\n\nYou scroll up, realizing there's barely any history between you—maybe one or two messages from forever ago. Jordan barely talks to anyone, let alone you.\n\nLuke's text is nothing surprising. He's always like this—pushing you to get out of the house, dragging you into whatever dumb idea he has for the day. If you go with him, it'll be effortless. No expectations, no pressure. Just a break from overthinking.\n\nVincent's message is polite, almost hesitant. It's like he half-expects you to say no. He's never the type to push, opting to just quietly invite you into his world. A slow afternoon of browsing books with him wouldn't be a bad way to clear your head.\n\nBut Jordan?

That's new.\n\nYou stand outside the entrance, staring at the old marquee with peeling letters advertising an upcoming play you've never even heard of.

The hum of distant voices filters through the empty space, and when you step into the auditorium, you spot Jordan immediately—standing alone on the stage, bathed in the soft glow of the overhead lights.\n\nHe doesn't notice you at first. His posture is looser than usual, more relaxed than the stiff, controlled way he carries himself at school. He's staring out into the empty seats, murmuring lines under his breath, his lips forming words you can't quite hear.\n\nFor a moment, you hesitate. This isn't the Jordan you're used to. This isn't the cool, untouchable athlete everyone sees at school.\n\nThis is something else entirely.\n\nThen he spots you. His whole body tenses for half a second before he lets out a sharp breath, shaking off whatever thoughts had been lingering in his head. \"You actually came,\" he says, stepping to the edge of the stage. \"Figured you'd ignore my text.\"\n\nYou cross your arms. \"Figured you wouldn't even have my contact.\"\n\nJordan huffs out something that isn't quite a laugh. \"Yeah, well. I needed someone.\" He jumps down from the stage, landing effortlessly before walking past you toward the side door that leads backstage. With no other choice, you follow.\n\nBackstage is cluttered—racks of old costumes, shelves stacked with dusty props, and the faint sound of a recording playing from one of the dressing rooms. Jordan moves through it like he belongs here, like it's second nature. When he stops near a worn-out couch shoved against the wall, he turns to face you, arms crossed.\n\n\"I need you to run lines with me.\"\n\nYou blink. \"That's it?\"\n\nJordan exhales sharply like he already regrets asking. \"Yeah. That's it.\"\n\n\"And I'm the first person you thought of?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n<<if [jordanRelo] > 9>> \n Jordan holds your gaze for a second too long before looking away. \"You're in theater. You know what you're doing.\" His voice is steady, but there's something unspoken beneath it, something he's not quite saying. \"Besides, I figured you wouldn't make this annoying.\"\n\n \n Jordan holds your gaze for a second too long before looking away. \"You're in theater. You know what you're doing.\" His tone is flat like he's keeping this strictly business. \"Besides, I didn't feel like dealing with anyone else.\"\n \n\nJordan doesn't ask people for things. He doesn't go out of his way to talk to anyone unless he has to. But he's here right now, backstage with you, waiting for an answer.\n\n\"Okay,\" you say slowly. \"So we just—run lines? No catch?\"\n\n\"No catch,\" Jordan replies, but there's a tightness in his jaw, like he's holding something back. \"I just need to be ready.\"\n\n\"Ready for what?\"\n\nJordan's expression doesn't change. \"Does it matter?\"\n\nYou hesitate, watching him carefully.\n\nJordan's always been distant with you like he's keeping you at arm's length no matter how often you cross paths. But now, for the first time, he's letting you in—just a little. Not enough to see everything, but enough to know there's something more going on.\n\n\"So?\" he asks, the edge creeping back into his voice like he's already bracing for you to say no. \"Are you gonna help or not?\"\n\n[Choice: Yeah, I'll help]\n[Choice: Not until you tell me what this is really about]\n[Choice: Can't you ask someone else?]",

No hesitation.\n\n Jordan watches you for a second before nodding, just once. \"Good. Then let's get started.\"\n\n [Choice: Begin]\n\n \n <<if [jordanRelo] > 9>> \n You cross your arms, not moving from where you stand. \"Not until you tell me what this is really about.\"\n\n Jordan exhales sharply through his nose, tilting his head back like he's already regretting asking you. \"It's just lines, [name]. Don't make it complicated.\"\n\n \"You made it complicated the second you asked me,\" you counter. \"You don't ask for help. Ever. And now, suddenly, I'm the guy you need?\"\n\n Jordan presses his lips together, his jaw working like he's debating whether or not to just shut you out. But then, after a beat, he sighs.\n\n \"It's for something outside of school,\" he admits, voice quieter. \"An audition. I need to be better than I am. That's it.\"\n\n You watch him carefully. Jordan's always careful with his words, like he's measuring out exactly how much he wants people to know. But something about the way he says it—like it's just an audition, like it doesn't matter that much—feels off.\n\n \"Why not ask someone from theater?\" you push. \"Anthony, Sharon, even Mr. Bennet would—\"\n\n \"No,\" Jordan interrupts, sharp but not angry. \"I don't want them to know.\"\n\n There it is. The real reason.\n\n You don't know all the details, but you know enough to get the picture. Jordan doesn't just want to get better—he wants to hide that he's even trying. You're not sure why, but you can tell he's not ready to tell you yet. But this is probably the most honest he's ever been with you.\n\n He shifts uncomfortably under your gaze. \"So, are you gonna help or not?\"\n\n You hesitate for just a moment before nodding. \"Yeah, I'll help.\"\n\n Jordan exhales, some of the tension leaving his shoulders. \"Good. Then let's get started.\"\n\n [Choice: Begin]\n \n \n \n You cross your arms, standing your ground. \"I can help, but not until you tell me what this is really about.'\n\n Jordan's expression darkens, and just like that, the walls go up. \"Forget it,\" he mutters, shaking his head. \"This was a mistake.\"\n\n You blink. \"Wait—\"\n\n But he's already turning away, grabbing his bag from the couch. \"I don't know why I thought you'd just go along with it.\" H is voice is cold and detached—the same tone he uses with people he doesn't care to deal with. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\n \"Jordan—\"\n\n \"See you at school, [name].\"\n\n And just like that, he walks past you, pushing open the backstage door and disappearing into the dim afternoon light.\n\n You stand there for a moment, watching the door swing shut, an uneasy feeling settling in your chest. You don't know what just happened, but one thing is clear—Jordan doesn't let people in, and whatever this was, you just got shut out.\n\n Looks like you won't be running lines today.\n \n [Choice: Go back home]\n \n\n \n \n You cross your arms, leaning back slightly. \"Can't you ask someone else?\"\n\n Jordan's expression doesn't change at first—still unreadable, still perfectly composed. But then his jaw tightens, just a little, and his fingers curl slightly at his sides. It's subtle, but for someone who rarely shows anything, it might as well be a full reaction.\n\n He exhales sharply through his nose and looks away. \"Forget it,\" he mutters.\n\n Before you can say anything else, he turns on his heel and starts walking back toward the stage. The conversation is over.\n\n For a second, you consider stopping him—asking what this was really about, why he even bothered texting you in the first place—but something about the way he carries himself makes it clear: he's done.\n\n You linger a moment in the quiet backstage, surrounded by old costumes and set pieces that feel a little too much like unfinished stories. Then, with nothing left to say, you turn and leave.\n\n Jordan doesn't try to stop you.\n\n [Choice: Go back home]",

      "text": "Jordan doesn't waste any time. The moment you agree, he turns and grabs a crumpled script from a nearby table, flipping through the pages with practiced ease. He doesn't say thanks, but then again, you weren't expecting him to.\n\nHe tosses the script toward you, and you barely manage to catch it before it smacks you in the chest. You recognize the title immediately—The Glass Menagerie.\n\n\"Really?\" you say, raising an eyebrow. \"You're going full Tennessee Williams for this?\"\n\nJordan shrugs like it's not a big deal. \"It's what they're using for the audition monologues.\"\n\nYou frown slightly. \"You didn't mention what this audition is for.\"\n\nHe doesn't look up from the script. \"You didn't ask.\"\n\nYou basically did ask, but you let it go.\n\nJordan flips to a page and hands you the script. \"Scene six. You'll read Laura.\"\n\nYou blink. \"You're playing Tom?\"\n\nJordan gives you a flat look. \"Obviously.\"\n\nIt's not a bad choice. The character fits him—Tom, the disillusioned dreamer, stuck in a life he doesn't want, quietly desperate for something more. You wonder if Jordan sees himself in the role or if he just picked it because it sounded good.\n\nStill, you can't help but smirk. \"Mr. Bennet would love this. He's been trying to get someone to take this play seriously all year.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, Mr. Bennet also tried to cast me as a talking tree once, so I think we have different ideas of what I should be taking seriously.\"\n\nYou snort. That checks out.\n\nJordan gestures toward the script. \"You good?\"\n\nYou glance down at the page, scanning Laura's lines. It's the scene where she and Tom sit together, where Tom—tired of his suffocating home life—talks about the movies and his longing for escape. It's a quiet, heavy moment, the kind that only works if the actors let it breathe.\n\nYou look back at Jordan. His expression is unreadable, but there's a sharp focus in his eyes, like this actually matters to him. Like it's real.\n\n\"Yeah,\" you say finally. \"I'm good.\"\n\nHe nods, takes a breath, and starts.\n\n\"Yes, movies! Look at them—all of those glamorous people—having adventures—hogging it all, gobbling the whole thing up! You know what happens? People go to the movies instead of moving!\"\n\nHis voice is steady and controlled, but there's something underneath it—something raw. He's good. Really good.\n\nYou read your first line, falling into rhythm with him. The words come easily, the tension in the scene settling between you. For a moment, the rest of the world fades away. It's just you, Jordan, and the story unfolding between you.\n\nThen Jordan delivers Tom's next monologue, the one about escape, about feeling trapped. And something in his voice shifts. It's not just acting anymore.\n\n\"I'm like my father. The bastard son of a bastard! Did you notice how he's grinning in his picture in there? And he's been absent going on sixteen years!\"\n\nThere's no hesitation, no self-consciousness in his delivery. It's the most open you've ever seen him—like for once, he's not holding himself back. Like he's actually feeling something.\n\nYou're about to say your next line when he abruptly stops. His jaw tightens. He shakes his head slightly and mutters, \"Damn it.\"\n\nYou lower your script. \"That was good.\"\n\n\"It wasn't good enough,\" he says immediately. He runs a hand through his hair, looking frustrated. \"Something's off. It's not landing right.\"\n\nYou hesitate, watching him. This isn't just practice for him. He cares about this. More than you realized.\n\nAnd for the first time, you start to wonder how much this audition really means to him.\n\n[Choice: You're overthinking it, that was great]\n[Choice: You're holding back, you need to let go more.]",

You just delivered that like a professional. If I didn't know you, I'd think you actually had a deadbeat dad and a burning need to escape small-town life.\"\n\n Jordan doesn't respond right away. His jaw is still tight, his arms crossed, but he isn't looking at you—he's staring off toward the darkened stage, almost as if he's running the scene in his head over and over again, searching for something that isn't there.\n\n \"You're overthinking it,\" you say again, more firmly this time. \"Mr. Bennet was right. You're good, Jordan. Like, stupidly good. And I'm not just saying that because I don't want to be here all night.\"\n\n That gets a small scoff out of him, barely audible but there.\n\n \"You're hitting every beat perfectly. Every line. Every pause. Every shift in emotion,\" you continue. \"You've got control. You get the character. So what's the problem?\"\n\n Jordan presses his lips together like he doesn't want to say it. But then, after a long pause, he mutters. \"It's too controlled.\"\n\n You frown. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n His fingers flex at his sides before he exhales, like he's admitting something he doesn't want to. \"Bennet said I need to stop holding back. That I keep everything too contained, like I'm afraid to let go.\"\n\n Jordan had taken Mr. Bennet's critique in stride a few days ago, nodding like it didn't bother him. But now? You're starting to think it did.\n\n \"You want the part, don't you?\" you ask. \"For Romeo or Mercutio.\"\n\n Jordan finally looks at you. \"Yeah.\"\n\n There's something in his voice—something quieter than usual. He's not saying it with arrogance, not saying it like it's expected. He's saying it like it's real. Like it actually means something to him.\n\n You think about the times you've seen Jordan on stage in class. How effortless it looks, how he fits into any role thrown at him like he was built for it. But now, you're realizing that's not effortless at all. He's thinking about it. Overanalyzing every little move and shift in tone.\n\n \"Okay, so maybe Mr. Bennet has a point,\" you say. \"But you can't force that. You're already good—you just have to trust yourself more.\"\n\n Jordan scoffs and shakes his head. \"That's not how it works, [name].\"\n\n \"It is how it works,\" you argue. \"You're holding yourself back, but not because you can't let go. You're doing it because you're scared to.\"\n\n The words tumble out of your mouth before you can think too hard about them, and Jordan's head snaps toward you, eyes narrowing slightly.\n\n \"Scared?\" he repeats.\n\n \"I said what I scared,\" you say, holding your ground.\n\n For a second, you think he's going to snap, tell you that you don't know what the hell you're talking about. But instead, he just looks at you like he's trying to figure out how serious you are.\n\n Then, finally, he exhales, dragging a hand through his hair. \"...Maybe.\"\n\n It's barely audible, but it's there. And coming from Jordan? That's basically a full confession.\n\n You can't help but smirk. \"You know, it's pretty funny that you chose a monologue about a guy desperate to get out of his own life.\"\n\n \"Shut up,\" Jordan says, glaring at you.\n\n \"Am I wrong?\"\n\n \"Shut up.\"\n\n You laugh and toss the script back at him. \"Come on, Jordan. Let's do it again. And this time? Stop thinking so much.\"\n\n Jordan rolls his eyes, but there's a shift in his posture—something a little less tense and a little more open.\n\n When he starts his monologue again, there's a difference in his voice. It's small, barely noticeable. But it's there.\n\n \n \n Jordan exhales sharply, shaking his head as he stares down at the script. His grip tightens around the edges of the pages, like he's trying to squeeze something out of them that just isn't coming.\n\n \"Jordan, you're holding back,\" you say, watching him carefully.. \"You need to let go more.\"\n\n Jordan's gaze flicks up to you, sharp and defensive. \"I am letting go.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"No, you're only acting like you're letting go.\" You nod toward the script in his hands. \"That last part about skipping out like his dad? It's supposed to feel messy. You said all the right words, sure, but you kept it controlled. You held it back.\"\n\n Jordan's jaw tightens. He looks like he wants to argue, but then his shoulders drop slightly.\n\n \"Mr. Bennet says the same thing to me.\"\n\n \"Yeah?\" you ask.\n\n Jordan shifts uncomfortably, like he's already regretting bringing it up. \"He pulled me aside once. Said I was good—better than I was at the start of the year—but that I wasn't there yet. Said I had all this emotion sitting just under the surface, but I won't let it out.\"\n\n He scoffs and looks away. \"Whatever that means.\"\n\n You think about Mr. Bennet's class, about how the first play of the year is Romeo and Juliet. About how Jordan—who never seems to care about anything—has actually been trying in theater.\n\n \"You're going for Romeo, aren't you?\" you say, putting the puzzle pieces together.\n\n Jordan is quiet for a beat too long before his expression hardens slightly. \"Or Mercutio,\" he says. \"I don't care which.\"\n\n Jordan really isn't the type to put effort into something unless it matters. And right now, you're realizing just how much this does matter to him.\n\n \"Mr. Bennet was right,\" you finally say. \"You've got all this energy, all this pressure behind your words, but you're still keeping control of it. That works in football, but not here.\"\n\n Jordan shoots you a look. \"And you don't think I know that?\"\n\n \"Prove it then,\" you say, leaning forward. \"You're Tom. You're pissed off. You're trapped. You want to leave, but you can't. You're not thinking about how you sound or how you look—you're just feeling it.\"\n\n Jordan stares at you for a long moment, his fingers tightening around the script. Then, without another word, he turns back toward the stage.\n\n You step back as he exhales, rolling his shoulders before shutting his eyes. When he opens them, something has changed.\n\n \"I'm like my father. The bastard son of a bastard!\"\n\n The words hit the air heavier than before. It's raw. Less polished, less careful.\n\n \"Did you notice how he's grinning in his picture in there? And he's been absent going on sixteen years!\"\n\n His voice doesn't crack, but there's something sharp at the edges of it. The frustration isn't just acting anymore—it's real.\n\n He doesn't stop this time, continuing to push forward. His tone rises and falls, filled with something desperate. You can hear it in his voice, in the way his fists clench at his sides. He's letting go, just a little.\n\n And when he finishes, the silence that follows is thick.\n\n You don't say anything at first, just staring. For the first time since you met him, Jordan isn't just playing the part.\n\n He is the part.\n\n Jordan exhales, dragging a hand through his hair. \"Better?\" he asks, trying to sound unaffected.\n\n You nod. \"Way better.\"\n \n\n[Choice: Continue practicing]",

      "text": "By the time you and Jordan finish running the scene for what must be the tenth time, the stage lights have dimmed to a dull glow. The theater is silent except for the rustling of scripts and faint creaks of wood settling. The outside world feels distant, like you've both been cut off from time itself, existing only in the small pocket of space between the stage and the empty seats.\n\nAfter a while, Jordan exhales, running a hand through his hair as he tosses the script on the couch beside him. \"That's enough for today,\" he mutters, voice low and tired.\n\nYou nod, stretching your arms out as you lean back against the side of the worn-out prop table. \"Yeah, that last run was solid. You're starting to let it hit.\"\n\nJordan doesn't respond immediately. He instead opts to pace a little, as if trying to work off the residual energy of the scene. Finally, he sits down on the couch, his usual rigid posture gone. His arms rest on his knees, his fingers loosely clasped together as he stares at the ground, lost in thought.\n\nYou don't say anything. You just wait.\n\nThe air between you is comfortable in a strange sort of way—like the tension from earlier has dissolved, leaving behind something quieter, something unspoken but understood.\n\nThen, without looking at you, Jordan mutters, \"Thanks.\"\n\nIt's quiet. Awkward. Like the word really isn't something he's used to saying out loud.\n\nYou glance at him, surprised. \"For what?\"\n\nJordan shifts slightly, finally glancing up at you. There's a flicker of hesitation in his expression, like he's debating if he actually wants to explain himself or if he should just let it go. But after a moment, he sighs and leans back against the couch.\n\n\"For this,\" he says simply, gesturing vaguely to the stage, the script, the empty theater around you. \"For actually taking it seriously. For not making it weird.\"\n\n\"Did you think I would make it weird?\" you ask.\n\nHe looks away. \"I don't know. People do.\"\n\nThe weight in his voice catches you off guard. Jordan's always been hard to read, always kept people at a distance—but now, for the first time, you're starting to see the cracks in the persona he's built around himself. The way he's always guarded, always cool and composed, like getting people too close would be some kind of mistake.\n\nAnd you, for whatever reason, get the feeling he's not thanking you for running lines. There's something else—something unspoken. Like he's relieved to just be here, without expectations, without anyone watching.\n\nYou nod slowly. \"Well... you're good. And I get why you care about this.\"\n\nJordan watches you for a second, his eyes unreadable. Then, almost like he's embarrassed, he exhales sharply and shakes his head. \"Whatever,\" he mutters, standing up and grabbing his bag. \"We should head out. It's getting late.\"\n\nYou push off the table, stretching again as you follow him toward the backstage exit. The night air is cool when you step outside, the streets quiet except for the occasional passing car. The streetlights cast long shadows across the pavement, and for a moment, the two of you just stand there, neither one of you in a rush to leave.\n\nJordan adjusts the strap of his bag and stares off down the street. \"Guess I'll see you in class.\"\n\nThere's an openness to his, like maybe—for the first time—he wouldn't mind if this didn't just end here.\n\nYou hesitate, then glance at him.\n\n[Choice: Ask Jordan if he wants to hang out]\n[Choice: Part ways]",

Maybe get food or something?\"\n\n Jordan stops adjusting his bag and looks at you, eyebrows slightly raised like he wasn't expecting the question. He shifts his weight, glancing down at the empty street, like he's considering whether to say no and go back to whatever his usual routine is. Then, after a beat, he exhales through his nose, a little quieter than a sigh but still reluctant.\n\n \"...Yeah, sure,\" he says. \"I could eat.\"\n\n It's not the most enthusiastic answer, but it's something.\n\n You walk together down the street, the conversation light, mostly about nothing—school, how Mr. Bennet's obsession with Romeo and Juliet is getting ridiculous, and the football game two days ago. It's not much, but it's easy, which is weird, considering how things usually are with him.\n\n After a few minutes, you reach Clancy's, a fast food place that's been around in Crestview Bay forever. It's nothing fancy—just a slightly worn-down restaurant with a faded red-and-white sign, flickering fluorescent lights, and the smell of grease and salt permanently baked into the air. The kind of place high schoolers and truckers alike keep in business.\n\n Jordan pushes the door open, and you step inside. The place is mostly empty except for a few people scattered at the booths and an exhausted-looking worker behind the counter, barely acknowledging you both as you approach the register.\n\n Jordan scans the menu quickly before crossing his arms. \"I'm getting a double cheeseburger, large fries, and a shake,\" he says, almost like he's making a statement rather than ordering food. You guess it makes sense—he's a quarterback. He probably runs through more calories in a day than you do in a week.\n\n \"I should've figured you'd eat like an athlete,\" you joke, glancing at the menu.\n\n Jordan raises an eyebrow. \"Figured you'd say something stupid,\" he replies dryly, his usual bite absent.\n\n You smirk, shaking your head before turning to the menu.\n [Choice: Get chicken nuggets and a drink]\n [Choice: Get a burger and fries]\n [Choice: Get the biggest thing on the menu]\n\n \n \"Yeah, see you in class,\" you say.\n\n Jordan nods once, shifting his bag on his shoulder.

His steps are steady, purposeful, but not rushed. The streetlights cast long shadows across the pavement, his figure cutting through the dim glow of the city.\n\n Even after tonight, he still feels like a mystery. You ran lines with him for hours, watched him break down a monologue with more focus and intensity than you've ever seen him put into anything at school, listened as he admitted that he actually cares about this. And yet, it still feels like you've only scratched the surface of who Jordan really is.\n\n Most people at school think they have him figured out. He's the star quarterback who can throw a perfect pass under pressure and walk through the halls like nothing in the world weighs on him. But that wasn't the Jordan you saw tonight.\n\n Tonight, you saw someone who thinks too much. Someone who pushes himself harder than he has to. Someone who isn't just good at acting—wants to be good at it. Someone who, for whatever reason, doesn't want anyone else to know that.\n\n You don't know why he asked you for help. Maybe it was just convenience—you're in theater, and he trusts you not to run your mouth. Or maybe it was something else.\n\n Either way, you're starting to wonder just how much more there is to Jordan than what he lets people see.\n\n A cool breeze cuts through the night, and you exhale, finally turning away. Whatever this was, whatever it meant—you'll have to figure that out later.\n\n For now, you slip your hands into your pockets and head home.\n\n [Choice: Go back home]",

      "text": "You scan the menu, considering your options. Something about a full burger feels like too much, but just getting fries and a drink seems like not enough. Eventually, you settle on something in between. \"I'll get six chicken nuggets and a drink,\" you say stepping forward to place your order.\n\n The cashier nods, pressing a few more buttons before listing off the total. You shift your weight, reaching into your pocket for your wallet—\n\n —but Jordan's already tapping his card against the reader.\n\n You freeze. Blink. \"What—?\"\n\n The machine beeps, and the screen flashes Approved. Jordan steps back, shoving his card into his pocket like nothing happened.\n\n You stare at him. \"Did you just—?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" he says, already turning away like it's not a big deal. \"What, you want me to ask for a refund?\"\n\n \"Not that, I just—\" You frown, baffled. \"Why'd you pay for mine?\"\n\n Jordan sighs, adjusting the strap of his bag over his shoulder. \"It's just some food, [name]. It's not that deep.\"\n\n You squint at him, trying to figure out if he's messing with you. \"You don't even like me that much.\"\n\n Jordan lets out a short huff that isn't quite a laugh. \"Yeah, well. Consider it payment for running lines.\"\n\n You cross your arms. \"You asked me to help you.\"\n\n \"And I paid you in nuggets,\" Jordan deadpans.\n\n You open your mouth to argue, then shut it, because... well, fair enough. You're not about to reject free food, even if you have no idea why Jordan suddenly decided to be generous.\n\n The cashier, barely engaged in the conversation, rips off the receipt and nods toward the side. \"Your tray will be ready in a sec.\"\n\n You step to the side with Jordan, waiting. The place smells like deep-fried grease and cheap soda syrup, and the menu screens flicker like they haven't been updated in decades. Behind the counter, you hear the clatter of baskets being lifted from bubbling oil and the faint hiss of a soda machine dispensing your drink into a cup.\n\n You glance at Jordan. He's standing with his arms crossed, eyes flicking over the restaurant, taking in the handful of late-night customers like he's analyzing a play. You wonder if he even realizes he does that—constantly scanning, constantly observing, like he can't ever fully turn it off.\n\n \"You always paying for other people's food, or am I just special?\" you ask after a beat.\n\n Jordan rolls his eyes. \"Don't push it.\"\n\n You smirk but decide not to press further.\n\n A minute later, the worker slides the tray onto the counter with a dull thud. \"Double cheeseburger, large fries, a shake, chicken nuggets, and a drink.\"\n\n Jordan grabs the tray without hesitation, barely waiting for you before heading toward the seating area. Jordan picks a booth near a window, away from the entrance, and slides into the sea. You sit across from him, watching as he takes the burger out of its wrapper with practiced ease.\n\n You take a nugget and pop it into your mouth before glancing at Jordan. \"So,\" you say, leaning back into your seat, \"since you're apparently trying to become the next big thing in theater, what plays have you actually watched?\"\n\n Jordan raises an eyebrow mid-bite, chewing slowly before responding. \"Enough.\"\n\n You scoff. \"Wow. Incredible answer. So detailed.\"\n\n He rolls his eyes, reaching for his shake. \"I don't know. A lot of the ones I've read in class. Death of a Salesman, A Streetcar Named Desire, The Crucible.\" He shrugs. \"Stuff like that.\"\n\n You frown. \"That's all school stuff. What about outside of class?\"\n\n Jordan is quiet for a second, his fingers tapping against the side of his cup. \"None.\"\n\n \"What do you mean none?\" you ask, blinking.\n\n He shrugs. \"Never seen one in person.\"\n\n That throws you off. Jordan, the guy who just spent hours perfecting a monologue, who cares about this enough to reach out for help, has never actually seen a play live?\n\n \"You're messing with me,\" you say, but Jordan just dips the fry into his shake and takes a bite like this is a completely normal conversation.\n\n \"I watch recordings,\" he says after a moment. \"Bootlegs. Clips. Whatever I can find.\"\n\n \"But why?\" you have to ask.\n\n Jordan doesn't answer right away. He just takes a sip of his shake, then says, \"My parents don't see the point.\"\n\n It's such a careful way of saying it, like he's not mad about it—just stating a fact. But the way his fingers tighten slightly around the cup tells you it's more than that.\n\n You don't push it. Instead, you shift the topic. \"Okay, so what have you watched?\"\n\n Jordan exhales, leaning back slightly. \"A lot. Hadestown, Sweeney Todd, Les Mis, West Side Story.\" He lists them off easily, like it's something he knows by heart. \"I like the ones where everything ties together. Where the music actually means something.\"\n\n You stare. \"You're into musicals?\"\n\n Jordan narrows his eyes. \"What, you thought I only liked Shakespeare?\"\n\n \"I thought you didn't like anything,\" you shoot back, still caught off guard. \"But you've seriously watched Les Mis?\"\n\n \"Like ten times,\" he says, as if it's not a big deal.\n\n You can't help but grin. \"Okay, that is surprising.\"\n\n Jordan shrugs. \"It's good.\"\n\n \"Just good?\"\n\n \"Fine, it's great,\" he admits. \"Happy?\"\n\n You smirk. \"Immensely.\"\n\n Jordan shakes his head, but you catch the tiniest flicker of amusement in his expression before he grabs another fry.\n\n It's weird. You never thought you'd be sitting across Jordan of all people, having a conversation about musicals, of all things. But here you are.\n\n \n You glance at the menu, scanning the options before settling on something simple. \"I'll just get a burger and fries,\" you say, stepping forward to pull out your phone.\n\n Before you can even do anything, Jordan reaches past you and slaps his card onto the counter. \"I got it,\" he says, completely casual, like it's not even a thing.\n\n You blink. \"Wait—what?\"\n\n Jordan doesn't even look at you, just letting the worker process the transaction. The little beep confirming the payment feels almost mocking.\n\n You stare at him. \"Did you just—\"\n\n \"Yeah.\" He steps back, crossing his arms as he waits for the food.\n\n \"You really didn't have to do that,\" you say, frowning.\n\n Jordan shrugs, barely reacting. \"I know.\"\n\n \"Then why—\"\n\n \"It's just food, dude,\" he says. \"Relax.\"\n\n You squint at him. \"You're being weird.\"\n\n Jordan finally looks at you, raising an eyebrow. \"Weird how, exactly?\"\n\n \"I don't know. You don't do things for people.\"\n\n Jordan scoffs, shaking his head. \"That's dramatic.\"\n\n \"Is it?\" You fold your arms, watching him. \"You don't even talk to people most of the time. And now you're just—what? Buying me dinner?\"\n\n Jordan exhales sharply, rubbing a hand over his face. \"Oh my God, [name], it's an eight-dollar meal, not a life debt.\"\n\n \"Still—\"\n\n \"Just take the free food before I change my mind.\"\n\n You huff, but drop it. There's no point arguing when he's being this stubborn.\n\n The cashier slides a tray toward the counter, loaded with two wrapped burgers, a mountain of fries, and two large drinks. Jordan grabs it without hesitation and turns toward the seating area like this is the most normal thing in the world.\n\n You hesitate for half a second before following.\n\n The booth he picks is near the window, slightly away from the few other people in the restaurant. The seats are worn down, the fake leather cracked from years of use, but Jordan doesn't seem to care. He slides the tray onto the table, sits down, and immediately unpacks his burger, like there's no need for conversation.\n\n You sit across him, watching as he takes a bite. The overhead fluorescent lights cast a dull yellow glow over the table, and the air smells like grease and fryer oil.\n\n You pick up a fry, pointing at him. \"So, you ever gonna admit theater's your favorite class, or are you gonna keep pretending it's just some elective you're stuck in?\"\n\n Jordan snorts, shaking his head. \"I don't pretend anything.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Right. That's why you're putting in extra hours running monologues instead of, I don't know, studying game footage or treating head injuries or whatever football players do in their free time.\"\n\n Jordan dips a fry into ketchup. \"I can like more than one thing.\"\n\n \"Sure,\" you say. \"But you really like this. More than football.\"\n\n Jordan pauses mid-bite. He doesn't confirm it, but he also doesn't deny it. Instead, he leans back against the booth, staring at the window for a second before finally saying, \"It's different.\"\n\n \"How so?\"\n\n He picks up his burger but doesn't take a bite, just holds it like he needs something to fidget with. \"In football, everything's decided before you even step on the field. The play's called, the formations are set, and you already know exactly what you're supposed to do. It's all execution.\" He exhales, shaking his head. \"But on stage? You become something else. Someone else. And for a few minutes, it's like... the rest of the world doesn't exist.\"\n\n His voice shifts as he talks—more animated, more real. He's not trying to sound detached or keep his usual wall up. He's just talking, and for the first time, you can actually hear how much this means to him.\n\n \"You know that feeling when you're in a scene and it just clicks?\" he continues. \"When you say something, and it's not even you anymore—it's the character? The audience is holding their breath, waiting on you, and you know you've got them?\" He shakes his head, exhaling a quiet laugh. \"It's the best damn feeling in the world. It's like—\"\n\n He cuts himself off.\n\n You watch as his expression shifts, like he just caught himself slipping. The passion in his eyes dulls, replaced by something more guarded. He picks up his drink and takes a sip, staring down at the table.\n\n \"...It's fun,\" he mutters, suddenly distant again. \"That's all.\"\n\n You don't say anything right away. You just watch him, the way his fingers drum idly against the cup, the way his shoulders have tensed just slightly—like he's trying to put the walls back up as fast as he let them fall.\n\n But you saw it. For a few seconds, he wasn't Jordan-the-athlete, Jordan-the-quarterback. He was just Jordan. The person. And he cared a lot.\n\n You lean back in your seat, tossing another fry into your mouth. \"You know,\" you say casually, \"for someone who doesn't pretend anything, you sure like pretending you don't care about theater as much as you do.\"\n\n Jordan huffs a laugh but doesn't look up. \"Shut up, [name].\"\n\n \"I'm not wrong, though.\"\n\n \"Shut up.\"\n\n You smirk, but you let it go. Even if he won't say it out loud, you both know the truth now.\n\n \n \n You glance at the menu, then at Jordan, then back at the menu again. If he's going all out, you might as well match the energy.\n\n \"Yeah, I'll take the Mega Clancy Combo,\" you say, pointing at the biggest thing on the board—a double-patty burger stacked with bacon, onion rings, and a 'secret sauce' that's definitely just glorified mayo. It also comes with a mountain of fries and a large drink.\n\n Jordan turns his head slightly, giving you a once-over like he's questioning your life choices. \"You sure about that?\"\n\n You shrug. \"What, you think I can't handle it?\"\n\n He doesn't answer, just shakes his head a little before turning back to the cashier. \"Yeah, okay.\"\n\n The worker, who looks like she's five seconds away from quitting, barely acknowledges the challenge in your tone and just punches in the order with a deadpan expression. \"That'll be [19].99,\" she mutters.\n\n As you reach for your wallet, Jordan beats you to it, sliding his card across the counter before you can even react.\n\n You blink. \"Wait—what are you—?\"\n\n \"Relax,\" Jordan mutters, eyes on the cashier as she processes the transaction before shoving the receipt in his direction. \"It's not a big deal.\"\n\n \"Not a big deal? You just—\" You gesture vaguely at the register, still processing the fact that Jordan, of all people, just paid for your ridiculous, oversized meal without a second thought.\n\n Jordan picks up the receipt and crumples it in his fist like it's nothing. \"You gonna stand here and freak out, or are we eating?\"\n\n You stare at him. Hard. \"You just made fun of me for ordering this much food. And now you're paying for it?\"\n\n Jordan sighs, clearly regretting all his life choices. \"Oh my God, [name]. Just take the free food and move on.\"\n\n Still mildly stunned, your mind runs in circles. Jordan never asks for favors, never reaches out, and definitely never does anything unnecessary for other people.\n\n So why did he just casually buy your food like it was no big deal?\n\n The two of you linger by the counter, waiting as the kitchen slaps together your orders with the kind of lazy efficiency that only late-night fast-food places have.\n\n \"Hope you know what you're doing,\" Jordan eventually says, crossing his arms.\n\n You smirk. \"What, eating a burger? I've got that down.\"\n\n He huffs out a short breath that might be a laugh, then glances at the empty booths lining the restaurant. \"We're sitting down, right?\"\n\n \"Unless you'd rather eat in awkward silence by the soda machine,\" you joke.\n\n Jordan doesn't bother to respond, just grabbing his tray the second the food is ready and making his way to a booth near the window. You follow, setting down your own tray with a solid thud.\n\n The Mega Clancy Combo is... bigger than you expected. The burger alone is nearly the size of your face, the fries are spilling out of the carton, and your drink is big enough that you're pretty sure it could double as a bucket in an emergency.\n\n Jordan eyes your tray, unimpressed. \"Good luck with that,\" he mutters, unwrapping his own burger.\n\n You scoff. \"I don't need luck. I've got determination.\"\n\n Jordan doesn't say anything, opting to just take a bite of his burger while watching you like you're about to regret all your life choices.\n\n The first few bites are fine—great, even. Salty, greasy, a perfect mix of crunchy onion rings and melted cheese. The fries are crisp, the soda is ice-cold, and for the first time in a while, you realize just how hungry you actually were.\n\n But about halfway through, you start to slow down.\n\n The grease is hitting. The sheer volume of the food is hitting. The drink, which seemed like a good idea at first, is now just a challenge you weren't prepared for.\n\n Jordan notices immediately. \"Oh my God,\" he mutters, shaking his head. \"You're struggling.\"\n\n \"I am not struggling,\" you lie, pushing through another bite even as your stomach starts to protest.\n\n Jordan leans back and watches you with clear amusement. \"Uh-huh.\"\n\n You take another bite. Then another. And then you reach a point where your body is actively rejecting the idea of one more bite of burger, like you've hit a physical wall. You set it down with a deep breath, gripping your drink for support.\n\n Jordan, who's already finished his meal like it was nothing, raises an eyebrow. \"So, [name]. You gonna finish that?\"\n\n You glare at him. \"Give me a second.\"\n\n He smirks, clearly entertained by your suffering. \"Should I call for backup? Maybe get Mr. Bennet in here to deliver an inspirational monologue about pushing through adversity?\"\n\n You groan, leaning back in your seat. \"I hate you.\"\n\n \"Nah,\" he says, picking up a fry. \"You just hate losing.\"\n\n You don't respond. You can't, really. Not when you're sitting here, defeated by a burger of all things.\n\n Jordan just shakes his head, a rare smirk at the corner of his lips as he finishes the rest of his fries, completely unbothered. \"I told you so.\"\n\n And honestly? You don't even have the energy to argue.\n \n\n[Choice: Finish eating]",

      "text": "\"So,\" you say. \"That was a big win on Friday.\"\n\n Jordan doesn't react immediately, staring out the window at the empty parking lot. \"Yeah.\"\n\n You wait for him to say more, but he doesn't.\n\n \"You don't sound all that excited,\" you point out.\n\n Jordan huffs out a small breath, not quite a laugh but something close. \"What do you want me to say?\"\n\n \"I don't know, maybe something like, 'Hell yeah, we won, best game of my life!'\" You throw up your arms for emphasis. \"That's what Luke sounded like after the game.\"\n\n \"Yeah, well, Luke loves this stuff,\" Jordan sets his cup down, turning his gaze back to you. \"I don't.\"\n\n You don't have to ask him what he means—you already have a pretty good guess. People say Jordan comes from a football family. His dad, his mom, even his older brother—all-star athletes. You don't actually know the details, just the rumors that get tossed around school. That Jordan was basically built for this, that his family had him throwing a football before he could walk, that he had no choice but to be good.\n\n You don't know how much of it is true, but looking at him now—the way he's picking absently at the paper wrapper on his tray—you're starting to think there's at least some truth to it.\n\n \"That sucks,\" you say honestly.\n\n Jordan gives you a flat look. \"Wow. Amazing insight. Really cracking the code here.\"\n\n You roll your eyes. \"I mean, I could be fake and tell you how inspiring it is that you're following in your family's footsteps, but let's be real, you'd just tell me to shut up.\"\n\n He exhales sharply, almost a laugh.\n\n Leaning back against the booth, he stretches one arm over the seat, letting his fingers tap idly against the fake leather. \"It's not like I hate it,\" he mutters. \"I'm good at it. I win games. Whatever.\" His eyes flicker to the window, watching the dim glow of the streetlights outside. \"It's just... not really mine, you know?\"\n\n You do know, at least a little. Although you've never been in his exact position, you get what he means. Jordan's a quarterback because that's what he's supposed to be. Because people expect it.\n\n \"Then why don't you quit?\" you ask.\n\n Jordan exhales through his nose, shaking his head slightly, like the question isn't even worth considering. \"It's not that simple.\"\n\n You don't press him on it.\n\n The conversation dips into a lull. It isn't awkward though, just quiet. You glance at Jordan, who's just staring off into the distance, his mind clearly elsewhere.\n\n After a moment, you decide to shift the topic. \"You know, if we're talking about things people are actually excited about, the cheer team was hyped after the game. I'm pretty sure Jessica was ready to throw a parade for herself.\"\n\n Jordan snorts, shaking his head. \"Yeah, that tracks.\"\n\n \"You don't watch the routines at all, do you?\" you ask, smirking.\n\n \"I mean, I see them,\" he says. \"Kinda hard to miss a bunch of people flipping around in front of you before kickoff. But it's not like I'm watching them.\"\n\n \"Wow, rude.\"\n\n Jordan raises an eyebrow. \"Oh, so you care about the cheer team now?\"\n\n It's a harmless, offhand comment, but it lingers in the air a little too long. If he knew, if he realized—\n\n This is your chance.\n\n [Choice: Tell him you're on the team]\n [Choice: Decide not to tell him the truth]\n\n \n Inside Clancy's, it's just you and Jordan, sitting across from each other in a booth that's seen better days. Neither of you speak at first. There's no rush to fill the silence, after all.\n\n Eventually, you lean back against the booth. \"So. Football.\"\n\n Jordan, who had been idly drumming his fingers against the edge of the table, stops. His expression doesn't change much, but there's a flicker of something in his eyes, gone just as quickly as it appeared. \"What about it?\"\n\n You shrug. \"Figured you'd have more to say after Friday.\"\n\n Jordan exhales sharply through his nose, shaking his head. \"Not really.\"\n\n \"You guys played well,\" you offer. \"It was close.\"\n\n Jordan scoffs. \"Close doesn't mean anything.\" His voice is calm, steady, but there's a sharpness beneath it. \"Nobody remembers almost winning.\"\n\n You study him for a moment. His posture is loose, arms crossed, body leaned back like he's relaxed, but his jaw is tight and his gaze flicks toward the window like he'd rather be anywhere else.\n\n \"You pissed about it?\" you ask.\n\n Jordan doesn't answer right away. He shifts slightly, like the question is heavier than it should be. \"Doesn't matter,\" he mutters.\n\n \"That a yes?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n Jordan exhales, running a hand through his hair before finally looking at you. \"Losing's just annoying, that's all,\" he says. \"I don't need to hear about it for the next week.\"\n \n The way he says it—flat, casual—tells you there's more to it. He's not mad about the game. He's mad about what comes after.\n\n You don't push, but you don't drop it either. \"Could've been worse,\" you say. \"At least the cheer team showed up.\"\n\n Jordan huffs, shaking his head. \"Barely.\"\n\n You frown. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n \"You really think that was a normal performance?\" he asks, giving you a pointed look.\n\n You think about Friday. The cheerleaders were there, but something had been off. The energy, the coordination—it wasn't the usual polished, high-energy routine they were known for. Jessica had tried, you could tell, but they had been one person short, and it showed. The formations weren't as sharp, the stunts weren't as clean, and even the usual commanding presence she brought to the field had felt... unsteady.\n\n She had held it together in front of the crowd, but you caught a glimpse of her on the sidelines—eyes wet, jaw clenched, her perfectly composed mask slipping for just a moment before she turned away.\n\n Most people probably hadn't noticed. But Jordan? Apparently, he had.\n\n \"They were off,\" he mutters, shaking his head. \"Jessica almost lost it after halftime.\"\n\n \"You noticed that?\" you ask.\n\n Jordan shrugs like it's not a big deal. \"Hard not to. She looked like she was about to cry.\"\n\n You frown. \"She was trying.\"\n\n \"Yeah, she did,\" Jordan says simply, looking away toward the mirror. \"Didn't help.\"\n\n There's no cruelty in his voice, only bluntness. He's not dismissing the effort, just stating the fact that it hadn't been enough. The fact that he picked up on Jessica struggling—hell, the fact that he cared enough to bring it up—means something, even if he won't admit it.\n\n \"So, what?\" you ask. \"You feel bad for her?\"\n\n Jordan scoffs, leaning back in his seat. \"I'm not heartless, y'know,\" he mutters.\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"That's debatable.\"\n\n Jordan shakes his head, but the corner of his mouth twitches slightly, like he's almost amused.\n\n You glance down at the table, your fingers tapping idly against the surface as the conversation lingers in the air. You wonder in which direction you should take the conversation.\n\n [Choice: Are you still mad about the game?]\n [Choice: So, do you actually care about cheerleading?]",

      "text": "\"Yeah, actually,\" you say. \"I'm on the team.\"\n\n \n Jordan barely reacts at first. He just blinks at you, like the words take an extra second to register. Then his eyebrows pull together slightly, his expression caught somewhere between confusion and mild disbelief.\n\n \"You're—\" He stops, eyes narrowing as he processes it. Then, something clicks. \"Oh. Right. I remember now.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Do you?\"\n\n Jordan exhales, rubbing the back of his neck like he's trying to piece things together. \"Yeah. After the game. You—\" He makes a vague gesture, like that's enough to fill in the details. \"You told me then. I just... forgot.\"\n\n \"You forgot?\" You can't help but laugh a little. \"Wow, okay. Glad to know my big reveal was so memorable.\"\n\n Jordan shakes his head, muttering, \"Shut up,\" but there's no heat behind it. He leans back against the booth, arms crossed. \"I don't know. That whole night was a mess. I was pissed about the game, and then you—\" He stops again, like he's trying to find the right words. \"It just didn't register.\"\n\n You watch him for a second. He's not deflecting, not avoiding—it really didn't stick in his head, and honestly? That kind of tracks. Jordan was completely in his own head after the game. You probably could've told him you were a Russian spy and gotten the same reaction.\n\n Still, you smirk. \"So, what, it's only clicking now because I brought up cheerleading?\"\n\n \"Pretty much,\" Jordan admits without shame. He tilts his head slightly, eyeing you in a way that makes you feel like you're under inspection. \"So you're really into it, huh?\"\n\n It's not judgmental;. Just curious. Like he's actually trying to figure out why you joined the team.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say simply. \"I am.\"\n\n Jordan holds your gaze for a second longer, then just nods, accepting it without another word. He doesn't pry, doesn't tease, doesn't even act like it's weird. He just takes it as fact.\n\n \"Well,\" he says, \"guess that explains why Jessica hasn't shut up about the 'new talent' on the squad.\"\n\n You groan. \"Oh my God, please don't call me that.\"\n\n Jordan smirks. \"Too late.\"\n\n And like that, the conversation moves on, like it's just another part of who you are.\n \n \n Jordan pauses. He takes a second to process things before giving you a look—not shocked, exactly, but definitely surprised. \"Wait. You're on the cheer team?\"\n\n You shrug. \"Yeah.\"\n\n He stares at you for a second, like he's waiting for you to follow it up with a punchline. When you don't, he exhales, leans back against the booth, and mutters, \"Huh.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Huh?\" That's all he has to say?\n\n Jordan tilts his head slightly. \"I mean, I didn't expect it, but I guess it makes sense.\"\n\n You blink. \"It does?\"\n\n It's his turn to shrug now. \"You were on the field on Friday, right?\"\n\n \"Yeah.\"\n\n \"And I didn't notice.\"\n\n You frown. \"Wow, okay. Rude.\"\n\n Jordan smirks slightly, unbothered. \"It's really not my fault you blend in.\"\n\n \"You're literally throwing a ball right in front of us during the routines.\"\n\n \"Yeah, and I'm looking at the ball.\"\n\n You scoff and shake your head while Jordan acts like this entire conversation is the most normal thing in the world.\n\n After a moment, he asks, \"So, why'd you join? Did you always want to do it or...?\"\n\n \"Nah,\" you admit. \"Jessica recruited me after Mandy moved to Iowa. They needed another person, and she figured I'd work.\"\n\n Jordan nods like that explanation is perfectly reasonable. \"Yeah, that sounds like Jessica.\"\n\n He doesn't question it. Doesn't make a joke. Doesn't look at you like you're some kind of anomaly.\n\n You study him for a second. \"You're really not gonna say anything else?\"\n\n \"Like what?\" he asks, raising an eyebrow.\n\n \"I don't know, something about how I'm a guy on the girl's team? Or how it's weird or whatever?\"\n\n Jordan gives you a dry look. \"[name], you're talking to a guy who has to sit through half-time speeches about how football is 'the last great battle of modern men' while Coach screams about dominance and territory. You think cheerleading is what's gonna throw me?\"\n\n ...Okay. You had to admit that was kind of a solid point.\n\n He adds, \"Besides, I don't really care what people do. You're on the team. Cool. Hope you don't drop anyone.\"\n\n You snort. \"Gee, thanks for the support.\"\n\n \"Anytime.\"\n\n And just like that, the conversation moves on, the reveal slipping into the past as easily as it was brought up.\n \n \n \n You shrug. \"Something like that.\"\n\n Jordan raises an eyebrow. \"What does that mean?\"\n\n \"Just that I've been paying more attention than you have,\" you say, smirking slightly.\n\n Jordan huffs and leans back against the booth. \"That's not a high bar.\"\n\n You snort. \"Yeah, no kidding. You'd think the guy throwing the ball would at least pretend to care about the people hyping up the crowd.\"\n\n Jordan gives you a flat look. \"I've got more important things to focus on.\"\n\n \"Uh-huh. Like standing there looking broody between plays?\"\n\n Jordan doesn't dignify that with a response. There's a flicker of something in his expression—maybe mild curiosity, maybe nothing—but he doesn't push the topic any further.\n\n The conversation lingers for a second longer before fading into something more comfortable. The two of you sitting in a nearly empty fast-food joint, trays cleared, nothing urgent to rush off to.\n\n \"We should head out soon,\" Jordan says.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you agree, stretching your arms out with a sigh. \"Good call.\"\n\n And just like that, the conversation drifts to an end. Whatever Jordan thinks about your vague answer, he doesn't press for more. And you don't offer it either. Not yet.\n \n\n \n \n \"So, are you still mad about the game?\" you ask gently, probing for information.\n\n Jordan doesn't answer right away. He leans back in his seat, arms crossed over his chest, his gaze shifting toward the window. The neon lights cast a dull reflection against the glass, warping hsi expression just enough that you can't quite read him.\n\n For a second, you think he's going to shut you down completely. That he's going to roll his eyes, scoff, and tell you to drop it.\n\n But then, with a quiet exhale, he mutters, \"It's not the game that pisses me off.\"\n\n You blink. \"Then what is?\"\n\n \"The aftermath,\" Jordan says, his jaw tightening.\n\n It takes a second for the meaning to settle, but when it does, it clicks into place a little too easily.\n\n You don't know much about Jordan's family—just bits and pieces from things other people have said. His family is full of athletes, the kind of people who treat sports as more than just a game. They expect wins. They expect perfection. And when they don't get it..\n\n You suddenly have a pretty good idea of what kind of 'aftermath' Jordan is talking about.\n\n \"I mean, it's just one loss,\" you say cautiously. \"Is that really that big of a deal?\"\n\n Jordan exhales sharply through his nose, shaking his head. \"To me? No. To them?\" He lets out a quiet, humorless scoff. \"Everything is a big deal.\"\n\n He doesn't elaborate, but he doesn't have to. You can hear the edge in his voice, the way it flattens a little too much—like he's trying not to sound bitter, trying not to sound like it gets to him.\n\n But it does.\n\n You don't press him on it. You don't ask for specifics, don't make him spell it out for you. If he wanted to, he would. But the way his fingers drum lightly against the table, the way his shoulders are just a little too tense even now, even two days after the game? That tells you enough.\n\n After a long moment, he finally glances at you. \"Not like it matters,\" he says, voice quiet but firm. \"Next game's Friday. We win, they shut up.\"\n\n \"And if you lose?\"\n\n Jordan's fingers stop tapping and his jaw clenches slightly. \"Then I deal with it.\"\n\n It's so simple the way he says it. Like it's just fact. Like it's normal.\n\n It makes you wonder how many times he's had to 'deal with it' before.\n\n Not wanting to push him, you let the conversation drift, fading into the soft hum of the nearly empty restaurant.\n \n \n \"So, do you actually care about cheerleading?\" you ask.\n\n Jordan exhales through his nose, shaking his head. \"Not really.\"\n\n \"Uh-huh,\" you say, raising an eyebrow. \"Sure.\"\n\n He shoots you a flat look. \"I don't.\"\n\n \"You just pointed out how they were off on Friday,\" you remind him. \"And you noticed Jessica nearly crying. That's got to be some level of caring.\"\n\n Jordan leans back in his seat, gaze flicking toward the window, watching the occasional headlights pass by. For a second, you think he's not going to answer. Then, finally, he shrugs. \"I don't usually pay attention. When they're doing their job, it's just noise.\"\n\n You huff out a short laugh. \"Bet Jessica would love to hear that.\"\n\n Jordan ignores the jab. \"But when they're not doing it right? It's impossible to notice. The crowd was off. The energy was off. And yeah, Jessica was off too.\"\n\n You frown slightly. \"She did her best.\"\n\n Jordan doesn't argue, instead nodding like he already knows that. \"I've never seen her like that before,\" he admits. \"I mean, I've seen her pissed, I've seen her focused—but this was different.\"\n\n You think back to Friday. Jessica had been holding it together, but the second the halftime routine ended, you'd seen her expression crack, just for a moment. The frustration, the disappointment in herself. And Jordan, somehow, had picked up on it too.\n\n \"You ever think about how much she actually cares about that stuff?\" Jordan asks suddenly.\n\n You blink. \"What?\"\n\n \"Jessica. Cheerleading. The whole thing. She's not just doing it, she's in it. Like all the way. Losing a game means nothing to me, but a bad routine? That wrecked her.\"\n\n It's a rare thing, hearing Jordan talk like this—actually noticing someone. And it's true, Jessica isn't just passionate about cheerleading; it's everything to her. The routines, the performances, the way the team carries itself. It's not just a hobby, not just an extracurricular, it's who she is.\n\n Jordan shrugs, glancing back down at the table. \"Guess I just didn't expect that.\"\n\n There's a pause, a beat of silence between you.\n\n Then you smirk. \"You sure you don't care about cheerleading?\"\n\n Jordan rolls his eyes, shaking his head. \"Not like that.\"\n\n You chuckle, letting it go. But something about the way he said it lingers—like maybe, just maybe, Jordan notices more than he lets on.\n \n \n\n[Choice: The end of a hangout]",

The sidewalks are mostly deserted at this hour, save for the occasional passing car in the distance, its headlights sweeping over the pavement.\n\nYou and Jordan walk in silence for a moment, the quiet stretching between you—not awkward, but not entirely comfortable either. It's the kind of silence that lingers after a conversation that went a little deeper than expected, when neither person really knows what to say next.\n\nJordan adjusts the strap of his bag, his eyes fixed ahead. He's not walking fast, not like he's in a hurry to leave, but he maintains that same sense of distance in the way he moves. Like even when he's standing next to you, he's still keeping a piece of himself somewhere else.\n\n\"You heading home?\" you ask eventually.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he says simply.\n\nYou nod. \"Same.\"\n\nAnother pause. The streetlights flicker slightly as you both walk beneath them. You wonder, for a second, if this whole night is just going to disappear into nothing. If Jordan's just going to pretend this never happened once you both go back to school tomorrow.\n\nBut then, as you reach the intersection where you'll have to split off, Jordan slows to a stop. He shifts his weight, glancing at you briefly before looking down at his own street.\n\n\"...Thanks for coming,\" he says, like the words are foreign in his mouth, like he doesn't quite know how to say them properly. \"For the lines. And, uh... this, I guess.\"\n\nYou blink, surprised. Jordan doesn't thank people. At least, not that you've ever seen.\n\n\"You sound like you're being held at gunpoint,\" you say, chuckling.\n\nJordan exhales sharply. \"Forget it.\" He turns, ready to walk off, but you catch the faintest hint of something—not annoyance, not irritation, but maybe a little embarrassment. Like he's not used to this.\n\n\"Hey,\" you call after him.\n\nHe glances back, waiting.\n\nYou pause for a second, debating if you should say something meaningful, something reflective. But in the end, you just nod. \"See you in class.\"\n\nAnd with that, he turns and walks away, disappearing into the dim glow of the streetlights.\n\nYou watch him go for a moment before heading off in your own direction, the quiet of the night settling around you. Maybe this was just a random night, just a favor he needed, nothing more.\n\nBut somehow, it doesn't feel like nothing.\n\n[Choice: Finish up]",

      "text": "Day 14 Luke Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \nCrestview Bay's town center is the kind of place that always has just enough happening to feel alive but never enough to feel overwhelming. The main square is lined with small shops, cafés, and a few restaurants with outdoor seating, their tables shaded by striped umbrellas. The scent of fresh bread drifts from the local bakery, mixing with the salty breeze rolling in from the bay. It's where families stroll, old couples feed the birds, and kids kill time when there's nowhere else to be.\n\nYou weave through the mild afternoon crowd, scanning for Luke. He hadn't been specific in his text—just \"Meet me in town, I'll be around!\"—which, honestly, is the most Luke thing ever. No details, no exact location, just the assumption that you'd figure it out.\n\nAnd, as it turns out, figuring it out is easy.\n\nBecause Luke is currently standing on the rim of the central fountain, arms outstretched for balance, wobbling precariously like a complete idiot.\n\nYou slow your steps, watching with both amusement and secondhand embarrassment. He's in casual clothes—jeans, sneakers, and a loose hoodie—but that effortless athlete confidence is still there, the kind that says \"yeah, I could probably stick the landing if I wanted to.\"\n\nSome older man sitting on a nearby bench watches him too, shaking his head like he's about to witness the dumbest accident of the day.\n\nLuke takes another step along the rim, his sneakers slipping slightly against the wet stone, but instead of getting down like a normal person, he just grins to himself and keeps going.\n\nYou sigh. \"Luke, what the hell are you doing?\"\n\nAt the sound of your voice, he glances over, shifting his weight slightly—except he overcorrects, loses his balance, and in the span of about two seconds, he has to do a ridiculous windmilling flail to keep himself from falling straight into the fountain.\n\nBy some miracle, he manages to jump off at the last second, landing on solid ground with all the grace of someone pretending they meant to do that.\n\nHe straightens up, shakes out his arms, and acts like none of that just happened. \"Oh, hey,\" he says, as if you hadn't just watched him nearly eat pavement.\n\nYou cross your arms. \"You good?\"\n\n\"Yeah, totally.\" He gestures vaguely back at the fountain. \"I was just—uh—seeing if I could still do that balance thing, you know? Like when we were kids? I used to be able to walk all the way around the edge without falling off.\"\n\nYou glance at the slippery, uneven stone. \"Yeah, well, maybe don't test that theory.\"\n\nLuke exhales dramatically, shaking his head. \"[name], where's your sense of adventure?\"\n\n\"Luke, where's your sense of self-preservation?\"\n\n\"Fair point,\" he concedes, cracking his neck. Then he looks at you properly, his usual easy energy settling into something more natural.\n\n\"I wasn't sure you'd actually come,\" he admits, shoving his hands into his hoodie pocket. \"Figured you might be busy. Or, I dunno, just not in the mood.\"\n\nThere's no accusation in his voice, no guilt-tripping. Just an honest acknowledgment that sometimes people don't show up.\n\nBut you're here. And judging by the way Luke's shoulders relax slightly, that means something to him.\n\n\"Guess I wasn't in the mood to let you crack your skull open alone,\" you say.\n\nLuke grins. \"See? That's real friendship.\"\n\nHe nods toward the rest of the square, and just like that, the day unfolds in front of you both.\n\n[Choice: Come on, let's go]",

      "text": "Luke leads the way through Crestview Bay's town center, moving with his usual easy confidence, but there's something a little more relaxed about him today. The two of you weave past the Sunday afternoon crowd—families pushing strollers, couples lingering outside café windows, street musicians playing for spare change. The salty breeze from the bay mixes with the scent of warm bread from the bakery and fresh coffee from the open-air cafés.\n\n\"Hey,\" Luke says, nodding toward a small setup near the corner of the square. \"That's new.\"\n\nYou follow his gaze and spot a temporary flower stand tucked beneath a pastel canopy. It's simple but inviting, a wooden table covered in fresh-cut flowers arranged in clusters—soft pink peonies, delicate sprigs of lavender, cheerful sunflowers standing tall in mason jars. A small sign, carefully written in looping handwriting, leans against the table.\n\n\"Fresh Flowers, Fresh Smiles. Take some beauty with you.\"\n\nBehind the table, a woman sits wrapping a bouquet in brown paper. She looks to be in her early thirties, with long, dark hair cascading over her shoulders and a quiet grace about her. She has the kind of presence that makes you slow down, like she belongs here even though the flower stand is temporary. There's something warm and steady in the way she moves, like she's savoring each small action—tying twine around a bouquet, brushing stray petals off the table, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear.\n\nAt her feet, resting beside a basket of smaller floral arrangements, is a dog—a very, very good dog.\n\nA massive, fluffy white Samoyed lounges on the ground like a cloud that decided to take a break from floating. A green plush toy is clutched gently in her mouth, and her dark eyes scan the passing people with a quiet curiosity. It's almost like she's the true owner of this flower stand, carefully assessing potential customers. The afternoon sun catches her thick fur, making her practically glow.\n\nLuke stops mid-step.\n\n\"Oh my God,\" he breathes, his entire focus shifting instantly. \"Do you see this dog?\"\n\nYou barely have time to respond before Luke is already stepping closer, his expression somewhere between awe and unfiltered joy. \"Look at her! She's perfect. She's majestic. This is the best dog I've ever seen. This is—this is art.\"\n\nThe dog doesn't move, but her tail gives a single slow wag.\n\nLuke clasps his hands together like he's witnessing something sacred. \"I need to pet her. I have to pet her.\"\n\nThe woman behind the stand glances up, amused. \"She does take bribes,\" she says lightly, nodding toward the basket of flowers.\n\nLuke gasps. \"I will buy flowers if that's what it takes.\"\n\nLuke turns to you with the wide-eyed intensity of someone who has just discovered their life's purpose. \"[name]. We are buying flowers.\"\n\nYou cross your arms. \"Didn't you say flowers were a frivolous purchase and that you've never bought them before?\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, people change,\" Luke says, already reaching for his wallet. \"I'm a flower guy now.\"\n\nThe woman behind the stand laughs softly, finishing the bouquet she was wrapping and setting it aside. Now that you're closer, you can see the warmth in her expression—the quiet kind, the kind that makes you feel welcome even though you've only just met. There's something grounded about her, like she's settled into herself in a way most people never quite manage.\n\n\"Her name's Luna,\" she says, nodding toward the dog. \"And I'm Marky. She's the real reason people stop, but I pretend it's for the flowers.\"\n\n\"Luna,\" Luke repeats like it's the most beautiful name he's ever heard. He crouches slightly, holding out a hand. \"Luna, my beloved, my light, my queen—may I give you the scritches you deserve?\"\n\nLuna, still holding her toy, tilts her head slightly, assessing him. Then, after a long, considering pause, she shifts forward just enough to bump her nose against his knuckles.\n\nLuke lets out an audible gasp, eyes shining. \"She has blessed me.\"\n\nMarky shakes her head, amused. \"She has accepted you. That's different. Full blessing requires more treats.\"\n\nLuke nods solemnly. \"Understandable. She's a businesswoman. Gotta keep the economy running.\" He scratches behind Luna's ears, looking absolutely thrilled about it.\n\nYou watch with a smirk. \"You're having a religious experience over there.\"\n\n\"Don't judge me,\" Luke says without looking up. \"You wish you were having this moment.\"\n\nLuna lets out a soft huff, still holding onto her toy, like she knows exactly how much power she holds right now.\n\nAfter a moment, Marky shifts slightly behind the stand, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. \"So,\" she says, turning to you both, \"if I'm understanding correctly, I'm about to make a sale purely because you wanted to pet my dog?\"\n\n\"Correct,\" Luke says immediately. \"It's called mutually beneficial transactions.\"\n\nMarky laughs, but there's something knowing in her expression. \"Well, now that you're here, you might as well pick something you like.\"\n\nLuke finally, finally stands up, reluctantly tearing himself away from Luna as he surveys the flowers. His gaze moves over the display, thoughtful in a way you don't usually see from him.\n\nThere's something about the flower stand itself that invites stillness. Maybe it's the care in the way the bouquets are wrapped, or the way the petals catch the afternoon sunlight, or maybe it's just Marky's presence—calm and steady like someone who's made peace with the little things in life.\n\nYou look over at the flowers as well. They're all fresh and carefully arranged, each bouquet seeming to have a distinct feeling attached to it.\n\nMarky rests her hands lightly on the wooden counter. \"Are you buying for someone or for yourself?\"\n\nLuke hesitates. \"Haven't decided yet.\"\n\n\"Then pick something that makes you feel good,\" she says simply.\n\nLuke hums, still scanning the selection. \"Alright. What do you recommend?\"\n\nMarky studied him for a second before reaching for a bouquet of sunflowers. She lifts them gently, turning them slightly so the golden petals catch the light.\n\n\"Sunflowers,\" she says. \"They turn toward the sun no matter what. They remind people to keep looking for the light, even on the hard days.\"\n\nLuke blinks, caught off guard by the answer. \"...Huh.\"\n\nYou glance at him. He looks at the sunflowers like he's seeing them for the first time again, like the meaning behind them actually sinks in a little. He rubs the back of his neck. \"That's pretty cool, actually.\"\n\nMarky just smiles. \"They suit you.\"\n\nShe turns to you next. \"And you?\"\n\nYou weren't planning on buying anything, but something about the moment makes you hesitate. The flowers are beautiful, sure—but it's more than that. It's the atmosphere, the simplicity of it all. It feels like something you might not get the chance to do again, and for some reason, that makes it feel more important.\n\nMarky doesn't push. She just waits patiently.\n\n<<if [money] > 9>> \n [Choice: Buy a bouquet]\n \n<<if [money] > 4>> \n [Choice: Buy a few flowers]\n \n[Choice: Buy nothing]",

There's something about this place that makes the moment feel like it means something.\n\n \"...Alright,\" you say, exhaling slightly. \"I'll take a full bouquet.\"\n\n Marky's lips curve into a gentle smile, like she already knew you'd say that. \"Good choice,\" she murmurs, turning toward the flowers.\n\n Her fingers move carefully as she selects them, not just picking at random, but deliberately choosing each stem. She pucks soft, delicate lilacs, rich in color and full in bloom, then carefully adds sprigs of baby's breath, their tiny white blossoms filling in space. A few lavender stalks come next before she finally tucks in a single white camellia—pristine, elegant, and striking.\n\n She wraps them in brown paper, tying them off with a simple but sturdy twine bow before handing them to you. \"Here,\" she says, her voice light. \"You picked well.\"\n\n Before you can even think of something to say back, there's a sudden shift at your side—Luna, previously resting calmly, gets up and steps forward, sniffing the bouquet in your hands before tilting her head up to look at you directly.\n\n Then, without hesitation, she nudges your leg and flops onto her back, big paws in the air, belly completely exposed.\n\n Luke stares. \"No way.\"\n\n Marky raises an eyebrow, genuinely surprised. \"Huh. That's new.\"\n\n \"She wants belly rubs?\" Luke asks, eyes wide. \"This dog doesn't just hand out belly rubs, right?\"\n\n Marky shakes her head in amusement. \"Not usually, no. She's... selective.\"\n\n Luke claps you on the back, grinning. \"Dude. You unlocked her.\"\n\n You can't help but laugh as you crouch down, setting your bouquet carefully on the edge of the stand before reaching out and running a hand through the thick, impossibly soft fur of Luna's belly. She lets out a content huff, wiggling slightly as if she's making herself even more comfortable.\n\n Luke, not wanting to be left out on this experience, immediately drops down next to you. \"Alright, scoot over. I need in on this.\"\n\n Luna obliges, stretching out like she's melting into the pavement, completely and utterly content with the attention she's receiving.\n\n Marky watches with quiet amusement, arms folded loosely over her chest. \"Well,\" she says, \"I guess you've been fully blessed now.\"\n\n You grin, running a hand down Luna's side. \"Feels like it.\"\n\n Luke, still ruffling Luna's fur, looks up at Marky. \"Does this mean we get flower stand VIP status?\"\n\n Marky smirks. \"It means if you buy flowers next time, she might remember you.\"\n\n Luke nods solemnly. \"Challenge accepted.\"\n\n You don't know how long the three of you stay like that, laughing and petting Luna as she soaks up every bit of affection. The afternoon hums around you—people passing by, the scent of flowers drifting in the air, the warmth of the moment settling into your chest like something you want to hold onto.\n\n When you finally stand, brushing stray fur from your clothes and picking up your bouquet, Marky gives you a nod, her expression something softer than just polite kindness. \"Take care of those flowers,\" she says.\n \n You know she means more than just the bouquet.\n\n You nod back. \"I will.\"\n\n \n \n You glance over the flowers again, the vibrant colors mixing in a soft blur. You weren't planning on buying anything, but something about the moment makes you reconsider.\n\n \"...Maybe just a few,\" you finally say. \"I don't need a whole bouquet, but I like the idea of taking something with me.\"\n\n Marky nods as if she expected that answer. She reaches toward the display, her fingers hovering over different flowers before settling on one in particular. She plucks a few delicate, pale-pink blossoms and holds them out to you, their petals soft as silk.\n\n \"These symbolize transformation,\" she says, offering them gently. \"Growth. Stepping into something new, even if you don't know where it'll lead.\"\n\n Your fingers tighten slightly as you take them from her, a strange feeling settling in your chest. She doesn't know about the [referto]—could she?—but somehow, the flowers feel too fitting. Like they were picked for you before you even asked.\n\n You swallow. \"That's a nice meaning.\"\n\n Marky tilts her head, watching you in that way certain people do. \"Yeah,\" she says simply. \"I thought you'd like them.\"\n\n Luna, who had been calmly watching the transaction, lets out a soft huff and shifts slightly on her paws. Without thinking, you reach out, hesitating just slightly before brushing your fingers over the top of her head. She's warm, her fur soft under your touch, but after a few seconds, she pulls back just enough to reclaim her space—not rejecting you, just making it clear that you got a little affection, but no more than you paid for.\n\n You snort. \"She's got rules, huh?\"\n\n Marky chuckles. \"She believes in fairness. Full bouquet? Full pets. A few flowers? A few pats.\"\n\n Luke shakes his head in awe. \"This is an entrepreneurial dog right here.\"\n\n Luna wags her tail once, as if in agreement.\n\n Marky finishes wrapping the stems in a small piece of brown paper, tying it with a simple string before handing them back to you.\n\n \"Take care of them,\" she says.\n\n Something about the way she says it makes the world feel bigger than just flowers.\n\n You nod, tucking them carefully into the crook of your arm. \"I will.\"\n\n Luke, now proudly holding his sunflowers, stretches dramatically. \"Alright. We've got our flowers. We've had our life-changing encounter with Luna. What's next?\"\n\n Marky just smiles, giving a small wave. \"Whatever's next, don't forget to look for the light.\"\n\n And with that, you and Luke step away from the flower stand, the scent of fresh petals lingering in the air, the soft weight of something unexpectedly meaningful resting in your hands.\n\n \n You glance over the flowers, taking in the colors, the way the petals curl slightly at the edges, the careful way each bouquet is wrapped. They're beautiful, and Marky clearly puts a lot of care into them.\n\n But... you weren't really planning on buying anything today. It's not like you need flowers, and as much as Luke is ready to throw his entire wallet at this stand just to stay in Luna's good graces, you're not feeling the same pull.\n\n You shift slightly, rubbing the back of your neck. \"I think I'll pass this time,\" you say, offering a small smile.\n\n Marky nods easily, unfazed. \"No worries. Flowers aren't something you should buy unless you want to.\"\n\n But the moment the words leave your mouth, you feel a distinct shift in the air. A presence. A weight.\n\n Slowly, you glance down.\n\n Luna is staring at you.\n\n Her dark eyes, once full of gentle curiosity, have turned into something far more piercing. There is no aggression, no outright disappointment—just a silent, unimpressed judgment.\n\n You blink.\n\n She huffs.\n\n Then, with great, deliberate effort, Luna shifts her body just enough to turn away from you, placing her chin on her paws with a quiet hmph.\n\n Luke, who was mid-payment for his bouquet, nearly chokes trying to stifle a laugh. \"Dude,\" he wheezes, barely keeping it together. \"She's mad at you.\"\n\n \"I—\" You look at Marky for backup, but she just shrugs, amused.\n\n \"She takes business very seriously,\" she says lightly. \"And you've contributed nothing to the economy.\"\n\n Luke is fully grinning now, clutching his sunflower bouquet like it's the best purchase he's ever made. \"You're dead to her, man. Absolutely dead.\"\n\n You look at Luna again. She does not look at you.\n\n You crouch slightly, trying to get her attention. \"Luna?\"\n\n Nothing.\n\n \"Best dog? Sweetest girl?\"\n\n Luna pointedly does not move.\n\n Luke is beside himself. \"This is the funniest thing that's ever happened to me.\"\n\n You sigh, standing back up. \"Well, I guess I've made an enemy today.\"\n\n \"More like you've been erased from existence, Luke corrects, wiping at his eyes. \"She's rewritten history to forget you were ever here.\"\n\n Marky chuckles, adjusting a ribbon on one of her bouquets. \"She'll get over it,\" she says. \"Probably.\"\n\n \"Probably?!\" you say.\n\n Marky just smiles, clearly enjoying this more than she's letting on.\n\n Luke slaps a hand on your shoulder as he tucks his sunflowers under his arm. \"Well, [name], it's been a pleasure knowing you.\"\n\n You shake your head, accepting your fate. \"Guess I'll see you in another life, Luna.\"\n \n The dog remains unmoved.\n\n With one last laugh from Luke and a small, knowing wave from Marky, the two of you walk away from the stand, leaving behind the gentle scent of flowers and the crushing weight of Luna's disappointment.\n \n\n[Choice: Walk away]",

The town square gradually fades behind you as you take on of the quieter streets, the noise of passing cars and chattering weekend crowds giving way to the rustling of trees and distant calls of seagulls from the bay.\n\nLuke stretches his arms behind his head as you both start up the gentle incline toward one of the best views in town. \"Man,\" he says, exhaling contentedly. \"I think that was the greatest fifteen minutes of my whole life.\"\n\n\"Really?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\"Yes,\" he says, completely serious. \"Dog of the Year and flower wisdom—that's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, [name].\"\n\nYou smirk. \"Well, you did buy flowers. Maybe you should start a new hobby.\"\n\nLuke snorts. \"Right. Because what I need right now is another expensive hobby on top of football and gaming. What am I gonna do, start hand-delivering bouquets after every game?\" He grins, nudging you with his elbow. \"Actually, that'd be kinda cool. Like—boom, victory flowers. Instant romantic points.\"\n\n\"What the hell are you saying?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't get it,\" Luke declares, shoving his hands into his hoodie pocket.\n\nThe two of you continue up the hill, the incline steep enough to feel but not enough to actually slow you down. The buildings of Crestview Bay stretch out below, their rooftops bathed in the golden glow of the setting sun. The sky is shifting now—deepening from soft pastels to richer shades of amber and pink, streaks of violet beginning to thread through the clouds.\n\nLuke kicks a stray pebble as you walk. \"Man, I love this spot. Just high enough to see everything, but not too much effort to get up here.\"\n\nYou nod. The hill has always been a favorite place—one of those quiet spaces where things feel clearer just by being above everything for a while.\n\nLuke glances at you. \"Alright,\" he says, tilting his head. \"You get to pick. What're we talking about on the way up?\"\n\n[Choice: The game on Friday]\n[Choice: The flower stand]\n[Choice: Life and the future]",

      "text": "You and Luke continue your slow climb up the hill, the town stretching out below you in the fading light. The rooftops glow and the bay shimmers, reflecting the warm hues of the sky. The air is crisp but not cold, carrying the scent of grass and saltwater.\n\n \"Alright, let's get this out of the way,\" you say. \"You still thinking about the game?\"\n\n Luke lets out a dramatic groan, tilting his head back like the mere mention of it is exhausting. \"I am trying to move on.\"\n\n \"You're not moving on,\" you point out. \"I saw you running plays in your head at the flower stand.\"\n\n Luke scoffs but doesn't deny it. \"Okay, maybe. But only a little.\" He exhales and shakes his head. \"Man, I swear, that game took, like, ten years off my life.\"\n\n He's not wrong. It had been one of those games that went down to the wire. The Panthers had pulled through, but it hadn't been easy.\n\n \"I mean, you did win,\" you remind him.\n\n \"Yeah, but barely,\" Luke responds. \"I knew Riverview was gonna play dirty, but damn. I still have a bruise from that hit in the third quarter. And don't even get me started on their linebackers. Our defense let them score in the last minute too. If our offense hadn't—\"\n\n \"If,\" you interrupt, smirking. \"But they did.\"\n\n Luke lets out a dramatic sigh, but there's pride in it, too. \"Yeah, say what you want about Jordan, but the guy can throw a pass. The way I caught it too...\" He nods, as if approving of himself. \"It was a miracle.\"\n\n \"You guys deserved it,\" you say, watching him. \"Even if it nearly gave Pacific Crest a heart attack.\"\n\n \"That part was kind of fun,\" Luke laughs. \"The stadium was loud.\"\n\n \"We did do a good job.\"\n\n \"We?\" Luke asks, halting in his tracks. \"Oh, you mean the cheer squad?\"\n\n You roll your eyes. \"Yes, genius.\"\n\n Luke smirks and nudges your shoulder. \"You know I'm not used to seeing you out there yet. I kept looking over and being like, 'Hey, that girl looks kinda like [name].'\"\n\n You scoff. \"It's not that weird.\"\n\n \"It's kinda weird,\" Luke teases. \"But, like... in a good way.\" He pauses, then shrugs. \"You looked like you belonged there.\"\n\n The words sit warm in your chest, a quiet reassurance.\n\n By now, you've reached the top of the hill, the town laid out beneath you in a sprawling view of rooftops, winding streets, and distant lights. The sky has started to shift into deeper shades of orange and pink, the last sliver of the sun disappearing.\n\n Luke lets out a slow breath, planting his feet at the top and looking over the town. \"Damn,\" he says, stretching his arms far above his head. \"You ever just look at this place and realize how small everything is from up here?\"\n\n You take in the view. \"It really puts things in perspective.\"\n\n Luke hums in agreement, watching the horizon. \"Guess that means I should probably stop overthinking the game, huh?\"\n\n You smirk. \"Maybe just a little.\"\n \n \n You and Luke keep climbing, the slope getting a little steeper beneath your feet. The sun is inching lower in the sky, casting a glow over the city. The air is crisp and fresh—one of those perfect autumn days.\n\n \"So,\" you say, breaking the comfortable quiet between you. \"Let's get this out of the way. You still thinking about the game?\"\n\n Luke lets out a short laugh, shaking his head. \"You mean the game? The miracle victory of the Pacific Crest Panthers?\" He spreads his arms dramatically as if reenacting the final play right then and there.\n\n You snort. \"Yeah, that's the one.\"\n\n Luke grins, dropping his arms. \"I mean—I've definitely been replaying it in my head. Just appreciating the moment, you know?\"\n\n You nod, listening.\n\n \"It's weird,\" he continues. \"We've won before, sure, but this one felt different. Everyone was locked in and even the crowd was electric. I swear, I've never heard them that loud before.\"\n\n You resist the urge to cough. Yeah. I wonder why.\n\n Luke keeps going, kicking at a loose rock as he walks. \"It wasn't just us, either. The cheer team was killing it, too. Like, I normally don't even notice, but every time I looked over, they were doing some crazy routine.\"\n\n Oh no.\n\n \"I mean, you saw, right?\" Luke glances at you. \"You were at the game, weren't you.\"\n\n Your brain latches onto the easiest response. \"Uh, yeah.\"\n\n Luke frowns slightly, not convinced. \"Then where were you? Sam and I looked around for you, but we didn't see you anywhere.\"\n\n \"You know, I was around.\"\n\n Luke gives you a rather flat look. \"Around?\"\n\n You wave a hand vaguely. \"Yeah. Just, like, moving around. You know how it is.\"\n\n Luke squints, clearly trying to figure out if that makes sense. You can practically see the gears turning in his head, running through every place you could've been.\n\n \"You weren't sitting with Samantha.\"\n\n \"Nope,\" you say, a little too quickly.\n\n \"You weren't in the front row.\"\n\n \"Nah.\"\n\n \"Or anywhere in the stands, as far as we could tell.\" He tilts his head slightly, eyeing you with suspicion. \"Seriously, dude—where were you?\"\n\n You cough. \"Hey, look, we're almost at the top.\"\n\n Luke looks at you for half a second longer, but then turns around, exhaling through his nose. \"Alright, alright, I'll let it go. For now.\"\n\n Crisis averted.\n\n Just as the conversation settles, the two of you reach the crest of the hill.\n\n The town spreads out below, rooftops bathed in the golden light of the sun. The streets look smaller from up here, winding through the heart of Crestview Bay. You see cafés, bookstores, and the waterfront where the ocean shimmers in the distance. The sky above is streaked with soft oranges and pinks, melting into deepening blues at the edges.\n\n Luke exhales. \"This never gets old, does it?\"\n\n You s hake your head. \"Nope.\"\n\n For a moment, the two of you just stand there, taking it all in—the quiet, the view, and the weight of a day well spent.\n \n \n \n You climb, feeling the slight pull in your legs as the hill steepens. The town below stretches out, the rooftops glowing in the golden light of the setting sun. Luke walks beside you, his pace easy despite the incline, hands shoved into the pocket of his hoodie. His bouquet is tucked under his arm, like he's still not entirely sure what to do with it.\n\n You glance at him, then back at the sky. \"Alright, let's get this out of the way,\" you say. \"You still mad about the game?\"\n\n Luke lets out a slow breath through his nose. \"Hah. Mad?\" He kicks a loose rock ahead of him, watching it tumble down the slope. \"I don't know if 'mad' is the right word. 'Frustrated as all hell' might be more accurate.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I figured.\"\n\n \"You saw the last play, [name],\" he continues, shaking his head. \"I had it. It was right there.\"\n\n You nod. Friday night's game had been brutal—Pacific Crest had fought hard against Riverview, the score neck-and-neck the entire time. And in the final seconds, Luke had been so close to making the game-winning catch. But a defender had knocked the ball loose at the last second, sealing Pacific Crest's loss.\n\n You glance at him. \"You keep replaying it in your head?\"\n\n Luke scoffs. \"Oh, constantly,\" he admits. \"I keep thinking, like—if I had just turned a second faster, if I'd angled my body just right, maybe I could've held onto it.\"\n\n His voice tightens, frustration lanced beneath the words.\n\n \"You know it wasn't just that one play, right?\" you say. \"You guys didn't lose because of you.\"\n\n Luke lets out a sharp exhale, running a hand through his hair. \"I know that. Doesn't mean it doesn't suck.\"\n\n The two of you reach the hill's crest, the world stretching wide beneath you. The sun is low, dipping toward the horizon, casting long shadows over the town. The ocean in the distance reflects back the warm glow, rippling gently under the sky. It's a picturesque view.\n\n Luke stares out over the town. \"It's just... this is our senior year, you know? I wanted us to start strong. And now it feels like we've already screwed up.\"\n\n \"You didn't screw up,\" you say. \"You lost a game. That's not the same thing.\"\n\n Luke huffs. \"Feels like it.\"\n\n You let the silence sit for a few seconds before nudging him with your elbow. \"You do realize there are, like, a ton of games left, right?\"\n\n Luke tilts his head. \"Hmm. No one's ever mentioned this to me before.\"\n\n \"Oh, shut up,\" you say. \"You and I both know one loss doesn't define the season.\"\n\n Luke is quiet for a moment, then sighs. \"Yeah, yeah. I know. I just hate the feeling, you know? Watching the clock run out and knowing you could have changed it but didn't.\"\n\n You glance at him. \"And yet, here you are. Still standing. With a bouquet of sunflowers too.\"\n\n Luke snorts, finally cracking a smile. He lifts the bouquet slightly. \"Well, maybe they'll bring good luck for the next game.\"\n\n \"That, or you can use them to blindside the next defender who tries to block you.\"\n\n He laughs at that. \"Now that's a strategy alright.\"\n\n The two of you stand there for a few seconds, watching as the sun sinks lower.\n\n Luke exhales, rolling his shoulders back. \"Alright,\" he says, more to himself than to you. \"Guess I'll just have to play harder next time.\"\n\n You nod. \"Guess so.\"\n\n For the first time since Friday, he actually sounds like he believes it.\n \n\n \n You and Luke continue up the hill, the flower stand lingering in your thoughts. You glance at Luke, who's still casually swinging his bouquet around like it's a football he doesn't know what to do with. For all his easy confidence, there's something funny about seeing a broad-shouldered football player casually strolling up a hill with a bunch of sunflowers.\n\n \"So,\" you say, eyeing him. \"Be honest. Did you actually want flowers, or was this all just an elaborate excuse to pet the dog?\"\n\n Luke doesn't answer right away. He keeps walking, expression neutral, as if he didn't hear you.\n\n \"Luke,\" you repeat firmly.\n\n Still nothing.\n\n \"Luke.\"\n\n He exhales dramatically, rubbing the back of his neck. \"Okay,\" he admits, dragging the word out. \"Maybe—I might have—initially—been motivated by the dog. At first.\"\n\n You smirk. \"So all that talk about becoming a flower guy—\"\n\n \"Hey,\" he cuts in. \"I'll have you know that was completely real. I have grown as a person. I am now a man of culture and floral appreciation.\"\n\n You snort. \"Oh yeah? Name three flowers that aren't sunflowers or roses.\"\n\n Luke opens his mouth, then immediately closes it. His eyes flicker slightly, like his brain is desperately trying to recall every flower he's ever heard of in his life.\n\n After a second, he clears his throat. \"Dandelions count, right?\"\n\n \"Weeds don't count.\"\n\n \"Orchids?\" he tries.\n\n \"Okay, that's one.\"\n\n \"...Pink ones?\"\n\n You give him a look. \"You are horrible at this.\"\n\n Luke groans, tilting his head back. \"Whatever, man. My relationship with flowers is still in its early stages. We're taking things slow.\"\n\n \"Right, right,\" you say, grinning. \"Wouldn't want to rush into things. Gotta build a solid foundation of trust before you commit.\"\n\n \"Exactly, now you're getting it!\" Luke nods sagely. \"It's all about respect.\"\n\n You shake your head and laugh. Luke glances at the sunflowers again, this time with less hesitation, turning them slightly.\n\n \"...But for real,\" he says, voice a little quieter, \"they're nice.\"\n\n You glance at him.\n\n \"I never really thought about, like... having flowers before. But they make you feel kinda good, y'know.\"\n\n And you do.\n\n Something about the simplicity of it—the reminder that something beautiful can just exist—it does make you feel good.\n\n Luke exhales before grinning again. \"Still, I've got to say that was a ten outta ten experience. Petted an amazing dog, walked away with flowers, made fun of you—perfect day, honestly.\"\n\n You roll your eyes. \"You're lucky Luna liked you. Otherwise, you'd be walking away with nothing.\"\n\n Luke grins, clapping a hand on your shoulder. \"But she did like me. Because dogs recognize greatness.\"\n\n You shove his hand off and laugh.\n\n \n You and Luke keep walking, the path sloping upward beneath your feet. The town stretches out behind you, the last bits of afternoon sunlight painting everything in a golden glow. The sky is shifting, touches of orange and pink appearing.\n\n For a while, neither of you speak. Not because there's nothing to say, but because it's nice—the quiet, the rhythm of walking, the way the breeze carries the scent of sea salt and grass.\n\n Then, without much thought, you ask, \"Do you ever think about where we'll be a year from now?\"\n\n Luke exhales, rubbing the back of his neck. \"Damn, [name]. You're hitting me with the big questions.\"\n\n \"I'm just thinking.\"\n\n Luke falls quiet for a few seconds, staring ahead as the hill keeps climbing. Then, he says, \"Yeah. I think about it a lot, actually.\"\n\n You glance at him. \"Yeah?\"\n\n \"I mean... this is it, right? The last time things are gonna be exactly like this. And I know, everyone says stuff like 'oh, we'll keep in touch, nothing's gonna change,' but...\" He trails off, kicking at a loose pebble in the dirt path. \"I dunno. Sometimes I wonder if that's actually true.\"\n\n Luke keeps going, voice growing quieter. \"Like, you and Sam and me—we've been friends forever. But what happens when we're not all in the same place anymore? What happens when college, or jobs, or whatever else starts pulling us in different directions? Do we just... drift?\"\n\n Luke isn't the kind of person who dwells on the bad outcomes, you know that. He's the it'll work out guy. But right now, there's something unspoken behind his words—the kind of thing he usually brushes off with a joke or a shrug. Like maybe, despite all his usual optimism, a small part of him wonders if things won't stay as easy as they've been until now.\n\n You take some time to think before responding.\n\n \"You know,\" you say after a moment, \"I don't think it's as simple as either staying close or drifting apart.\"\n\n Luke looks at you, brows furrowed.\n\n \"I think... yeah, things will change,\" you admit. \"We won't see each other every day like we do now. We'll have different schedules, different places to be. But that doesn't mean we're just gonna stop being friends, right? Some people stay in your life, no matter how much time passes. And if we want to keep in touch, I think we will.\"\n\n Luke doesn't respond right away. He just looks at you thoughtfully before sighing.\n\n \"Yeah,\" he murmurs. \"I hope so.\"\n\n There's something unspoken in the air—something about him. Friendships have always come pretty naturally to Luke, as effortless as breathing or blinking. But with the future creeping closer, it's like he realizes that things won't stay effortless forever. He doesn't know what that means yet. But at the very least, he knows he wants to hold onto this.\n\n Before you can figure out what to say, the ground levels, and you're suddenly at the top of the hill. The town stretches below, rooftops bathed in gold, the sea in the distance shimmer.\n\n Luke exhales slowly, hands on his hips, staring at the view. \"Man, it's really gonna suck leaving this place.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you admit. \"It is.\"\n\n He's quiet for a moment. Then with a small, almost reluctant smile, he nudges your shoulder. \"I guess that means we should make the most of it while we're here, huh?\"\n\n You nod. \"Yeah. We should.\"\n \n\n[Choice: The hill's crest]",

The winding streets, throbbing with life just a few hours ago, now seem quieter, muted in the evening haze. The remaining daylight sparkles on the glass windows of buildings—turning them into shimmering mirrors reflecting the sky above.\n\nPast the town, the ocean stretches away to the horizon, the surface glimmering with streaks of gold and indigo. The sun is low, a glowing ball of fire descending slowly into the water, its light spilling across the waves. Wisps of pink and lavender clouds stretch lazily across the sky, blending seamlessly into the deepening blue of the approaching night.\n\nTo the west, the cliffs stand in contrast against the sky, their rugged edges glowing in the fading light. The fields below them sway with the breeze, patches of wildflowers dotting the landscape with vibrant color.\n\nAbove, the first stars begin to flicker into existence, delicate pinpricks of silver against a canvas of twilight. The world feels endless from up here—vast, beautiful, and oh so alive.\n\nLuke exhales, hands on his hips as he takes in the view, letting the quiet stretch between you both. Then, after a moment, he nods to himself and says, almost like he's making it official, \"That was a good day.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" you respond, a small smile tugging at your lips. \"It was.\"\n\nNeither of you say much else after that.

You can feel them there, waiting, pressing against the back of your throat, but saying them out loud seems impossible.\n\n Your mom watches you, her expression patient but unwavering. She's waiting for your answer, and you can't tell if that makes it easier or harder.\n\n You inhale, steadying yourself. \"I think I do.\"\n\n Your mom doesn't react right away, so you continue.\n\n \"I don't know if I should like it,\" you admit quietly. \"But I do. At least... parts of it.\"\n\n You shift, letting your gaze fall to the floor. \"At first, it freaked me out. It was all happening so fast, and I—I thought I'd wake up one day and just not recognize myself at all. But the weird thing about all this is that that didn't happen. Every time I looked in the mirror, I still felt like me. That's what scared me the most, it didn't feel wrong.\"\n\n \"It should feel wrong, right?\" you ask, glancing up at her and searching her face. \"I should want to fight this. I should want to fix it. But every time I change, I don't feel like I'm losing myself. If anything, it feels like I'm getting closer to something I never let myself think about before.\"\n\n Your hands tremble.\n\n Your mom doesn't say anything. Not yet. She just listens, her expression softening—not in pity or confusion, but in understanding.\n\n \"I keep thinking about what I was before all this happened. I don't think I was unhappy, but I was... uncomfortable.\" You frown, the pieces clicking together now. \"Like something was always a little off, but I never really knew why. And now? I don't know if this is the answer, but for the first time, I don't feel uncomfortable in my own skin.\"\n\n \"I don't know what the hell that means. I don't know if it means anything. But the idea of just... going back, undoing everything, pretending like none of this ever happened...\" You swallow hard, feeling your throat tighten. \"That scares me more than anything else.\"\n\n You exhale shakily before forcing yourself to meet your mom's gaze again. \"Is that bad?\"\n\n Your mom watches you carefully, her expression softer. She's still searching though, as if she's trying to make sense of everything you've just said.\n\n \"You've been carrying this alone your whole life, haven't you?\" she says quietly.\n\n You don't answer right away. You don't need to. She already knows.\n\n \"Listen,\" she states, sighing. \"I don't care if this is magic, or something else entirely—I just care about you. And if this... if these changes make you feel more like yourself, then that's not a bad thing. You haven't done anything wrong, [name]. There's nothing to apologize for.\"\n\n \"I don't even know what 'myself' means right now,\" you whisper.\n\n \"And you don't have to,\" she says simply. \"Not yet. You'll figure it out at your own pace. And I'll be here, however this shakes out. You know that, right?\"\n\n You nod.\n\n She lets out a quiet sigh, rubbing her temple. \"Alright. We don't have to talk about all of this right now. It's late, and you look exhausted.\"\n\n She gestures toward the hallway. \"Go get some sleep, okay? We can figure this out as we go.\"\n\n Somehow, your mom's words make it easier to breathe.\n\n \n You open your mouth to answer, but the words don't come.\n\n Do you like the way the [referto] is changing you?\n\n You want to say no—that of course you don't, that this is just something happening to you, something out of your control. You want to say you're just trying to get through this, trying to fix it. That's what you should say.\n\n But that isn't the truth.\n\n \"I... don't know,\" you admit, voice quieter than you intended. You swallow, looking down at your hands. \"I really don't know.\"\n\n Your mom doesn't interrupt. She just lets you speak.\n\n You take a shaky breath. \"I mean, it's weird. Something always feels different. Some of it's small, barely noticeable. Some of it's—not.\" Your fingers twitch slightly. \"And I keep telling myself that I should hate it. That I should be fighting against it. But then I catch myself in the mirror and I just—\"\n\n You hesitate, searching for the right words. \"—I don't know how to feel about it.\"\n\n Your mom stays quiet, but she's listening.\n\n \"It's like... part of me wants to hate it,\" you continue, your voice uneven. \"Because if I do hate it, then there's no question, right? If I hate it, then I have to stop it. I should be looking for a way to fix it. That would make everything simple. But it's not simple. It's confusing. It's frustrating. And the worst part is sometimes, I'll catch myself thinking... what if this isn't a bad thing?\"\n\n Saying it out loud makes your stomach twist.\n\n \"I don't know what that means,\" you admit. \"I don't know if my brain is just trying to make sense out of an impossible situation, or if this is something I've always felt and I just never let myself think about it before. And I don't even know if I want to know.\" You shake your head, exhaling. \"I just don't know.\"\n\n You finally look back up at your mom but she hasn't moved. She slowly leans forward, resting her elbows on her knees. And without hesitation, she reaches out, placing a steady hand over yours.\n\n \"You don't have to have all the answers right now,\" she says, voice low but firm. \"You don't have to figure this all tonight. Or tomorrow. Or even next week.\" She squeezes your hand gently. \"You just have to give yourself permission to feel what you feel. And no matter what that ends up being... I'm here. I will always be here.\"\n\n You've been struggling for two weeks. You've been unsure of what to say, unsure if saying anything would even help. But now, sitting here in the dim glow of the living room, your mom's hand steady over yours, you feel something loosen inside you.\n\n After a moment, she lets out a small sigh. \"You must be exhausted.\"\n\n You nod, because yeah. You are exhausted.\n\n She gives your hand one last squeeze before finally letting go, her voice still quiet when she says. \"Go get some sleep, sweetheart.\"\n\n As you stand and quietly make your way to your room, you can still feel your mom's gaze lingering on you. She's making sure you know she's here.\n\n \n \n \n Your breath catches in your throat.\n\n For a moment, you can't say anything. The words get stuck, heavy, tangled, and unwilling to come out. You want to ignore the question—to pretend you didn't hear it, to pretend you don't have to answer. But your mom is sitting there and waiting with that unrelenting patience she always has when she knows you're holding something back.\n\n You let yourself be completely honest.\n\n \"No.\" Your voice comes out rough, like it hurts to say it. \"I don't like it. I just want to be me again.\"\n\n Your mom doesn't react right away. She doesn't rush in with reassurances, doesn't tell you you're wrong, doesn't try to force you into seeing things differently. She just listens.\n\n So you keep going.\n\n \"I didn't ask for this,\" you murmur. \"I didn't do anything to deserve it. And now every time I do something—anything—it feels like I'm walking on a tightrope, like I have to be careful about how I move, how I act, and what I say because I don't know what's going to happen next. I feel like I'm slipping away from myself, and I don't know how to stop it.\"\n\n Your voice cracks slightly at the end, but you don't bother trying to cover it up.\n\n Your mom's expression shifts. A flicker of something deep and aching in her eyes, like it physically hurts her to hear you say that.\n\n She leans forward, resting her elbows on her knees. \"[name],\" she whispers. \"Why didn't you tell me sooner?\"\n\n You let out a humorless laugh. \"What was I supposed to say? 'Hey Mom, I'm cursed and turning into a girl and it's super terrifying'?\"\n\n \"Yes,\" she says without any hesitation. \"Because that's something I should know.\"\n\n You shake your head, looking away. \"I thought I could handle it. That if I just ignored it, maybe it would go away. But it's not going away. And I—I don't want this. I don't want to change anymore. I just want to be me again.\"\n\n Silence settles between you.\n\n Your mom exhales and rubs her hands together as she processes everything you've just said. She doesn't rush to fill the quiet—she just sits with it, with you, letting the weight of it all settle.\n\n \"Okay,\" she finally says. She leans forward, resting her elbows on her knees, studying you with that same unwavering gaze. \"We'll figure it out. But not tonight. Go get some rest, [name]. We'll talk more about this later.\"\n\n Your mom watches you for a little longer before standing up and heading toward the hallway. She pauses just before she disappears around the corner, glancing back at you. \"I love you, son.\"\n\n You manage a small nod.\n \n\n[Choice: Bedtime]",

      "text": "For a moment, you consider lying. Telling your mom that she's imagining things. But looking at her now—at the quiet determination in her eyes, the way she's bracing herself for whatever you're about to say—you realize there's no avoiding this.\n\n So you exhale, steading yourself.\n\n \"Mom...\" Your voice comes out quieter than you intended, like it's resisting the weight of the words. \"Something happened to me.\"\n\n Your mom doesn't move, but you can see the way her shoulders tense, how she holds her breath as she waits.\n\n \"I don't know how to explain it,\" you continue. \"I don't even know where to start, but... it's real.\" You gesture vaguely at yourself, at your softer features. \"This isn't just some weird phase. It's not hormones or diet or—I don't know—something explainable. It's real. And I don't know how to stop it.\"\n\n Your mom's brows furrow, concern settling deeper into her expression. \"What do you mean, you don't know how to stop it?\"\n\n \"It started at the Autumn Festival,\" you admit. \"Two weeks go. When I passed out. Someone put a [referto] on me.\"\n\n Your mom blinks. \"A [referto]?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, letting out an awkward chuckle. \"I know how it sounds. But I swear I'm not lying. The fortune teller there did something to me. She looked right at me, said something cryptic about the 'mirror revealing my truth,' and ever since then...\" You gesture at yourself again. \"Every time I do anything remotely feminine, I change a little more.\"\n\n Your mom doesn't react immediately. She just stares at you, her expression unreadable.\n\n You feel the silence settle between you, thick and heavy. Your heart pounds. You're not sure what you expected, but she's just taking in everything you've just said.\n\n And then, finally, she exhales. \"You're serious.\"\n\n You nod. \"Yeah.\"\n\n She leans back in her chair, rubbing her temples. \"A [referto],\" she murmurs, more to herself than to you. \"This is actually happening.\"\n\n You shift on your feet. \"You don't believe me.\"\n\n She looks up immediately. \"I believe you.\" The certainty in her voice catches you off guard. \"I'll admit I don't know if I understand it yet, but I believe you.\"\n\n That makes your chest feel lighter.\n\n Your mom exhales again, shaking her head slightly like she's trying to wrap her mind around it. \"And you waited two weeks to tell me?\" she asks, gaze sharpening.\n\n You wince. \"I mean, what was I supposed to say?\" you ask, trying to justify yourself. \"'Hey, Mom, I got magically cursed and now I'm changing?'\"\n\n She gives you a look, one that clearly says that would've been preferable.\n\n You sigh. \"I was scared. And I—I didn't know how to explain it. I still don't.\"\n\n She studies you again, something unreadable in her gaze. Then, finally, she nods. \"Alright,\" she says. \"Alright. What do we do now?\"\n\n [Choice: I need help figuring this out]\n [Choice: I don't know... but I'll handle it]\n [Choice: I just needed you to know]\n\n \n \n Your pulse hammers against your ribs. The weight of her gaze is unbearable—too sharp, too knowing. You can't tell her. You can't.\n\n So you do the only thing you can think of. You deflect.\n\n \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" you say, forcing a tired sigh as you shift your weight. \"I'm just tired.\"\n\n Your voice comes out steady—casual, even. You keep your expression neutral and your posture loose, like none of this is a big deal. Like you don't notice what she's noticing. Like there's nothing to notice at all.\n\n But your mom doesn't buy it.\n\n She doesn't even blink, holding eye contact. The room stays heavy with unsaid words. She isn't angry—she never gets angry over things like this—but the concern in her face deepens.\n\n \"[name],\" she says again, softer this time. \"This isn't just you being tired.\"\n\n You shake your head. \"Mom, seriously, I'm fine. It's just school. Stress building up. You know how it is.\"\n\n She exhales slowly and presses her lips together. \"Stress doesn't change the way a person looks.\"\n\n The last part cuts through the air like a blade. You clench your jaw, suddenly hyperaware of every inch of yourself—your softened features and the androgynous way you stand in the dim light.\n\n She sees it.\n\n She's waiting for you to give her something that makes sense. And for a moment, just a brief one, you think she might let it go.\n\n But then, she tilts her head and watches you in that way only moms can. \"If you're fine,\" she states slowly, \"then look me in the eye and tell me nothing is wrong.\"\n\n Your breath catches.\n\n She's backing you into a corner where you'll have to either double down and tell her the truth.\n\n Or you could say something else. Something that doesn't tell the whole truth, but at least keeps you from outright lying.\n\n Or maybe... you should just walk away.\n\n [Choice: Look her in the eye and lie]\n [Choice: Give her half the truth]\n [Choice: End the conversation]\n\n \n \n Your heartbeat feels too loud in your chest as every muscle in your body tenses like a coiled spring.\n\n \"Why are you making this such a big deal?\" you spit out. \"I'm fine.\"\n\n The words come out sharper than you intended, but you don't back down. You ''can't''. If you let this conversation happen, you don't know what's going to come out.\n\n Your mom's brows knit together, and for a second, she just watches you. Not in an accusatory way, not angry, but in that piercing way only a mother can.\n\n \"[name],\" she says carefully, \"you are not fine.\"\n\n You exhale sharply, shaking your head. \"Mom, come on—\"\n\n \"Don't do that,\" she cuts in, leaning forward slightly. \"Don't try and brush this off like it's nothing. Like I don't see you.\"\n\n You clench your jaw and look away.\n\n \"I know you,\" she continues, tone unwavering. \"I know how you stand, how you walk, how your face looks in the morning, how your voice sounds when you're lying. And I know when you're trying to push me away.\"\n\n She exhales. \"I need you to talk to me.\"\n\n But you don't listen.\n \n You shake your head, frustration bubbling over. \"Mom, like I said, there's nothing to talk about!\" You gesture vaguely at yourself, at the room, at everything. \"I don't get why you're acting like this is some huge emergency. I'm fine, I'm just—\"\n\n You falter, realizing that you don't even have a decent lie to follow that up with.\n\n Your mom doesn't flinch, doesn't look away. \"No one changes like this overnight, [name]. And I know you know that.\"\n\n The lump in your throat feels heavier now, like it's trying to choke you from the inside out.\n\n \"You don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\n The words snap out of you before you can stop them, harsher than you meant, but you don't take them back. If you start letting her in now—if you crack, even for a second—you don't know what's going to spill out.\n\n Your mom's expression doesn't change. You almost wish she would get angry, that she would yell back. That would be easier. You know how to handle anger. But this? This quiet, steady insistence? The way she looks at you, not with judgment, but with concern—like she already knows something is deeply wrong, and she won't let you pretend otherwise?\n\n It's unbearable.\n\n \"I do know what I'm talking about,\" she says, unyielding. \"I know my child. And I know when he's lying to me.\"\n\n You grit your teeth, fists clenched at your sides. \"I'm not lying.\"\n\n She shakes her head. \"Then explain it. Explain why you look different. Do you think I wouldn't notice? That I wouldn't see how much you've changed?\"\n\n \"I haven't changed!\"\n\n The words burst out of you, too fast, too desperate, and for the first time, your mom's face shifts—just slightly, just enough for something to flicker behind her eyes.\n\n You realize, too late, that you've already lost.\n\n Because you have changed. And you both know it.\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n Your chest rises and falls with shallow breaths, anger and panic twisting together into something messy. It's not fair. None of this is fair. You didn't ask for this, but some part of you wonders if you did—if maybe, deep down, you've always been walking toward this without realizing it. And now you're standing here, caught in the open, having to face questions you're not even sure you're ready to ask yourself—let alone answer for someone else.\n \n \n Your chest rises and falls with shallow breaths, anger and panic twisting together into something messy. It's not fair. None of this is fair. You didn't ask for this, you didn't want this, and now, somehow, you're standing there, having to justify your own existence to someone who's supposed to just accept it.\n \n \n She doesn't look away. \"[name].\"\n\n Her voice is softer now, but that doesn't help. It only makes you feel worse.\n\n \"You're acting like I've done something wrong,\" you mutter, jaw tight. \"Like I—like I'm some problem that has to be fixed.\"\n\n Your mom's expression twists into something close to pain. \"That's not what this is.\"\n\n \"Then what is it?\"\n\n She hesitates. Not because she doesn't know, but because she's choosing her words carefully.\n\n Finally, she exhales. \"I just want to understand.\"\n\n You know she means it. You can tell. She's not accusing you or trying to control you. She's worried. And for all your frustration, all your defensiveness, some part of you know that's not unreasonable.\n\n But that doesn't mean you're ready to talk.\n <!-- Day 14 Mom Notice X Choice 1 -->\n [Choice: Dig in your heels]\n [Choice: Let some anger slip]\n [Choice: Give her something]",

      "text": "You take a deep breath, steadying yourself. \"I need help figuring this out.\"\n\n Your mom watches you carefully before nodding. \"Okay.\"\n\n It's such a simple word, but something in your chest loosens at hearing it.\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n \"I don't even know where to start,\" you admit, running a hand through your hair. \"I've been trying to handle it on my own, but the more things change, the harder it is to ignore. And the thing is... I don't know if I want it to stop. But I don't know where it's leading either, and that scares me as well.\"\n \n \n \"I don't even know where to start,\" you admit. \"I've been trying to just—deal with it on my own. But the more time passes, the harder that gets. I don't know if this is going to stop or if it's just going to go until I don't even recognize myself anymore.\"\n \n \n Your voice wavers at the end, but you push through it.\n\n Your mom presses her lips together, her brows furrowing slightly.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says, voice firm. \"First things first—you don't have to do this alone. I don't care what kind of magic this is, we're going to figure it out together.\"\n\n The word together sticks with you.\n\n \"You said this started at the Autumn Festival?\" she asks.\n\n You nod. \"Yeah. Madame Serena cursed me after I recorded her. And things started changing after that.\"\n\n \"We'll look at every possibility,\" your mom declares. \"If there's a way to stop this, to help you, we'll find it.\"\n\n You hadn't realized how much you needed to hear that.\n\n She exhales sitting back slightly. \"You're exhausted,\" she says, matter-of-factly. \"We can talk more in the morning. But [name]—\" Her voice softens. \"Don't keep things like this from me again. I know you didn't want me to worry, but that's not how this works. No matter what happens, I want to know.\"\n\n You nod. \"Okay.\"\n\n She watches you for another moment before letting out a small sigh. \"Alright,\" she murmurs. \"Go get some sleep.\"\n\n You walk to your room feeling a little less alone in all this.\n \n \n You swallow as the weight of your mom's gaze presses against you, full of concern and worry.\n\n But the truth is, you don't know what to do. And you're not sure if she can help, even if she wants to.\n\n You exhale slowly. \"I don't know,\" you admit. \"But I'll handle it.\"\n\n Your mom sits up straighter. \"[name]—\"\n\n \"I mean it,\" you cut in gently. \"I've been dealing with it on my own until now. It's weird, yeah, but I am handling it.\" You hesitate, then add, \"I didn't want you to worry. That's why I didn't tell you.\"\n\n She lets out a breath that's a mix of exasperation and disbelief. \"[name]—you tell me now, after two weeks, and you don't want me to worry?\"\n\n You awkwardly rub the back of your neck. \"That was kind of a dumb thing to do, huh?\"\n\n \"I am worried,\" your mom says, shaking her head. \"You don't have to pretend this isn't a big deal just to make me feel better.\"\n\n You shift on your feet, unsure how to respond.\n\n She watches you a little longer before leaning back in her chair and crossing her arms. \"Alright,\" she says, her voice calmer but no less serious. \"if you say you've got it handled, I won't push. But I am going to ask questions. And if you need help...\"\n\n \"I know,\" you say.\n\n \"Good,\" she nods.\n\n The conversation lingers between you for a moment, heavy but settled. It's not perfect and you can tell she wants to do more, but she's choosing to trust you.\n\n \"Go get some sleep, [name],\" she says, rubbing her temples.\n\n You nod. \"Night, Mom.\"\n\n You turn toward the stairs, then, finally, just as you reach the hallway, you hear her murmur:\n\n \"Goodnight, sweetheart.\"\n\n You pause, just for a second, then keep walking.\n\n The house is quiet again, but it feels much lighter than before.\n \n \n Your mom's question hangs in the air, waiting—What do we do now?\n\n The weight of everything presses against your chest as you shift on your feet. You could ask for help. You could try to figure out a plan. But right now, that's not what you need.\n\n \"Honestly, I just needed you to know,\" you say.\n\n Her expression softens. She exhales slowly, absorbing your words, before nodding.\n\n \"Okay,\" she says.\n\n You let out a breath of relief.\n\n \"You look exhausted,\" she murmurs. \"Go get some sleep.\"\n\n She's not dismissing you. She just wants to make sure she doesn't overwhelm you.\n\n You nod, the exhaustion catching up to you all at once. \"Yeah... okay.\"\n\n You move toward the stairs, but as you're about to start climbing, your mom speaks again—softer this time.\n\n \"[name]?\"\n\n You pause, turning back.\n\n \"I love you.\"\n\n You swallow. \"I know.\"\n\n And then, without another word, you head upstairs.\n\n The house is still quiet, but it doesn't feel so heavy anymore. The weight of your secret has finally been set down—at least a little.\n\n You step into your room, close the door behind you, and let yourself breathe.\n \n\n \n \n \n You meet her eyes, steady and unwavering, and force the words out as smoothly as you can.\n\n \"Nothing's wrong.\"\n\n The lie sits heavy on your tongue, but you don't let it show. You keep everything perfectly controlled. You've lied before, but this is different. This isn't a little lie. This is a wall, built brick by brick between you and the truth.\n\n Your mom studies you. For a few unbearable seconds, she says nothing.\n\n Then, slowly, she exhales, leaning back in her chair. \"Alright.\"\n\n You almost don't believe she's letting it go.\n\n But then she crosses her arms. \"If you say nothing's wrong, I'll believe you. But you should know something, [name].\"\n\n She doesn't sound angry or even frustrated. Just... tired.\n\n \"I don't care what it is. I really don't. If you need help, if something is happening to you—you can tell me.\"\n\n Her voice is quiet but firm, carrying a certainty she's always had, the kind that makes it clear that no matter what's going on, she wants to be on your side.\n\n \"I know,\" you say.\n\n She studies you for another second, like she's waiting for something else. But you don't give her anything.\n\n Finally, she stands up. \"Go get some sleep. We'll talk later.\"\n\n It's not a win. You haven't convinced her—just bought yourself some time. She's still watching, still waiting. But for now, the conversation is over.\n\n You nod, murmuring a quick goodbye before heading toward your room, your lie weighing heavily on your shoulders.\n \n \n You hesitate.\n\n Lying outright won't work. Not with your mom. She knows you too well, sees through you too easily. But telling her the whole truth? About magic, about the [referto], about how you transform every time you do something feminine? That's not an option either.\n\n So you settle for something in between.\n\n You exhale, letting your gaze flicker toward the floor before you force yourself to meet her eyes. \"it's just... I've been changing a little,\" you admit, keeping your voice careful. \"I don't know why.\"\n\n Your mom's expression doesn't shift right away. She stays still, studying you, weighing your words like she's trying to decide whether to believe them. Whether to believe you.\n\n \"You don't know why,\" she repeats.\n\n You shake your head. \"I swear, Mom, I don't. I've just been feeling weird. And, yeah, I guess I look different, but it's not like I planned for it to happen.\"\n\n That part, at the very least, is true. You didn't plan for any of this.\n\n Your mom exhales, her arms unfolding just slightly. The sharpness in her posture softens. \"[name],\" she says gently, \"if something's wrong, if you're feeling off, you need to tell me. We can figure it out together.\"\n\n You swallow. \"I know.\"\n\n She watches you for another long moment, her lips pressing into a thin line. \"Okay then,\" she says finally. \"I'm not going to push you. Not tonight.\"\n\n Relief washes over you, but it doesn't last long.\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n \"But this conversation isn't over,\" she continues firmly. \"I don't know what's going on, and apparently, neither do you. But you don't have to deal with it alone. Whatever this is, you're still my child. That's not going to change.\"\n \n \n \"But this conversation isn't over,\" she continues firmly. \"I don't know what's going on, and apparently, neither do you. But you don't have to deal with it alone. Whatever this is, you're still my son. That's not going to change.\"\n \n\n You nod. \"I get it.\"\n\n For a second, it looks like she might say more, might press just a little further. But then, she sighs, rubbing at her temple. \"Alright,\" she murmurs. \"Go get some sleep. We'll talk more later.\"\n\n You don't argue. You just nod again, turning toward the stairs.\n\n As you make your way up, the conversation lingers in your head. She didn't push much, but it's clear that she's not letting it go. You know that sooner or later, you're going to have to figure out how much of the truth you're willing to tell.\n \n \n \n The air in the room feels heavy. Your mom is still watching you, waiting—expecting something. But you don't have an answer she'll believe. Not one that makes sense. Not one you're willing to give.\n\n So you shut it down.\n\n \"I don't want to talk about this.\"\n\n Your voice is steady, but there's an edge to it, sharper than you intended. You don't mean for it to sound harsh, but it does.\n\n Your mom straightens slightly, her expression unreadable. For a second, you think she's going to push again—press until you have to give her something—but she doesn't. Instead, she exhales, slow and measured, and nods once.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says.\n\n That's it. No argument, no lecture, no demands.\n\n Just alright.\n\n But the way she says it makes something twist in your chest.\n\n You walk toward the stairs, and your mom lets you. As you reach the steps, you hear her shift in her chair, settling back into the dimly lit silence of the living room. The house is still quiet, but now it feels different—heavier. Like something important just slipped through the cracks.\n\n And you're not sure if that's a good thing or not.\n \n\n \n \n \n Your mom is still looking at you, waiting—maybe even hoping—that you'll give her something.\n\n But you won't.\n\n \"There's nothing to understand. Just drop it.\"\n\n The words come out cold, clipped, final.\n\n Your mom's lips part slightly, like she wants to argue, to reach for something that might make you listen. But then, just as quickly, she presses them into a thin line. Her expression shifts, the concern in her eyes dimming. It gets replaced with something smaller. Something hurt.\n\n She looks at you for another moment, searching, as if she's trying to find the version of you she recognizes—the one she's always known. But whatever she sees now, it isn't enough.\n\n Slowly, she exhales, then leans back in her chair. Her posture isn't tense anymore and it's clear she's no longer ready to fight you on this.\n\n \"...Alright,\" she murmurs, voice barely above a whisper. \"If that's how you want it.\"\n\n It should feel like a victory.\n\n But it doesn't.\n\n It feels like the space between you just got wider, like the house itself suddenly feels emptier.\n\n She doesn't say anything else. Doesn't tell you goodnight and to stay warm. She just sits there, looking down at her hands in her lap, expression unreadable.\n\n You swallow hard, your throat dry, your heart pounding uncomfortably in your chest.\n\n You could say something. You could take it back. But instead, you turn toward the stairs, leaving the room.\n\n As you ascend, the weight of your mom's unsaid words follow you, lingering in the air around you.\n \n \n \n Your whole body feels tense, like a live wire ready to snap. Your mom is still looking at you—waiting, expecting—like there's some right answer you're supposed to give. Like she just needs you to let her in, and everything will be fine.\n\n But it's not fine.\n\n \"I don't want to talk about it, okay?\"\n\n The words come out hard, sharp, and edged with something close to desperation. Louder than you meant. More forceful than you wanted.\n\n Your mom flinches—not dramatically, but enough. Just enough for you to see it.\n\n She recovers quickly, schooling her expression, but the hurt is still there. Her lips press together, and she sits back slightly, hands tightening where they rest on her arms.\n\n For a moment, neither of you say anything.\n\n You exhale harshly, turning away, your pulse still hammering at your temples. You don't even want to see how she reacts, don't want to deal with the look that'll be in her eyes.\n\n The silence stretches for far too long.\n\n Finally, your mom exhales, slow and measured. \"Okay.\"\n\n Not angry, but resigned.\n\n \"Okay,\" she repeats, and something about the way she says it makes your stomach twist.\n\n You don't turn around.\n\n \"You should get some sleep,\" she says, her voice steadier now, like she's forcing herself back into control. \"We'll talk later.\"\n\n You nod stiffly, not trusting yourself to speak.\n\n And just like that, the conversation is over.\n\n You move toward the stairs, bouquet still clenched tightly in your hands. You can feel her watching you as you go, like she wants to say something, like she wants to reach for you, but doesn't.\n\n You don't stop. You don't look back.\n\n The moment you step into your room and close the door behind you, you let out a breath you didn't realize you were holding.\n\n Your chest is tight and your hands are shaking.\n\n You got out of that conversation, sure, but it doesn't feel like a win.\n \n\n Your heart still pounds in your chest, every instinct telling you to push back harder, to shut this down completely. To keep this yours.\n\n But your mom isn't fighting you. She isn't demanding anything. She's just waiting patiently for you to tell her the answer to all her questions.\n\n You swallow hard, staring at the floor, and after a long moment, you force out the words before you can stop yourself.\n\n \"I... I don't know how to explain it.\"\n\n It's not the full truth, sure, but it's not a lie either. It's all you can give her right now.\n\n Your mom exhales slowly, like she's letting go of something she was holding onto too tightly. When you finally look up at her, her expression has softened, but there's still something in her eyes—something tired and hurt. Not because she's angry, but because she knows you're keeping something from her.\n\n How can she help if you won't let her in?\n\n But she nods, just once. Accepting the little you're willing to offer.\n\n \"Okay,\" she says, relenting. \"I won't push you.\"\n\n You feel a knot of tension unravel in your chest.\n\n \"But,\" she continues, her gaze steady, \"you know you can talk to me, right? About anything?\"\n\n You hesitate. Then finally, you nod. You don't know if you mean it, but it's what she needs to hear right now.\n\n She studies you a little longer, searching for something in your face that you're not sure she finds, then leans back in her chair with a sigh. \"Go get some sleep, [name].\"\n\n Relief crashes over you like a wave. You don't say anything else, opting to just turn and make your way upstairs.\n \n As you close your bedroom door, you let out a breath you didn't realize you were holding.\n\n For now, the conversation is over. But you know this isn't the last time you'll have it.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Bedtime]",

      "text": "Your first instinct is to deflect, to brush it off, to say it's nothing—but looking at your mom now, you know that won't work. She knows something is wrong and is worried.\n\n You sigh, rubbing a hand over your face. \"You're right.\" The words come out quieter than you expected. \"Something else is going on.\"\n\n Your mom doesn't look relieved—if anything, her expression tightens, like she's bracing for whatever comes next. \"Alright,\" she says. \"So talk to me.\"\n\n You hesitate, pulse picking up. You can't tell her everything, not yet. But you can tell her something.\n\n \"It's just...\" You exhale, looking down at your hands. \"I've been dealing with something. And I didn't know how to tell you, so I didn't. I figured I could handle it on my own, but it's been harder than I thought.\"\n\n Her brows furrow, concern setting deep into her features. \"[name],\" she says, gentler now. \"You know you don't have to handle things alone, right?\"\n\n You nod automatically, your mind answering before your mind catches up. You do know that. And yet, for the past two weeks, you've been trying to do things by yourself.\n\n Your mom studies you carefully, debating whether to push for more. But then she sighs, shaking her head. \"Alright. You don't have to tell me everything right now. But you do need to promise me something.\"\n\n You glance up. \"What?\"\n\n Her voice is steady. \"Don't shut me out. Whatever this is—whatever you're dealing with—I don't want to find out two weeks from now that it's gotten worse. You don't have to tell me everything right now, but when you're ready... Please let me help.\"\n\n You nod.\n\n She watches you a little longer before sitting back in her chair, some of the tension in her shoulders easing. \"Alright.\" A small sigh. \"Go get some rest. We'll talk more when you're ready.\"\n\n As you head to your room, you know one thing for sure:\n\n She is not going to stop paying attention.\n\n \n \n You force yourself to shrug, keeping a neutral expression. \"I've just been busy, I guess.\"\n\n Your mom doesn't look convinced. if anything, her frown deepens. \"Busy?\" she repeats like she's testing the word out.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, trying to make it sound casual. \"School, friends, just... stuff. I didn't think I needed to check in with you all the time.\"\n\n Your mom exhales slowly, pressing her lips together. She is not buying it.\n\n \"[name],\" she says, voice level but firm. \"I know you. And I know when you're keeping something from me.\"\n\n You keep your face as blank as possible.\n\n She studies for you, searching for a crack. For a second, you think she might push harder, press until she forces the truth out of you.\n\n But then, finally, she exhales and sits back. \"Fine,\" she states. \"If you don't want to talk, I won't make you. But I'm not stupid, [name]. And I'm not going to stop paying attention.\"\n\n That makes your stomach twist.\n\n She lets the words hang in the air for a little longer before pushing herself up from the chair. \"Go get some sleep,\" she says quietly. \"You look like you need it.\"\n\n And with that, she walks past you, leaving the conversation unfinished.\n\n \n \n Your jaw tightens. \"Why do you suddenly care where I go.\"\n\n Your mom's expression doesn't change, but something sharpens in her eyes. \"Don't say that.\" Her voice is calm, but there's an edge to it now—one that makes it clear she's not going to let you push her away that easily. \"You know I care. I always care.\"\n\n \"Then why are you acting like I've done something wrong?\" you snap.\n\n \"Because you won't talk to me!\" she says, frustration creeping into her voice. \"You disappear for hours, avoid me when you're home, and I'm supposed to just not ask questions?\"\n\n \"It's not like you ever cared before,\" you mutter.\n\n \"Excuse me?\"\n\n You regret the words the second they escape your lips, but it's too late to take them back. Your mom straightens slightly.\n\n \"I always care, [name],\" she says. \"Always. But I also know when to give you space. And for the last two weeks, I've been trying to let you come to me on your own. But you haven't. And I'm done waiting.\"\n\n You don't respond. You opt to look away, jaw clenched.\n\n For a moment, it's dead silent. The air between you is heavy—thick with unspoken words.\n\n Finally, your mom sighs, rubbing a hand down her face. \"Fine,\" she says. \"I won't force you to talk if you don't want to. But don't pretend I don't care. And don't think for a second that I'm just going to stop noticing when something's wrong.\"\n\n She pushes herself up from the chair, watches you for a moment, and then walks past you.\n\n A door clicks shut down the hall.\n\n You sit there, staring at the empty space she left behind, the house silent around you.\n \n\n[Choice: Bedtime]",

      "text": "Day 14 Vincent Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \nThe walk to Crestview Bay Public Library is peaceful, the Sunday afternoon air cool and breezy. The part of town with the library is still, like it belongs to another time entirely. The buildings are older, brick facades worn but well-kept, and the streetlamps flicker faintly in the early evening light.\n\nThe library isn't exactly the most exciting way to spend an afternoon, but when Vincent asked if you wanted to go, something about the way he worded it—hesitant but hopeful—made it hard to say no.\n\nThe entrance doors creak slightly as you step inside, the faint hum of the air conditioning mixing with the occasional rustle of pages and muffled whispers. The front desk librarian gives you a polite nod, not bothering to ask if you need help. People don't usually come here unless they know exactly what they're looking for.\n\nYou scan the area, looking for Vincent.\n\nHe hadn't given you a lot of details in his text—just that he'd be here, something about checking out a new book that just came in. Typical Vincent. Always wrapped up in a book, always eager to share whatever obscure fact or literary analysis was currently taking up space in his brain.\n\nIt doesn't take long for you to spot him.\n\nHe's sitting near the back of the library, tucked away at a small wooden table between two towering shelves. His posture is hunched slightly, completely absorbed in the book in front of him, his fingers twitching faintly as he absentmindedly traces the edges of the page. A half-finished iced coffee sits to his left and a stack of neatly arranged notes sits to his right. His backpack—overstuffed with papers, pens, and probably even more books—rests against the leg of his chair.\n\nVincent doesn't notice you at first. His eyes flick rapidly across the page, his lips parted slightly like he's on the verge of whispering the words to himself. Every so often, he reaches for his pen and jots something down in the notebook beside him, his handwriting neat and precise, like he's organizing his thoughts mid-sentence.\n\nYou hesitate for a second, watching him. There's something endearing about how completely lost in his own world he is, like nothing outside of this moment exists. His foot bounces under the table in that absentminded way people do when they're fully engrossed in something.\n\nAnd the best part is he hasn't noticed you at all.\n\nYou stand there for a moment, debating how to get his attention. If you say something too loud, he might jump. If you touch his shoulder, he might actually die from shock. If you wait too long, though, you'll just look like some weirdo hovering over him in the middle of the library.\n\nYeah, you should probably say something.\n\n[Choice: Say something light and playful]\n[Choice: Say something curious and direct]\n[Choice: Say something dramatic and over-the-top]",

      "text": "\"Vincent. Earth to Vincent,\" you say, keeping your voice just loud enough to be heard but quiet enough not to earn a glare from the librarian. \"Are you trapped inside that book, or can you still hear human voices?\"\n\n Vincent startles so hard that he nearly knocks over his iced coffee. His pen slips from his fingers, clattering against the notebook, and his head snaps up, eyes wide behind his glasses. For a second, he just stares at you, like he's still mentally clawing his way out of whatever literary abyss he was lost in.\n\n Then, recognition flickers across his face. His shoulders relax—just slightly—and he lets out a breathy, nervous laugh. \"Oh. Oh. [name]. Hey.\" He quickly straightens his glasses, pushing them up the bridge of his nose as if that'll somehow make him look less completely caught off guard.\n\n \"You looked like you were about five seconds away from merging with the page,\" you tease, sliding into the seat next to him.\n\n Vincent huffs, clearly flustered, and quickly flips his book closed, revealing the title: East of Eden.\n\n You glance at it, raising an eyebrow. \"That's uh—Steinbeck, right?\"\n\n Vincent nods, still looking a little embarrassed at being caught so engrossed. \"Yeah. One of his big ones. Kind of a huge one, actually.\" He taps his fingers against the book's worn cover, his voice picking up a little. \"It's this sprawling, multi-generational story about family and good and evil and—just—everything, really.\"\n\n You smirk. \"That's not vague at all.\"\n\n Vincent laughs under his breath, shaking his head. \"I know, I know. It's just hard to sum up in a couple of sentences. It's got biblical references, big moral dilemmas, super flawed characters—it's messy, but in the best way. It feels real, you know?\"\n\n You don't, not really—you haven't read it. But you can tell by the way he talks about it, the way his fingers linger on the cover, that it means something to him.\n\n \"I mean, I'll take your word for it,\" you say, leaning on the table. \"I don't think I've ever seen you not reading something, though. What makes this one stand out?\"\n\n Vincent hesitates, like he's not sure how much to say. His foot taps lightly under the table. \"I guess... I just like the idea that people can choose to be good or bad. That you're not just born a certain way. You get to decide.\" His voice is quieter now. \"Not every book really says that, you know?\"\n\n You nod slowly, letting that sit between you for a moment.\n\n \"So, are you planning on finishing the whole thing in one sitting, or can you be convinced to take a break?\" you ask after a few seconds.\n\n Vincent blinks, like he just now remembers where he is. \"Oh!\" He glances at his coffee—mostly melted now—and then back at you. \"I mean... I could take a break.\"\n\n \"Good,\" you say, stretching your arms over your head. \"Because I'm not letting you escape back into 1950s existential despair just yet.\"\n\n Vincent chuckles, a little sheepish but clearly easing up. \"Guess I should've seen that coming.\"\n\n \n \n \"That must be one hell of a book,\" you say. \"What's got you so hooked?\"\n\n Vincent doesn't startle. Instead, he blinks, as if processing your words, then lifts his gaze to meet yours with quiet curiosity. His fingers hover over the page he was just reading, like part of him is still half in the story.\n\n \"Oh,\" he says, voice soft but not uncertain. \"Hey, [name].\"\n\n His expression shifts, and for a second, you catch something like relief in his face. Like he's genuinely happy to see you.\n\n He gestures vaguely to the book in front of him. East of Eden.\n\n \"Steinbeck,\" he says simply, like that should explain everything.\n\n You glance down at the cover, tilting your head. \"Right. That book.\"\n\n Vincent picks up on your tone. \"You have no idea what it's about, do you?\"\n\n \"Not really,\" you say, shrugging. \"Something about... California? Farms?\"\n\n That gets a small but quiet laugh out of him. \"That's... not wrong,\" he admits. He shifts in his seat, sitting up a little straighter. \"But it's more than that. It's about two families over multiple generations, and the whole thing kind of mirrors Cain and Abel, but also not exactly? It's more like—\" He pauses, his hands moving slightly as he searches for the right words. \"It's about choice, I guess. You've got Caleb—he's one of the brothers—who spends the whole book trying to prove he's not inherently bad because of where he comes from. But there's this huge question of whether he even can be good, or if he's doomed to be like his mother, who—well, okay, that's spoilers, but trust me, she's awful.\"\n\n Vincent takes a quick breath, his foot bouncing lightly under the table, and glances up at you sheepishly. \"Sorry. I'm rambling.\"\n\n You smirk, sliding into the seat across from him. \"No, keep going. You were just getting dramatic. I was waiting for the monologue.\"\n\n Vincent rolls his eyes, but you can tell he's pleased. \"I just like books that say something, you know? The kind that makes you think about yourself without realizing it. Like, this book—it makes me wonder if people are actually stuck being the way they are, or if they can really change.\"\n\n He runs his fingers along the spine, thoughtful. \"I keep thinking about this one part—Caleb, he finds out his dad lost a bunch of money, right? And his first instinct is to fix it, to prove himself. But the whole book's been setting up this idea that he might be destined to be bad, so you're just waiting to see what kind of choice he makes.\"\n\n You nod slowly, not because you get it, but because you get him. Vincent talks about books like they're living things, like they matter in a way that goes beyond just words on a page.\n\n \"Sounds intense,\" you say.\n\n Vincent hums in agreement, tapping his pen lightly against the table. \"It is. But that's what I like about it. It makes you think.\"\n\n For a moment, the two of you sit in easy silence, the quiet hum of the library wrapping around you. Then Vincent exhales, rubbing the back of his neck.\n\n \"[name], I've been here for hours,\" he admits. \"I should probably take a break before my brain melts and I start writing essays in my sleep.\"\n\n \"Wow, Vinny admitting he needs a break?\" you say, a wide smirk on your face. \"That must be serious.\"\n\n \"Shut up,\" Vincent says, huffing as he stuffs his notes into his bag. There's no bite to his words though, just the usual warmth. He hesitates slightly before adding, \"You wanna get coffee?\"\n\n It's not a casual invitation, at least not for Vincent. He's not the type to just ask people to hang out unless he's sure they won't mind.\n\n And honestly? You don't mind.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, standing up. \"Let's go.\"\n\n \n You take a breath, straighten your posture, and go for it.\n\n \"You didn't start the adventure without me, did you? I thought we were in this together!\"\n\n Vincent jumps so hard that his pen nearly flies out of his hand. His head snaps up, wide eyes darting around in panic before locking onto you, his brain visibly buffering as he tries to process what just happened. His shoulders are tense, his mouth slightly open like he's caught mid-thought. For a moment, he just stares at you, looking like a startled deer caught in headlights.\n\n Then, all at once, his brain seems to catch up. He exhales sharply, slumping back against his chair as he presses a hand to his chest. \"Oh my God, [name],\" he mutters, blinking rapidly. \"You almost gave me a heart attack.\"\n\n You grin, sliding into the seat across from him like this was your plan all along. \"I had to. You were in so deep that I thought I lost you to the pages forever.\"\n\n Vincent huffs, shaking his head as he glances down at his book. \"I just—I got caught up. You know how it is.\"\n\n \"Oh, I don't, actually,\" you tease, leaning on the table. \"Enlighten me, O Keeper of the Literature.\"\n\n Vincent snorts, rolling his eyes, but you can see the small smile tugging at the corner of his lips. He shifts slightly, tapping the book with his index finger. \"It's East of Eden by John Steinbeck. I've been meaning to read it properly for a while.\"\n\n You glance at the thick novel in front of him. The cover is simple, worn from years of being handled, and the title is printed in bold letters. \"East of Eden,\" you repeat, tilting your head. \"That's, uh... the one about farms, right?\"\n\n Vincent looks at you like you just declared that reading books might make your brain explode.\n\n You hold up your hands, desperate to defend yourself. \"Hey, I sort of know things! I think my English teacher mentioned it once.\"\n\n Vincent sighs, but there's amusement in it. \"It's a lot more than just farms. It's about these families and how their lives mirror the story of Cain and Abel. There's this whole generational thing, like the cycles of good and evil repeating, and it's all wrapped up in these huge philosophical ideas about free will and fate.\"\n\n You blink. \"That sounds... intense.\"\n\n \"It is,\" Vincent says, eyes flicking back down to the pages like he's already thinking about the next chapter. \"But in a good way. Steinbeck doesn't just tell you a story—he makes you feel it, like every single character is a real person. Some of them are awful, some are good, but none of them are just one thing. It's... really complicated.\"\n\n You watch him for a second. The way he leans forward, his fingers moving slightly as he talks, his words coming out with a rare kind of confidence. When Vincent's talking about something he really cares about, it's like the rest of the world fades into the background.\n\n \"Okay, I have to say,\" you say, smirking. \"Are you reading this for school, or is this just a Vincent passion project?\"\n\n \"Definitely a passion project,\" he says without hesitation. \"I like reading stuff on my own before a teacher gets to it. That way, I don't have to sit through their terrible explanations.\"\n\n You chuckle. \"Not a fan of Mr. Reeds' rambles?\"\n\n Vincent groans, dragging a hand down his face. \"If he gets a book's themes wrong one more time, I might actually die.\"\n\n You laugh, shaking your head. \"Okay, fair.\" Then you gesture toward the book. \"Well, since I just saved you from being completely consumed by a book, I vote we take a break.\"\n\n Vincent blinks. \"A break?\"\n\n \"Yeah, you know, a break,\" you say. \"You've been buried in that thing for who knows how long. Let's do something that doesn't involve tiny handwriting and existential crises.\"\n\n Vincent hesitates for a moment, looking down at his book like it physically pains him to put it down. But then he exhales, closing it gently. \"I guess a break wouldn't hurt.\"\n\n You grin, mission accomplished. \"That's the spirit.\"\n \n\n[Choice: Take a break]",

      "text": "The library café is a quiet little space nestled near the entrance, a mix of dark wood tables and soft, overstuffed chairs. The low hum of conversation blends with the gentle clatter of ceramic mugs and the occasional hiss of the espresso machine. The whole place smells like old books and coffee beans, like the scene has seeped into the walls over the years. A few students sit scattered around the café too, some hunched over laptops with others scribbling in notebooks while nursing half-empty cups of coffee.\n\nVincent walks in like he's done this a hundred times before, barely hesitating before heading straight for the counter. The way he moves—so naturally, so automatically—tells you everything you need to know.\n\n\"You come here a lot, don't you?\" you say, watching as he digs around in his pocket for his wallet.\n\n\"Uh,\" he says, freezing for a second. \"Define a lot.\"\n\nBefore you can answer, the barista, a college-aged girl with thick curly hair that reaches to her shoulders, glances up from wiping down the counter and gives Vincent a knowing smile. \"Back already?\"\n\nVincent coughs. \"Hi, Clair.\"\n\n\"The usual?\" she asks.\n\n\"Yes, please.\"\n\nYou blink. \"Vincent, she knows your usual?\"\n\nVincent shifts his weight, suddenly looking like he's reconsidering all his life choices. \"I—I mean, I do spend a lot of time here,\" he says, avoiding your gaze like he's been caught lying. \"It's quiet. Good place to read. Good lighting.\"\n\nClair scoffs as she punches his order into the register. \"You come here for the lighting?\"\n\nVincent groans, already regretting everything. \"And the coffee,\" he mutters.\n\nYou smirk. \"So what you're really saying is, you come here because you're addicted to caffeine.\"\n\n\"Okay, yes,\" Vincent admits, sighing dramatically as he shoves a crumpled bill onto the counter. \"I might be a little—\" He makes an indistinct gesture with his hands. \"—slightly dependent on coffee.\"\n\n\"Slightly?\" you repeat.\n\n\"Slightly,\" he insists, like saying it more will make it true.\n\nClair, clearly amused, starts making his drink with automatic efficiency.\n\nYou glance at Vincent and smirk. \"Even she doesn't believe you.\"\n\nVincent groans, dragging a hand down his face. \"Look, I need it, okay? Caffeine is basically my lifeline. If I don't have coffee, I turn into—\" He pauses, then frowns. \"Actually, I don't know what I turn into, because I've never let it happen.\"\n\nYou snort. \"Sounds dangerous. Should I be concerned?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Vincent says, completely serious. Then, after a beat, he tilts his head at you. \"Wait, [name]. You do drink coffee, right?\"\n\nYou glance at the menu, skimming the options. \"Yeah, obviously.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Vincent says, nodding solemnly. \"Because I don't trust people who don't drink coffee.\"\n\n\"That's your dealbreaker?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\nVincent nods. \"Yep. No caffeine? No friendship.\"\n\nClair places his drink on the counter—a large, overfilled cup of coffee that he's had many times before. He thanks her quietly, gripping the cup with both hands like it's a sacred artifact.\n\nYou shake your head, amused, and step up to the register.\n\n[Choice: Get a black coffee]\n[Choice: Get a caramel latte]\n[Choice: Get an iced mocha]\n[Choice: Skip coffee]",

Then Vincent tilts his head, clearly surprised. \"Black coffee?\"\n\n You nod. \"Yeah.\"\n\n He stares at you for a second like he's trying to figure out if you're serious. Then, after another pause, he nods, a slow look of approval settling on his face. \"Huh. Okay.\"\n\n Clair, the barista, barely reacts as she punches in the order. \"One black coffee,\" she mutters, turning to prep it.\n\n Vincent leans against the counter, still watching you with intrigue. \"I gotta admit, [name], I didn't see that coming. Black coffee is, like, the purest form of caffeine. No sugar, no milk, no distractions—just coffee.\"\n\n \"What, you thought I'd order something covered in whipped cream?\" you ask, shrugging.\n\n He smirks. \"I mean, you do have the energy of someone who'd get a caramel drizzle situation.\"\n\n You can't help but roll your eyes. \"Can't believe you'd stereotype my coffee choices.\"\n\n Vincent chuckles. \"But yeah, black coffee. That's real. That's some grizzled detective in a noir film kind of drink. Total 'I've seen things, kid' energy.\"\n\n \"Don't make it weird.\"\n\n \"It's already weird.\"\n\n At this point, Clair places the finished coffee on the counter, waiting for payment.\n\n <<if [money] > 4>> \n \n You reach into your pocket and pull out your phone, placing it on the reader without hesitation. Vincent watches you pay, still looking mildly impressed.\n\n \"See, now I'm really questioning everything,\" he says, taking a sip of his own coffee. \"You actually chose to drink black coffee. On purpose.\"\n\n You smirk. \"Scared?\"\n\n \"Absolutely not. Just saying you chose a difficult path.\"\n \n \n You look at your phone to see you only have [money] dollars, not enough to even buy a coffee. Vincent notices your expression changing immediately and doesn't even hesitate before sliding a couple of bills across the counter.\n\n You blink. \"Wait, what—?\"\n\n \"It's coffee,\" he says simply, as if that explains everything.\n\n \"You didn't even let me ask—\"\n\n \"Again, [name]. It's coffee.\"\n \n\n You grab your coffee and take a sip, letting the sharp bitterness hit your tongue. No sweetness, no cream—just coffee in its rawest form. Vincent watches like he's expecting you to immediately regret everything, but when you don't react, he exhales and shakes his head.\n\n \"Yeah, okay, respect,\" he mutters. \"I could never do that. I need some sugar, at least. But I admire your commitment to suffering.\"\n\n \"I appreciate it,\" you say, smirking.\n\n It's quiet for a second. Just the faint hum of the espresso machine and the quiet murmur of distant conversations.\n\n Then, Vincent clears his throat, shifting the mood. \"So, black coffee drinker. Since you've chosen this path, what's next? Gonna start monologuing about fate? Staring broodingly out of windows? Wearing a trench coat?\"\n\n \"Maybe,\" you say. \"I do like a good dramatic exit.\"\n\n \"Okay, well, if you do decide to go full noir detective, let me know. I'll be your quirky sidekick! I'll even bring a notebook and say something like, 'This case gets stranger by the second, boss.'\"\n\n You laugh and shake your head. \"Vinny, I think you've had too much coffee.\"\n\n He takes another sip, completely unrepentant. \"Impossible.\"\n\n \n \n You glance at the menu, scanning over the options. You could go simple, but honestly? A caramel latte sounds good—warm, smooth, just the right mix of sweet and bitter. The kind of drink that feels a little indulgent but still counts as real coffee.\n\n \"I'll take a caramel latte,\" you say, looking up at the barista.\n\n Vincent, who had been taking a cautious first sip of his own coffee, pauses mid-drink. He lowers his cup slightly, eyes flicking to you with something close to approval. \"Good choice,\" he says, nodding. \"It's got structure. Complexity. Balance.\"\n\n You snort. \"It's just coffee with caramel.\"\n\n Vincent shakes his head, his expression going serious. \"No. Nothing is ever just coffee. Coffee is history. Coffee is culture. Do you realize the entire Enlightenment was basically fueled by caffeine?\"\n\n \"I—what?\" you ask, blinking.\n\n Vincent's already gearing up for a full tangent, his hands gesturing slightly as he speaks. \"Before coffeehouses spread through Europe, people drank beer or wine all day because water wasn't safe. So naturally, once everyone switched from being mildly drunk all the time to being hyped up on caffeine instead, we got, you know, science, philosophy, the Industrial Revolution—\"\n\n \"Are you saying caramel lattes made the modern world?\" you interrupt.\n\n Vincent points at you. \"I'm saying coffee made the modern world, and caramel lattes are just the delicious continuation of that legacy.\"\n\n You shake your head, still grinning, and reach into your pocket to grab your phone.\n\n <<if [money] > 4>> \n \n You press your phone against the reader as the barista rings you up. Vincent watches, nodding in satisfaction. \"A fine investment,\" he says. \"You won't regret this.\"\n\n \"I didn't think I would regret buying coffee,\" you say, amused.\n \n \"You'd be surprised,\" Vincent mutters. \"I once ordered an iced vanilla latte at a franchise, and I swear it tasted like regret and melted candle wax.\"\n\n \"Sounds tragic,\" you say, stepping aside as Clair starts making your drink.\n\n \"It was tragic,\" Vincent sighs, taking another sip of his own coffee. \"But I have risen from that dark chapter in my life. And now, I only drink real coffee.\"\n \n \n You look at your balance and frown. Right. No money.\n\n Vincent catches this immediately. Without hesitation, he steps forward, sliding a few bills onto the counter before you can even protest. \"I got it.\"\n\n \"Vincent—\"\n\n \"It's coffee, [name].\" He gives you a look like this is the easiest decision he's ever made. \"I love coffee. Sharing coffee is basically my highest moral principle. If this were the 18th century, I'd be funding a whole coffeehouse just so I could drag people there to talk about books.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"You'd be a coffeehouse patron?\"\n\n \"Absolutely,\" Vincent says without hesitation. \"Like some eccentric scholar who spends all day writing about philosophical treatises while slowly ruining his health with excessive caffeine intake.\"\n\n \"Sounds exactly like how you are now.\"\n\n Vincent blinks. \"...I have always been consistent.\"\n\n You shake your head, smirking as the barista takes his money and starts making your drink.\n \n\n By the time your caramel latte is ready, Vincent is still lightly rambling about something—this time about how Honoré de Balzac supposedly drank fifty cups of coffee a day while writing. You don't interrupt. It's honestly fascinating how his brain just works, constantly moving and finding something interesting to talk about.\n\n You grab your drink, taking a sip. The warm, sweet mix of caramel and espresso hits instantly, smooth and just the right amount of strong.\n\n \"Not bad,\" you admit.\n\n Vincent leans forward slightly, watching your reaction like a scientist waiting for lab results. \"See? Balance. Complexity. A civilized drink.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but take another sip. \"Yeah, yeah. It's good.\"\n\n Vincent sits back, looking rather pleased with himself. \"Welcome to the Enlightenment, [name].\"\n\n \n You glance at the menu, considering your options for half a second before deciding, \"I'll have an iced mocha.\"\n\n Clair nods, punching it into the register. Before she even says the price, Vincent lets out a tiny, almost inaudible gasp.\n\n \"Chocolate?\" He says it like you just admitted to some unspeakable crime. His eyes narrow slightly, and then, with absolute seriousness, he mutters, \"We are in the age of decadence.\"\n\n You blink. \"What?\"\n\n Vincent sighs, shaking his head as if he's personally disappointed in you. \"We've fallen so far from the austere virtues of our ancestors. Once, people drank coffee for strength and survival. Now? It's all whipped cream and chocolate syrup. Bread and circuses.\"\n\n Clair snorts, clearly used to this kind of thing from him. \"You do realize you order vanilla syrup in your coffee every single time, right?\"\n\n Vincent stiffens slightly, but recovers quickly. \"That's different.\"\n\n \"How?\" you ask.\n\n \"It just is,\" Vincent insists, avoiding your gaze as he sips his coffee like he can physically will himself out of this conversation.\n\n <<if [money] > 4>> \n \n You reach into your pocket and pull out your phone to pay. You press your phone against the reader and take your receipt.\n\n Vincent watches the transaction like he's still debating whether or not he can respect you after this debacle. \"An iced mocha,\" he repeats, still pretending to be scandalized. \"You know, [name], the Roman Empire collapsed after centuries of self-indulgence and excess. Just saying!\"\n \n \n You reach into your pocket and look at your phone, only to realize—oh.\n\n You frown, looking at your balance. You don't have enough. \"Ugh, crap.\"\n\n Vincent just sighs and pulls out his wallet. \"It's fine,\" he says before you can even protest. He slides a few bills across the counter, nodding at Clair to continue.\n\n \"You really don't have to—\"\n\n \"it's coffee, [name],\" Vincent says dryly. \"Not a noble sacrifice.\"\n\n Clair hands you the receipt, and Vincent shakes his head at you as if this is yet another example of your many personal failings. \"First an iced mocha, now financial ruin. Next thing I know, you'll be wearing a toga and proclaiming yourself Emperor of Crestview Bay.\"\n \n\n You roll your eyes. \"I didn't realize my coffee order had historical consequences.\"\n\n Vincent shrugs, taking another sip of his drink. \"That's how it always starts.\"\n\n A minute later, Clair sets your iced mocha on the counter, and you grab it, immediately taking a long sip. It's cold, sweet, and exactly what you want. You glance at Vincent, who's still watching you like you're some kind of tragic figure from history.\n\n \"Just admit it,\" you say. \"You're jealous.\"\n\n Vincent scoffs. \"Of what?\"\n\n \"That my coffee actually tastes better than yours.\"\n\n \"I'll have you know that my coffee has integrity, dignity, and character,\" Vincent says, hand over heart.\n\n \"It tastes like burnt dirt, doesn't it?\"\n\n Vincent glares. \"It does not.\"\n\n You smirk, sipping your mocha again, while Vincent mutters something under his breath about moral decay and the inevitable fall of civilization.\n\n \n \n You glance up at the menu, skimming over the different coffee options, but nothing really jumps out at you. Honestly? You're just not feeling it right now. Either way, when Clair looks at you expectantly, waiting for your order, you just shake your head.\n\n \"I'm good,\" you say.\n\n The second the words leave your mouth, you feel Vincent go completely still beside you.\n\n You glance at him to see he's staring at you like you just admitted to some heinous crime.\n\n \"You're... good?\" he repeats slowly, like he's giving you a chance to correct this obvious mistake.\n\n You shrug. \"Yeah. I don't really want anything.\"\n\n Vincent squints. \"No coffee?\"\n\n \"Correct.\"\n\n \"Not even, like, a small one?\"\n\n \"Nope.\"\n\n Vincent's grip on his coffee tightens. He leans in slightly, lowering his voice like this is a conspiracy and not a casual decision. \"Do you not drink coffee?\"\n\n \"Are you interrogating me?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n \"I just—\" He hesitates, glancing at Clair, who is now very clearly eavesdropping and very entertained. He turns back to you, lowering his voice even further. \"You said you did. Earlier. A few seconds ago.\"\n\n \"I do sometimes,\" you clarify. \"I just don't want one right now.\"\n\n Vincent looks deeply, deeply unconvinced.\n\n \"So you're saying that in this situation, in this prime coffee-acquiring environment, you chose to opt out?\"\n\n \"Yes?\"\n\n Vincent leans back, his face unreadable, before taking a slow, deliberate sip of his coffee, maintaining eye contact the entire time.\n\n You snort. \"Are you judging me right now?\"\n\n He swallows. \"Yes.\"\n\n Clair, still listening in, coughs to cover up a laugh. Vincent ignores her. His foot starts bouncing as he processes this new, deeply disturbing revelation about you.\n\n \"You know, I just—I trusted you,\" he says finally, shaking his head. \"I thought I understood who you were.\"\n\n \"Oh my God,\" you mutter.\n\n Vincent sighs. \"You had the chance. You had the opportunity to get something, anything, but you just—\" He shakes his head, looking genuinely disappointed. \"Like Caesar ignoring the warnings of the Ides of March, you walked straight past fate and into disaster.\"\n \n \"Are you seriously comparing not getting coffee to Julius Caesar getting assassinated?\"\n\n Vincent takes a slow, solemn sip of his drink. \"History will judge you, [name].\"\n \n\n[Choice: Take a seat]",

      "text": "You and Vincent settle into a table near the window, the warm glow of the setting sun casting long shadows across the worn wooden surface. Outside, the quiet streets of Crestview Bay stretch out beneath a sky tinged with the soft pinks and oranges of early evening.\n\nVincent adjusts his chair slightly, making himself comfortable, before wrapping both hands around his coffee cup like it's a source of warmth and security. He exhales softly, letting the moment settle, and for the first time all afternoon, he looks at ease. No frantic page-flipping, no hurried note-taking—just a quiet sense of contentment.\n\n\"This place is kind of nice in the evening,\" Vincent muses, glancing toward the window. \"Gets quieter. Cozier. More library, less public building.\"\n\nYou smirk. \"You say that like it's some secret hidden gem.\"\n\n\"That's because it is,\" Vincent insists. \"Most people don't come to the café here. Which is great because that means I can usually get my favorite seat.\n\nHe vaguely gestures toward a corner table near a bookshelf lined with old hardcovers. It's tucked away, a perfect spot for someone who wants to disappear into a book for a few hours without interruption.\n\n\"Wait,\" you say, raising an eyebrow. \"You have a designated seat?\"\n\nVincent nods. \"Obviously. You don't just pick any seat in a place you frequent. You pick the best seat.\"\n\nYou glance at the two people sitting at that table. \"And yet, we're sitting over here.\"\n\nVincent sighs dramatically, as if explaining some deep philosophical burden. \"It's occupied. Tragic, really. But sacrifices must be made.\"\n\nYou shake your head in amusement. \"You're unbelievable, Vincent.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Vincent says, sipping on his coffee as if you just paid him a genuine compliment.\n\nThe two of you lapse into silence, the kind that doesn't demand to be filled. The murmur of the espresso machine hums in the background, accompanied by the occasional clink of cups and the soft rustling of pages from a nearby student. It's easy, sitting here like this.\n\nVincent drums his fingers lightly against the side of his cup, thoughtful. \"It's kind of weird,\" he admits after a moment. \"I don't... usually do this.\"\n\nYou glance at him. \"Do what?\"\n\nHe shrugs slightly, gaze flickering to the window. \"Just... hang out.\"\n\nThere's no awkwardness in the admission, but there's a quiet honesty to it. You already know Vincent doesn't have a big social circle. He's never been the kind of person who gets invited to parties. Not because people don't like him, but because he's always been just a little out of sync with everyone else. Always lost in his books, always thinking a few steps too deeply, always worrying about whether he's saying the right thing.\n\n\"You make it sound like this is some rare event,\" you say.\n\nVincent gives a small, self-deprecating smile. \"I mean, it kind of is? Usually, if I'm out somewhere, it's because I need to be. Like for school or books or something with a specific purpose.\" He gestures vaguely to his coffee cup. \"Not just... this.\"\n\nYou lean back slightly. \"Well, congrats. You're officially hanging out like a normal person.\"\n\nVincent laughs, his expression softening. \"Wild.\"\n\nYou chuckle along, wondering where you should steer the conversation now.\n\n[Choice: Talk about books]\n[Choice: Talk about school]\n[Choice: Talk about personal interests]",

      "text": "You prop your elbow on the table and smirk. \"Alright, since we're already in full literary nerd mode, what's your all-time favorite book?\"\n\n Vincent blinks, clearly not expecting the question. Then he straightens in his chair, his fingers gripping his coffee cup a little tighter. \"Oh. Oh, that's a dangerous question.\"\n\n \"Dangerous how?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n \"Because,\" Vincent says, suddenly looking very serious, \"no one has just one favorite book.\"\n\n You snort. \"Okay, fine. Give me one of them.\"\n\n Vincent's expression shifts—excited, thoughtful, and a little too intense. It's almost like he's trying to pluck the perfect answer from the shelves of the endless library in his head.\n\n \"Okay,\" he says, after a moment, leaning forward slightly. \"If I had to pick just one... It's probably The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov.\"\n\n You stare blankly. \"The what and the who?\"\n\n Vincent grins, eyes lighting up. \"It's this weird, kind of surreal Russian novel. It's about—okay, stay with me here—the Devil coming to Soviet Moscow and just completely messing with everyone. But it's also about this writer struggling with censorship, and there's this whole side story about Pontius Pilate, and there's a talking cat who drinks vodka and plays chess—\"\n\n \"What?\"\n\n Vincent's already too far gone to slow down. \"And there's this love story, and there's this amazing satire of government and bureaucracy, and there's also this whole philosophical discussion about good and evil, but it's also really funny? Like, in that dark, chaotic way where you don't know whether you should be laughing or deeply concerned.\"\n\n You just blink at him as he keeps going, his hands moving more animatedly now.\n\n \"It's just so good,\" he continues, completely in his own world. \"The way Bulgakov wrote it—he was literally fighting against Soviet censorship while writing this insanely bold, ridiculous book that somehow manages to be hilarious, tragic, romantic, and existential all at once. And there's this one scene—okay, so, one of the characters—he's basically cursed, and the Devil's whole crew is just toying with him, and at one point, he gets tricked into—\"\n\n Vincent stops mid-sentence.\n\n He looks at you. Really looks at you.\n\n And for the first time since he started talking, he seems to realize that he's been going on about this random Russian novel like it's the most normal conversation topic in the world.\n\n His face shifts from excitement to dawning horror.\n\n \"Oh,\" he says, visibly deflating. \"I'm... talking way too much, aren't I?\"\n\n You don't even get a chance to answer before he groans and drops his head onto his folded arms on the table. \"I do this all the time,\" he mutters into his sleeve, his voice muffled. \"I get excited, and then I just go, and then suddenly I'm deep into 20th-century Russian literature, and no one cares, and—ugh.\"\n\n \"Hey, I did ask,\" you say, laughing.\n\n Vincent peeks up at you from his arms, hesitant. \"Yeah, but did you really want a five-minute dissertation?\"\n\n You smirk. \"I mean... it was definitely a commitment.\"\n\n Vincent groans again, dramatically dragging his hands down his face before sitting up. \"I'm so bad at normal conversation,\" he mumbles, looking vaguely mortified.\n\n You shrug. \"Eh, at least you're passionate.\"\n\n He exhales and shakes his head. \"That's one way to put it.\"\n\n Despite his embarrassment, you can see a faint smile lingering at the edges of his lips. It's like even if he knows he got carried away, he doesn't totally regret it.\n\n He glances down at his now-empty cup, realizing he's finished his coffee at some point during his tangent. \"Alright,\" he says, standing up and stretching. \"What I should do is stop rambling and actually do what I came here for.\"\n\n \"Which is?\"\n\n Vincent slings his bag over his shoulder. \"More books.\"\n\n \"Of course,\" you say, pushing your chair back as you stand up.\n\n With that, the two of you make your way back to the library shelves, Vincent leading the way.\n\n \n \"You said you don't hang out much,\" you say, watching Vincent carefully. \"Why not?\"\n\n Vincent hesitates, his fingers tightening slightly around his coffee cup. For a moment, it looks like he might deflect, but then he exhales, staring down at the table like hes trying to find the right words written somewhere in the wood grain.\n\n \"It's not like I don't want to,\" he admits, voice quieter now. \"It's just... I don't know. I guess I'm not very good at it.\"\n\n You tilt your head. \"At... what? Having friends?\"\n\n \"Kind of,\" he says, rubbing the back of his neck. \"I mean, I have friends, technically. But they're more like—\" He pauses, frowning slightly. \"You ever have people in your life that you just sort of orbit around? Like, you're there, you exist in the same space, but you're not really important to each other?\"\n\n You nod slowly. \"Yeah.\"\n\n \"Well, that's me,\" Vincent says, a little too matter-of-factly. \"I'm around, but I'm never in things, you know? Like, I'll be part of a group project, or I'll sit around with people at lunch sometimes, but if I just... stopped showing up, I don't think anyone would really notice.\"\n\n There's no bitterness in the way he says it, just quiet acceptance.\n\n You frown. \"That's not true.\"\n\n Vincent shrugs. \"I mean, it kind of is? And it's fine. It's not like people are mean to me or anything. I just—I don't know. It always feels like I'm a guest in other people's friend groups, like I'm only there because it's convenient and not because anyone actually wants me there.\"\n\n You watch him carefully. He's not fishing for pity. If anything, he's trying to downplay it, to make it seem like it doesn't really bother him. But you can tell—it does.\n\n \"That's why I like books,\" Vincent continues, tapping a finger against his empty cup. \"You don't have to figure out where you fit. You just do. The story doesn't care if you're awkward or if you say the wrong thing. You don't have to try with books.\"\n\n His voice stays light, like he's just stating a fact, but you can sense something raw beneath it.\n\n You don't try to fix it though. You decide to just listen. \"That makes sense.\"\n\n Vincent blinks, like he was expecting you to argue. \"It does?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"I mean, books are better than most people.\"\n\n That gets a small, genuine laugh out of him. \"Right?\"\n\n The tension in his shoulders eases a little, and he leans back in his chair, exhaling.\n\n \"I don't hate people, though,\" he adds after a moment. \"I just... I don't know. I think I try too hard, and it never works, so then I just feel like an idiot.\" He shakes his head. \"I always think, like—maybe if I say the right thing, or act a certain way, people will actually like me.\"\n\n \"You don't have to do that,\" you say simply.\n\n Vincent pauses.\n\n \"I mean, you're doing fine right now,\" you point out. \"I'm here, aren't I?\"\n\n Vincent blinks at you, and for the first time, he looks genuinely caught off guard.\n\n \"That's different,\" he mutters, like he doesn't quite know how to process that statement. \"You're—you're, you know. You.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Great explanation, Vinny. Crystal clear.\"\n\n Vincent groans, shaking his head. \"Shut up. You know what I mean.\"\n\n You smirk, but you let him have that one.\n\n Vincent finishes off the last sip of coffee, setting the empty c up down with a soft thunk. He glances toward the library, thoughtful.\n\n \"You wanna go look at some books?\" he asks. \"I mean, you did come all the way here. Feels like a waste if we don't at least browse.\"\n\n It's an easy excuse, but it's also an invitation. A way to stretch this out just a little longer.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, pushing your chair back. \"Let's go.\"\n\n \n You tilt your head, watching Vincent thoughtfully. \"Okay, serious question—what's something you love that has nothing to do with books?\"\n\n Vincent blinks, caught off guard. \"Uh.\"\n\n He hesitates, fingers tightening around his coffee cup like you just asked him a complex philosophical question. His foot bounces lightly under the table, and you can see his brain short-circuiting as he tries to come up with an answer.\n\n \"Uhhhhh,\" he says again, dragging the sound out like it might magically summon a response.\n\n You smirk. \"That hard of a question?\"\n\n \"It is!\" Vincent insists, waving a hand like he's trying to physically push the question away. \"I mean, it's not like I only read, but—\" He stops, then groans, dragging a hand down his face. \n \n \"Apparently, liking nerdy stuff is just my entire personality now,\" he mutters. He shoots you a look, then glances vaguely upward, like he's addressing someone else entirely. \"I guess someone thought to just make Vincent the walking encyclopedia and call it a day.\"\n\n You blink. \"...Who are you talking to?\"\n\n \"No one,\" Vincent says, taking a long sip of coffee. \"Absolutely no one.\"\n\n \"Well, there's got to be something,\" you say, amused. \"Like, do you play an instrument? Cook? Are you secretly an amazing athlete?\"\n\n Vincent snorts. \"Absolutely not an athlete. I once nearly dislocated my shoulder trying to do a pull-up in gym class.\"\n\n \"How?\"\n\n \"I don't know!\" Vincent exclaims, exasperated. \"I think my body just wasn't built for sports. Like, physically and philosophically incompatible.\"\n\n You laugh. \"Okay, fine, so no sports. What else?\"\n\n Vincent frowns, staring at the table like he's digging deep into his soul for an answer. Then, after a long moment, he lets out a breath and mutters, almost like he doesn't want you to hear it—\n\n \"...I like baking.\"\n\n You blink.\n\n \"Baking?\" you repeat, making sure you heard him right.\n\n Vincent rubs the back of his neck, looking vaguely embarrassed. \"Yeah. It's, uh, relaxing.\"\n\n \"So, you—Vincent, the guy who practically lives in the library—spend all your free time making cookies and cakes?\"\n\n \"Not all my free time,\" Vincent mutters, looking away. \"It's just... nice. It's one of the only things where my brain actually shuts up for a while, you know? I get to do something with my hands, and I don't have to analyze or overthink it. Plus, food is science! Chemistry. Precision. There's a method to it. It's like following a formula, except at the end, you get cake instead of a math problem.\"\n\n You stare at him for a second, then shake your head with a grin. \"I honestly can't decide if this is nerdier than your usual stuff or not.\"\n\n Vincent sighs, shaking his head dramatically. \"This is why I don't tell people things.\"\n\n \"Hey, I love this,\" you say, still grinning. \"You went full Aristotle on coffee earlier, but now you're just out here making brownies in your free time?\"\n\n Vincent huffs. \"Well, when you say it like that, it sounds weird.\"\n\n \"It's not weird,\" you assure him. \"It's just unexpected. In a good way.\"\n\n Vincent watches you for a second before shaking his head. \"Well, there goes my entire carefully curated mysterious library dweller image.\"\n\n \"You never had that image.\"\n\n \"[name], let me pretend,\" Vincent groans, finishing the last sip of his coffee before setting the empty cup aside.\n\n Still amused, you stand up as he does, watching as he glances back toward the main library.\n\n \"Anyway,\" he says, stretching slightly. \"I should stop being a person and go back to being a nerd. Wanna head back to the shelves? I was looking at a few more books earlier, but I got distracted.\"\n\n \"Yeah, let's go,\" you say, nodding.\n \n\n[Choice: Browse the shelves]",

      "text": "The two of you slip back into the main part of the library, the café's warmth fading into the cool, hushed stillness of the book-lined aisles. The space feels different now—less like a study hall and more like a secret world waiting to be explored. The scent of old paper and ink lingers in the air, wrapping around you like a well-worn sweater.\n\nVincent moves through the aisles, his fingers occasionally grazing the spines of books as he walks, like he's greeting old friends. He doesn't hesitate, doesn't scan titles at random. He knows exactly where he's going.\n\n\"You ever get the feeling that libraries are just... better than the real world?\" he muses.\n\nYou smirk. \"Is that your way of saying you'd rather live in one?\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" Vincent says, like it's the most natural answer in the world. \"Think about it. No loud crowds, no awkward small talk, no pressure to be cool—just unlimited books, free coffee refills, and maybe the occasional cat wandering around.\"\n\nYou chuckle. \"You've really thought this through.\"\n\n\"Of course I have,\" he says, then stops in front of a shelf. \"Okay. You, [name], need a book.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Do I?\"\n\nVincent gives you a look. \"Yes. You came to a library, and I'm not letting you leave without a book.\"\n\nHe scans the shelf with the practiced ease of someone who's spent far too many hours doing this. His eyes dart from title to title before he suddenly stops, plucks a book off the shelf, and turns to you, holding it out like an offering.\n\n\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower?\" you read off the cover, glancing at him. \"You think this is my vibe?\"\n\nVincent shrugs. \"It's a good read. Easy but actually meaningful. Plus, it's got that whole figuring yourself out while being slightly emotionally wrecked thing going for it, which—\" He gestures vaguely at you. \"Seems like something you'd relate to.\"\n\nYou snort. \"Wow. Way to call me out.\"\n\n\"Am I wrong?\" Vincent says, grinning.\n\nYou roll your eyes. \"You better be right about this.\"\n\nVincent crosses his arms. \"If I'm wrong, you can publicly shame me in the middle of the library next time.\"\n\n\"Deal.\"\n\nThe two of you wander to the front, neither of you in a hurry to leave but both knowing the hangout is winding down. There's a quiet comfort in the moment, an understanding that lingers without needing to be spoken aloud.\n\nVincent adjusts the strap of his bag, glancing at you as you reach the entrance. \"This was nice,\" he says hesitantly, like the words feel foreign in his mouth. \"We should—\" He stops himself, then clears his throat. \"You know. Do it again sometime.\"\n\nYou smirk. \"Did you just almost ask me to hang out?\"\n\nVincent groans. \"I did ask you to hang out, don't make it weird.\"\n\nYou chuckle, tucking the book under your arm. \"Alright, alright. Yeah, let's do this again.\"\n\nVincent nods, looking oddly satisfied. \"Good.\"\n\nAnd with that, he gives you a small wave before heading off in his own direction, disappearing between the towering bookshelves like he was always meant to be there.\n\nYou glance down at the book in your hands, flipping it open to the first page before stepping out of the library.\n\n[Choice: Finish up]",

      "text": "The shrill ring of your phone jolts you awake. You groggily blink at the screen, squinting against the early morning light. Jessica Sanders. The queen bee of Pacific Crest High School. You hesitate for a moment before swiping to answer.\n\n \n The moment you pick up, Jessica's voice floods through the speaker, crisp and commanding. \"[name]! you're awake, right?\" She doesn't give you any time to respond before continuing. \"Good, because this is important. It's Homecoming Week, and today is Pajama Day.\"\n\n You rub your eyes, trying to process her words. \"Pajama Day? It's... Monday morning, Jessica.\"\n\n Jessica sighs like she's dealing with a particularly slow child. \"That means you are not showing up in those tragic cargo shorts and a plain white T-shirt. I swear, [name], you dress like a divorced dad on his weekend off.\"\n\n You frown, sitting up. \"Hey, what's wrong with my outfit?\"\n\n \"Everything,\" she deadpans. \"Look, just for today, wear something normal. \"\n\n You rub your temples, trying to keep up. \"Why do you even care what I wear?\"\n\n Jessica stops for a second as if you had just asked why the sky is blue. \"Because it's Homecoming Week! School spirit? Participation? Making sure our school doesn't look like we can't even commit to a simple theme day?\" She pauses for dramatic effect. \"Besides, it's literally the easiest one. I bet you're wearing pajamas right now. You just roll out of bed, and boom, you're done.\"\n\n \"Alright,\" you say.\n\n \"I just figured I'd make sure you weren't gonna be the one person who shows up looking like it's just another Monday. Plus, let's be honest here—you could use a break from those cargo shorts.\"\n\n A small smirk tugs at your lips. \"Is that a compliment or an insult?\"\n\n \"I'll leave it to you to discern,\" she says, laughing gently. \"Just think about it, okay?\"\n\n \n \n The second you answer, Jessica's voice comes through, smooth and to the point. \"Hey, [name]. Just checking—are you dressing up for Pajama Day?\"\n\n You blink groggily at your phone. \"What?\"\n\n She exhales, not quite annoyed, but definitely impatient. \"It's Homecoming Week. Today's Pajama Day. I'm trying to make sure as many people as possible actually participate.\"\n\n You rub your face, trying to wake up. \"And you're calling me because...?\"\n\n Jessica pauses, then says, \"Because it's better when more people join in. It makes things feel less boring.\" There's no sharp edge to her voice, just a matter-of-factness that makes it clear she cares—at least about the event, if not about you personally.\n\n You hesitate, and she adds, \"Look, it's the easiest theme day. You don't even have to try, just wear pajamas and call it a win. If you show up in cargo shorts, I will judge you.\"\n\n \"Anyway, do whatever,\" she adds as an afterthought. \"Just figured I'd check.\"\n \n \n The second you answer, Jessica's voice comes through, bright and chipper. \"[name]! Tell me you're actually dressing up today.\"\n\n You blink at your phone. \"Uh... what?\"\n\n She sighs, but there's a teasing edge to it. \"Homecoming Week? Pajama Day? Ringing any bells?\"\n\n You rub your face, trying to wake up. \"Oh. Right. That's today?\"\n\n \"Yes, that's today. And I am personally making sure everyone who matters actually participates.\" Her tone shifts, a little lighter. \"And you, [name], do matter. So don't be lame.\"\n\n \"Wow, I'm honored,\" you say, smirking.\n\n \"You should be,\" she replies, but you can hear the grin in her voice. \"Don't ruin it by wearing your cargo shorts.\"\n\n You chuckle. \"Cargo shorts would ruin Homecoming Week?\"\n\n \"Absolutely,\" she says without hesitation. \"You have a reputation to uphold.\"\n \n \n\n[Choice: Listen to Jessica and wear pajamas]\n[Choice: Ignore her and wear regular clothes]",

The air smells like overcooked pasta and something vaguely resembling garlic bread. After you get a tray, you head straight to your usual spot, where Luke and Samantha have already claimed your usual table.\n\nLuke spots you first, mid-bite into some spaghetti. He waves, barely managing to chew before swallowing. \"Dude! Took you long enough.\"\n\nSamantha, sitting across from him, doesn't even glance up from peeling the label off her apple. \"Yeah, we were about to send out a search party. Maybe put your face on a milk carton.\"\n\nYou drop into the open seat beside Luke with a sigh. \"You guys are so dramatic.\"\n\nLuke grins. \"Yeah, we are, but that's why you love us.\"\n\nSamantha finally looks up, a smirk on her face. \"He says 'love'. I say 'tolerate.'\"\n\nLuke places a hand over his chest. \"Wow. Can you believe this, [name]? The betrayal.\"\n\nYou snort. \"Honestly? I can.\"\n\nSamantha flashes you a knowing smile before turning back to Luke. \"Anyway, we were just talking about the most important topic of the day.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Which is?\"\n\nLuke leans forward, completely serious. \"How long I could survive on a deserted island.\"\n\nYou blink. \"What?\"\n\nSamantha sighs, shaking her head. \"He thinks he'd last a month.\"\n\nYou stare at Luke. \"A month?\"\n\n\"Why is that so unbelievable?\" Luke asks, throwing his hands up.\n\nSamantha jabs a finger at Luke. \"Because you tried to toast ramen noodles once.\"\n\nLuke groans. \"Look, it was an experiment!\"\n\n\"An experiment in what?\" you ask, already dreading the answer.\n\nHe shrugs. \"I don't know. Alternative cooking methods.\"\n\nSamantha raises an eyebrow. \"Luke, you put them in a fucking toaster.\"\n\nLuke throws up his hands. \"How was I supposed to know they'd catch on fire?\"\n\n\"Common sense?\" you ask, staring at him.\n\nLuke scoffs. \"Whatever you say, Einstein.\"\n\n\"Luke, come on,\" you say, trying to get him to see reason. \"If you got stranded on an island, you'd die pretty quickly.\"\n\n\"No faith in me. None. At. All.\"\n\nSamantha pats his arm. \"At least you'd go down in history. First man to invent 'beach fire ramen' and immediately perish.\"\n\nThe conversation moves on to other ridiculous topics—whether a hot dog is a sandwich, the questionable history of the school's mystery meat, if the cafeteria lady is actually part of the mafia—but eventually, after the laughter dies down a bit, Samantha leans back and looks at you more seriously.\n\n\"So, [name].\" She takes a sip of her water. \"We have to ask you something important. Something crucial.\"\n\nYou glance between them, immediately getting suspicious. \"...Go on.\"\n\nLuke grins, but there's something almost mischievous in it. \"Hypothetically, like in an alternate universe or something—what's your type?\"\n\nYou pause, your brain short-circuiting for a second. \"My what?\"\n\nSamantha smirks. \"You know what we mean, [name]. Your type. Crushes. Romance. The people you secretly pine over when you stare dramatically out a window.\"\n\n\"I do not do that.\"\n\nLuke gasps. \"Wait. Do you have a secret crush?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nSamantha leans forward, resting her chin on her hand. \"That wasn't very convincing.\"\n\nYou groan. \"Why are we even talking about this?\"\n\n\"Because we talk about everything and somehow this has never come up?\"\n\n\"Seriously,\" Samantha says, gesturing vaguely at you. \"You've never mentioned anyone. Not even in passing.\"\n\n\"Yeah, dude,\" Luke nods. \"There's gotta be something.\"\n\nYou rub the back of your neck as you think of how to answer.\n\n[Choice: I guess I've always been into girls]\n[Choice: I think I've always liked guys more]\n[Choice: I mean... both?]\n[Choice: I don't really think about it that much]",

Nothing at all?\"\n\n You can't help but roll your eyes. \"Why does this feel like an interrogation?\"\n\n Samantha taps her fingers against the table. \"Because it is.\"\n\n Luke nods. \"A friendly one, though. With good intentions.\"\n\n \"Look, I just know what I like,\" you say. \"That's all.\"\n\n Samantha hums thoughtfully. \"Okay, okay. Fair enough.\" She pauses, then smirks. \"Sooo, is there anyone specific?\"\n\n You groan. \"I am absolutely not answering that.\"\n\n \"That means there is someone!\" Luke says, letting out a loud laugh.\n\n Samantha gasps and scrambles to sit up straight. \"Oh my God, is it someone at school? Perhaps even someone we know?\"\n\n You glare. \"Not happening.\"\n\n \"Ugh,\" Samantha says, crossing her arms and pouting. \"You're no fun.\"\n\n Luke nudges your arm. \"Fine, we'll drop it.

This is new information. Interesting information.\"\n\n Luke nods enthusiastically. \"Yeah! I mean, you never talk about this stuff. So, naturally, we have a few follow-up questions.\"\n\n \"I regret everything,\" you mutter.\n\n Samantha ignores you completely. \"So, is this, like, a recent realization or have you just been keeping secrets from your two very best friends in the whole entire world?\"\n\n \"I just... never really thought it was that big of a deal,\" you say, shrugging.\n\n \"How dare you keep your nonexistent love life from us?\" Luke teases.\n\n Samantha snorts. \"Right? The betrayal.\"\n\n \"You two are the worst,\" you say, struggling to hold back a small smile.\n\n Luke smiles. \"And yet, here you are, still sitting with us.\"\n\n \"Oh, last question!\" Samantha announces. \"Is there anyone in particular?\"\n\n You scoff. \"Yeah, I'm not answering that.\"\n\n Samantha lets out a dramatic sigh. \"Boo.\"\n\n Luke just grins. \"Fair. We'll get it out of you eventually though.\"\n\n \n You hesitate for a second, then shrug. \"I mean... both?\"\n\n There's a brief pause—just long enough for you to wonder if you should've phrased it differently—before Samantha's lips curl into a smug grin. \"Ohhh. How... interesting.\"\n\n Luke, on the other hand, looks delighted. \"Dude, that's awesome!\"\n\n \"Why do you sound so excited?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n \"I dunno,\" Luke responds, shrugging. \"It's just cool. Variety is the sugar and spice and everything nice of life, or whatever they say.\"\n\n Samantha tilts her head. \"Yeah, I mean, it makes sense. I've always said you have mildly chaotic energy.\"\n\n You blink. \"What does that have to do with anything?\"\n\n \"I'm just saying it tracks,\" Samantha says, smirking.\n\n Luke leans forward, his eyes meeting yours. \"Okay, so follow-up question.\"\n\n \"I knew this was coming,\" you murmur.\n\n Samantha waves a hand. \"Oh, come on. We're your best friends, [name]. Naturally, we need to know the specifics.\"\n\n Luke grins. \"Yeah, like, do you lean one way or is it a full 50/50 situation?\"\n\n You groan. \"Why does this feel like a press conference?\"\n\n Samantha rests her chin on her palm. \"Because we're very interested.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but can't help the small chuckle that escapes your lips. \"I don't know. I haven't exactly done research on it.\"\n\n \"Sounds like a fun experiment, not gonna lie,\" Luke says, a wide grin plastered on his face.\n\n \"Exactly, it would be very educational,\" Samantha adds.\n\n You shake your head. \"I hate both of you.\"\n\n Luke laughs. \"Nah, you love us.\"\n\n Samantha smirks. \"And you're stuck with us, so you might as well accept it.\"\n\n \n You pause, considering your words, then shrug. \"I don't really think about it that much, to be honest.\"\n\n Samantha raises an eyebrow, tilting her head. \"Huh.\"\n\n Luke slows down mid-bite. \"Like... at all?\"\n\n You shake your head. \"Not really. I mean, sure, people talk about crushes and dating and whatever, but I've never felt it was a huge deal. I guess I just have other stuff on my mind.\"\n\n \"So, [name], what you're saying is...\" She leans in slightly. \"While the rest of us have been suffering through high school drama, messy breakups, and bad crushes, you've just been vibing?\"\n\n Luke blinks. \"Kind of jealous, honestly.\"\n\n \"I don't know, Luke,\" you say, smirking. \"I've seen you mope over people before. I'm not sure I'd want that experience.\"\n\n He groans and shoves his face into his hands. \"One time.\"\n\n \"It was not one time,\" Samantha corrects, snorting.\n\n \"Okay, fine, maybe two times,\" Luke protests. \"Point is, [name]'s living the stress-free life, and I respect it.\"\n\n Samantha crosses her arms. \"Yeah, but now I'm curious. You've never thought about it? Like, no crushes? No 'oh that person is kinda cute' moments?\"\n\n You groan, trying to think back. \"I mean... sure, I've noticed when people are attractive, I guess. But I've never really wanted to do anything about it.\"\n\n \"Fair enough,\" Samantha says, shrugging. \"Love is a scam anyway.\"\n\n Luke looks at her. \"Didn't you have a crush on—\"\n\n She kicks him under the table. \"Irrelevant information.\"\n\n \"Duly noted.\"\n\n \"I'm glad to see I'm missing out on so much,\" you say.\n \n\nYou shake your head. Despite their relentless teasing, there's something oddly reassuring about the whole thing. Just another dumb conversation, another normal lunch with your best friends.\n\nAnd honestly?

As you step into the auditorium, the scent of old wood and dust fills the air, the dimmed stage lights humming faintly overhead.\n\nMost of the class is already milling around, chatting in small groups or flipping through the script. The room feels charged in a way that it simply wasn't last class, probably because today is the day Mr. Bennet really starts to dive into Romeo and Juliet.\n\nYou glance around and spot Jordan toward the back of the room, leaning against a row of seats with his arms crossed. There's a sharp focus in his expression, as if he's bracing himself for whatever's coming.\n\nBefore you can think too much about it, the doors swing open, and Mr. Bennet strides in with his usual theatrical flair. His scarf—he always wears a scarf—is draped over one shoulder, and he claps his hands together with the enthusiasm of a man who knows he's about to change lives.\n\n\"Ah, my dear aspiring performers!\" he announces, his voice effortlessly carrying through the auditorium. \"I trust you've all done your reading?\"\n\nA few students murmur half-hearted confirmations, while others exchange guilty glances, clearly hoping they won't be called out.\n\nMr. Bennet sighs dramatically, placing a hand over his heart. \"Oh, the tragedy of unread Shakespeare! The injustice done to The Bard of Avon himself! But fear not, for today, we shall redeem ourselves.\" His eyes sweep over the class. \"Let's see who truly absorbed the poetry of young love and fatal misunderstandings.\"\n\nHe spins on his heel, his scarf trailing behind him. \"We will begin with a simple exercise. I want you all to think about the story so far—the love, the feuds, the tension! And now... I want you to describe Romeo and Juliet in just one word.\"\n\nHe pauses for effect before gesturing broadly. \"Be bold! Be honest!

He clutches his scarf dramatically, spinning on his heel to face you fully. \"Overdramatic\" he repeats, eyes wide with horror. \"My dear student, you wound me.\"\n\n \"I mean, come on,\" you begin. \"They meet, they fall in love in one night, and they make the worst decisions possible. Then boom, double tragedy. It's a lot.\"\n\n Your drama teacher exhales through his nose, pacing the stage and snapping his fingers as he gathers himself. \"Yes, yes, I see now. You are the practical sort. The kind who watches a grand romantic gesture and says, 'Well, that was unnecessary.'\" He shakes his head. \"A tragic condition.\"\n\n Some students laugh.\n\n Mr. Bennet isn't done though. He turns to you, pointing with dramatic intent. \"And yet! Isn't life itself overdramatic? Are we not creatures of passion and impulse? Do we not all make reckless choices in the name of love, of anger, of fate?\"\n\n \"I mean, yeah, but I don't think most people take it to that level.\"\n\n \"Ah, but isn't that what makes it theater?\" he counters, eyes gleaming. \"We do not come to the stage for the reasonable or the logical—we come for the heightened! The exaggerated! The spectacular!\" He throws his arms out.\n\n A few students even clap at the performance he's putting on.\n \n \"A fair answer, [name],\" Mr. Bennet says after collecting himself. \"Perhaps a skeptical one, but fair.\"\n\n With that, he sweeps his gaze across the room. \"Who else dares challenge the magnitude of this story?\"\n\n You shake your head, biting back a smile as he moves on. Maybe Romeo and Juliet is ridiculous—but at least Mr. Bennet makes talking about it entertaining.\n\n \n \n You think for a second before giving the most honest answer you can. \"Tragic.\"\n\n From across the room, Jordan—who had been leaning back in his seat, arms crossed like he wasn't paying attention—actually nods.\n\n Mr. Bennet, however, lets out an exaggerated sigh, as if your response physically pains him. He presses a hand to his chest, pacing the stage like he's carrying the weight of Shakespeare's sorrow himself. \"Tragic,\" he repeats, drawing out the word like it's poetry. \"Yes, yes, of course. How cruel the world is! How unforgiving!\"\n\n A few students chuckle, but you just raise an eyebrow and wait for him to get to his point.\n\n He spins on his heel, leveling you with an intense gaze. \"And tell me, [name]—why is it tragic?\" He gestures dramatically. \"Is it the foolishness of youth? The bitter grip of fate? The wretched feuding of their families?\"\n\n \"All of it, really,\" you say, shrugging. \"It's not just that Romeo and Juliet die—it's that they never had a chance. Everything was against them from the start. They thought love was enough, but it didn't matter in the end. The world still tore them apart.\"\n\n There's a beat of silence. Then, from the back of the room, Jordan speaks.\n\n \"Exactly.\"\n\n It's the first time he's said anything this whole class.\n\n You glance over at him. He doesn't elaborate, opting to just shift slightly in his seat, but his expression is more thoughtful than usual—like he's been waiting for someone else to say it first.\n\n Mr. Bennet, meanwhile, looks delighted. \"Oh, excellent!\" He gestures wildly, nearly sending his scarf flying. \"Yes! That is the true tragedy! The inescapable weight of destiny! The cruel hands of the universe closing around them, no matter how hard they fight!\" He spins, addressing the whole class now. \"And that is why this play has lasted centuries! Because deep down, we all know what it is like to be powerless against forces beyond our control.\"\n\n There's a murmur of interest across the room, though some students still look checked out. Jordan, however, leans forward slightly, his eyes lingering on the stage.\n\n Mr. Bennet turns back to you, nodding. \"An excellent answer, [name]. Painful, but excellent.\"\n\n He clasps his hands together, surveying the room. \"Now, who dares to disagree?\"\n\n As he moves on, you steal a quick glance toward Jordan. He's already looking away, but there's the faintest ghost of a smirk on his face.\n\n Maybe theater class won't be so bad after all.\n\n \n \n You think about it for a second, then say, \"Romantic.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet gasps, clasping his hands together. \"Ahh! Finally, someone who understands!\" He gestures wildly to the class. \"Yes! Love! Passion! Devotion! The grand, sweeping romance that has captured hearts for generations!\"\n\n A few students laugh, but from the back of the room, you catch the faintest reaction from Jordan—a slight tilt of his head, almost like he approves.\n\n Mr. Bennet is already in full performance mode. \"Some may call it foolish! Others may class it reckless. But I ask you, is there anything more compelling than the burning intensity of love at first sight?\" He spins dramatically before zeroing in on you again. \"Tell me, [name]—what about it speaks to you?\"\n\n \"I mean, yeah, it's reckless, but that's what makes it romantic,\" you say, shrugging. \"It's about that feeling of wanting someone so much that nothing else even matters. Romeo and Juliet know it's dangerous, but they do it anyway.\"\n\n Jordan shifts slightly, fingers tapping against his knee. He doesn't say anything, but you can tell he's thinking.\n\n Mr. Bennet, meanwhile, looks delighted. \"Yes, yes, yes! That is the heart of it! Love is not reasonable! It does not wait! It does not ask permission! It consumes and devours!\"\n\n A few students murmur in amusement.\n\n \"You, [name], see the beauty of it,\" Mr. Bennet states. \"You understand that romance—true, overwhelming romance—is not a slow, careful thing. It is madness! It is fate!\"\n\n He grins, clearly pleased. \"A fine answer, my dear student. A very fine answer indeed.\"\n\n You can't help but smile too. Mr. Bennet's theatrics have at least made every class memorable.\n\n \n \n You don't even have to think about it. You exhale and mutter, \"Stupid.\"\n\n The reaction is immediate.\n\n Mr. Bennet clutches his chest like you just stabbed him through the heart. A dramatic, tortured gasp escapes his lips as he staggers back, nearly tripping over his own oversized scarf. \"Stupid?\" he repeats, his voice dripping with despair. \"Oh, cruel fate, to hear such blasphemy spoken in my very own classroom.\"\n\n The class chuckles, but not everyone is amused. From the back of the room, you feel a sharp, disapproving glare burning into you.\n\n Jordan.\n\n You glance his way, and yeah, he looks mad. His arms crossed and jaws clenched, it's clear he didn't like your answer.\n\n Nr. Bennet, meanwhile, is still mid-breakdown. \"[name], my poor misguided soul, please tell me—what about this timeless masterpiece has led you to such grievous misjudgment?\"\n\n \"I mean, come on,\" you begin. \"They meet, they talk for maybe five minutes, and suddenly, it's the most intense love in history? Then they die because neither of them knows how to just stop and think for two seconds? It's really dumb.\"\n\n A few students snicker, but Mr. Bennet looks like he might actually faint. He rubs his temples, muttering something about \"the youth of today\" and \"Shakespeare weeps.\"\n\n And Jordan? He scoffs. Loudly.\n\n You glance back at him, but he doesn't even try to hide his distaste. \"You don't get it,\" he mutters, shaking his head.\n\n It's the most emotion you've ever heard from him in class.\n\n Mr. Bennet, still looking deeply disappointed, sighs and straightens up. \"My dear [name], while I deeply mourn your take, I must commend your conviction. Even if it is entirely incorrect.\"\n\n \"Now! Before I descend into despair, let us hear from someone who still has a soul.\"\n\n The class moves on, but you can feel Jordan's irritation lingering in the air.\n\n You'll have to deal with that at some point.\n\n \n \n You think for a moment before settling on your answer. \"Fate.\"\n\n From the back of the room, Jordan shifts slightly. You don't even have to look to know he's listening.\n\n Mr. Bennet's expression immediately brightens. \"Yes!\" he exclaims, eyes gleaming with approval. \"A believer in the grand design! In destiny! In the invisible hands that shape our lives!\"\n\n \"I mean, that's kind of the whole point of the play, isn't it?\" you ask. \"No matter what Romeo and Juliet do, things are already set in motion. They don't choose tragedy—it was always going to happen.\"\n\n Jordan speaks before Mr. Bennet can.\n\n \"Exactly.\"\n\n You glance toward him, and for once, there's something thoughtful in his expression—like he actually respects your answer.\n\n Mr. Bennet, now fully in his element, gestures dramatically. \"Ah, the cruel hands of destiny! The lovers, star-crossed from the very beginning! Do they control their own fates, or were they doomed from the moment they met?\" He turns back to you, pointing. \"Tell me, [name]—do you believe in fate?\"\n\n You hesitate, caught off guard. \"I don't know.\"\n\n \"An honest answer,\" Mr. Bennet states, smiling knowingly before turning to the rest of the class. \"Whether we believe in it or not, fate is inescapable in the world of Shakespeare! And that, my dear students, is what makes this story so powerful!\"\n\n He claps his hands, moving on to the next student. You let out a quiet breath, glad you handled things well.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Just a reading. The goal? To feel the rhythm, the passion, and the weight of the words on your tongue!\"\n\nA few students exchange nervous glances.\n\nMr. Bennet waves a hand. \"You may choose your own partners for now. But be warned! Chemistry, my dear students, matters!\"\n\nYou barely have time to process that before people start moving. Some rush to their best friends, while others linger. You glance around the room, weighing your options.\n\nYou glance toward Jordan first.\n\nHe hasn't moved yet, still sitting at the back of the room, arms crossed, gaze flicking toward the stage like he's running through lines in his head. He looks deep in thought, but not in his usual way—more like he's debating something. Maybe about who to work with. Maybe about the scene itself. Or maybe about how much he hates being in a room full of people.\n\nYou could approach him. He might say yes. Or he might glare at you. Hard to tell.\n\nThen, your gaze shifts to someone else.\n\nNear the middle of the room, a girl stands alone, gripping a copy of the script with both hands like it's a lifeline. She flips through the pages quickly—too quickly, like she's not actually reading, but moving to keep herself occupied. Her hair falls over her face slightly, and she tugs at the sleeve of her oversized sweater, shifting her weight from foot to foot.\n\nShe looks... nervous.\n\nLike she's waiting for someone to ask her to pair up but doesn't quite have the courage to make the first move.\n\nYou have two options.\n\n[Choice: Jordan]\n[Choice: The nervous girl]",

Students settle into their seats or drift toward corners to whisper about who nailed it and who flopped. Scripts rustle. Feet shuffle. A few kids laugh nervously, not quite sure whether to feel proud or doomed.\n\nMr. Bennet claps once. Loud. Sharp.\n\nThe entire room stills.\n\nHe steps into the center of the performance floor like the world is his stage—his ever-present scarf trailing dramatically behind him, binder hugged to his chest like it contains sacred scrolls.\n\n\"Brilliant,\" he says, taking in the group. \"Some of you,\" he adds, eyes narrowing slightly, \"are beginning to truly listen to the words. To feel them. To let them breathe.\"\n\nHe smiles, and though it's genuine, there's a glint of warning behind it.\n\n\"Others,\" he says, \"are still treating this like a class presentation.\" His eyes land on a boy in the back row who immediately averts his gaze.\n\nMr. Bennet walks to the foot of the stage and drops his binder on the chair with a heavy thump.\n\n\"Now, listen closely, because this next part is very important.\" He clasps his hands, posture straightening like a king issuing a decree. \"This week is what I call the funnel. All the play's pieces, all the potential, all the little bursts of brilliance I saw today—they get narrowed. Sharpened. Defined.\"\n\nHe paces in front of the stage, voice steady. \"Auditions will happen by next week. Which means everything you say, everything you do, will be watched very, very closely.\"\n\nA few students sit up straighter.\n\n\"I will not simply cast based on who speaks the loudest,\" he continues. \"I am watching how you listen. How you react. What choices you make when the spotlight is not on you.\" He sweeps his arm dramatically. \"So be bold. Be specific. Be present.\"\n\nThen, a sudden pause. Mr. Bennet raises a single finger.\n\n\"Before I make any decisions though, I want to know you. Not your characters. You.\"\n\n\"I will be calling each of you, one at a time, to speak with me privately,\" Mr. Bennet continues. \"I want to hear what role you see yourself in, and why.\"\n\nSomeone mutters under her breath, \"It's like a therapy session.\"\n\nMr. Bennet smiles, having heard it. \"Precisely. Consider it emotional dramaturgy.\"\n\nA few students chuckle, but most of the room shifts with nervous anticipation. You're not sure if you'll be called early or late, but a conversation with your drama teacher is inevitable.\n\nHe claps his hands again. \"Until your name is called, feel free to review your scripts, run lines, or rehearse—quietly. No TikToks. No sword fights. And for heaven's sake, do not set the curtain on fire. I already dealt with that last year.\"\n\nYou're not sure if the last part is a joke.\n\nMr. Bennet makes his way to a small desk near the side of the auditorium stage, pulls a chair next to it, and sits. Then he looks up and says the first name.\n\nIt's not yours.\n\nYou've got a little time.\n\n[Choice: Wait]",

One girl is pacing and mouthing her monologue with intense concentration. Another group is clearly trying to rehearse but keeps breaking into laughter.\n\nYou keep glancing at Mr. Bennet. With every name he calls, your chest tightens a little more. One by one, he speaks to each student briefly, sometimes for a few seconds, sometimes for minutes. He always stands after, scribbling something into his binder and waving the next person over without fanfare.\n\nAnd then:\n\n\"[name].\"\n\nYou look up. His tone isn't sharp, but it carries weight—heavier than usual. There's no dramatic flourish this time, no exaggerated bow or teasing grin. He gestures with two fingers toward the chair beside his.\n\nThe auditorium noise fades into a distant hum as you rise. Each step toward him feels unusually loud, your shoes echoing against the floor. The closer you get, the more you realize that he's not performing right now.\n\nThis is Mr. Bennet without the scarf-waving, spotlight-loving grandeur. And that's a lot worse.\n\nYou sit. The chair creaks slightly under you. Mr. Bennet doesn't move for a long moment. His binder is closed. His eyes are on you. And he looks... tired, maybe. Or just deeply, deeply focused.\n\nHe doesn't speak right away. Doesn't even offer a greeting.\n\nWhen he finally does speak, his voice is quieter—controlled, serious.\n\n\"You showed something today.\"\n\nYou blink. It's not a compliment. It's more like... a diagnosis.\n\n\"This isn't just a class for me,\" he continues, calm and low. \"I don't care about reciting lines. I care about finding out who someone becomes when they step into something bigger than themselves.\"\n\nThe silence that follows that sentence is long.\n\nThen—\n\n\"So.\" He folds his hands over the binder. \"What role do you want?\"\n\nThere's no wink. No cheeky smile. No playful teasing.\n\nJust the question.\n\nThe kind that feels like it matters.\n\nWhatever you say here—he's going to believe in you.\n\n[Choice: I want Romeo's role]\n[Choice: I want Juliet's role]\n[Choice: I want a supporting role]\n[Choice: I want to be backstage]\n[Choice: I don't know yet]",

Measuring it. Testing the shape of it against the shape of you.\n\n His gaze isn't unkind, but it is sharp, and it holds longer than you expect.\n\n You shift slightly in your seat, hyperaware of your posture and the way your shirt falls. You've gotten used to people looking at you with a certain kind of curiosity lately—trying to figure you out without saying so.\n\n But Mr. Bennet doesn't look confused or surprised.\n\n Just focused.\n\n \"I see,\" he finally says, voice calm. \"Tell me why.\"\n\n You take a deep breath before starting. \"I want to play someone who feels everything. Who rushes into things not because he's reckless or anything, but because he has to.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet doesn't interrupt.\n\n \"Romeo gets written off as dramatic or weak. But I don't think he is. If anything, I think he's brave. He just... feels things so deeply, so completely, that he doesn't always know what to do with it. And when he finally finds something real, he throws himself at it.\"\n\n You pause, then add, \"That makes sense to me.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet watches you with that same stillness. You're used to people seeing Romeo as a type—charming, straightforward, traditionally masculine. You know what you look like. And you know it's not what most people picture when they imagine him.\n\n But he doesn't question it. Doesn't ask if you're sure. Doesn't raise an eyebrow or give you a patronizing smile.\n\n He just nods. Slowly.\n\n \"Romeo has always been cast as a boy standing on the edge of manhood,\" he says. \"But maybe that's never what he was. Maybe he's just someone searching for who he's allowed to be.\"\n\n Your breath catches a little at that.\n\n Mr. Bennet leans back, arms crossed loosely. \"If I give you the role, I won't ask you to perform masculinity for the sake of comfort. I won't want some hollow echo of a romantic lead. I'll want you. As you are. If that's something you can give.\"\n\n \"It is,\" you promise.\n\n He holds your gaze for a beat longer, then picks up his pen and jots something into his binder.\n\n \"Thank you, [name].\"\n\n You rise. The moment lingers in your chest as you walk back across the auditorium.\n\n He won't ask you to change, but he will ask you to show up.\n\n And you will.\n \n \n Mr. Bennet studies you for a moment longer. Then, he leans back in his chair, just slightly, and nods once. \"Romeo.\"\n\n He says it like he's trying the word out, testing how it fits around you—not as a judgment, but as a challenge.\n\n \"You know,\" he says slowly, \"most students who ask for Romeo want him for the wrong reasons. They see him as the lead, the star, the tragic heartthrob who dies for love. They want the stage, not the soul.\"\n\n He tilts his head, sharp gaze locked on yours. \"That's not why you want him.\"\n\n It's not a question. It's a statement.\n\n \"It's not about being the lead,\" you begin, not sure how to even explain it all. \"I just... I connect with him. I get it—feeling too much, too fast. Saying something before you understand what it really means. Screwing it all up because you couldn't slow down.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet says nothing, but his eyes soften.\n\n \"I don't think Romeo's weak,\" you continue. \"I think he's just young. He feels things hard, and maybe he's impulsive, but he means it every time. He means everything.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet lets the silence stretch for a beat longer, then murmurs. \"He burns too hot and too fast.\" He taps a finger once on his binder. \"And yet... he changes. From Rosaline to Juliet. From childish romance to something terrifyingly real.\"\n\n You nod. \"He grows, yeah, but not enough. I guess that's what makes him tragic.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet leans forward again, hands folded and voice quiet.\n\n \"You look like someone people expect to play Romeo,\" he says, not unkindly. \"And that means something on stage. But what really makes a good Romeo—what makes an honest one—doesn't come from your build.\"\n\n \"If I give you the part, I don't want you to play it safe,\" your drama teacher states. \"I want your version. The real version. Messy. Sincere. The boy who wants so badly to do the right thing, but keeps falling short.\"\n\n You swallow, your pulse loud in your ears.\n\n \"Think you can do that, [name]?\" he asks.\n\n You nod. \"Yeah, I think I can.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet watches you for a beat longer, then reaches for his pen and jots something down in his binder. His voice softens. \"Alright. Thank you.\"\n \n You take that as your cue.\n\n Rising from the chair, you glance back only once. He's already calling the next name.\n\n But you don't need him to say anything else.\n\n He heard you.\n \n\n \n \n \n You say it.\n\n \"I want to play Juliet.\"\n\n The words echo in the air for a moment longer than they should. Not because Mr. Bennet didn't hear you, but because he's weighing it carefully.\n\n <<if [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n \"You know what that means, don't you?\" he says softly. \"Choosing her.\"\n\n You nod. You don't even flinch.\n\n Because you do know.\n\n You've caught the stares in the hallway. The subtle comments. The uncertainty in people's eyes when they look at you now—like they're trying to place you in a box that no longer fits. You've watched your reflection change over the past two weeks into something softer, rounder, and unfamiliar.\n\n Choosing Juliet isn't about spectacle. It's not even about gender. It's about... resonance.\n\n \"I know,\" you respond. \"But I don't think I've ever connected with a character the way I do with her.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet nods slowly. \"She's so often played as fragile. Porcelain. A girl who falls in love and dies for it. But she's not that.\"\n\n \"She's like fire,\" you say. \"Quiet fire. She knows what she's giving up and she makes that choice with clarity and strength.\"\n\n His gaze sharpens, just slightly. You can feel the test in it—not a challenge, not a \"prove it.\" Just a quiet: Are you ready for this?\n\n And you are.\n\n You continue, voice steadier now. \"I want to show people that Juliet's strength comes not from loud speeches or showy movements, but in how she holds herself. How she stands up to everyone around her—not by force, but by being sure of what she wants.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet is silent for a moment. Then, almost more to himself, he murmurs, \"A Juliet who doesn't bend. She chooses.\"\n\n \"There will be eyes on you,\" he says, his voice thoughtful. \"People who want to read a statement into every breath you take on stage. I won't shield you from that.\"\n\n You sit with that. Let it settle. Then, you say, \"I'm not asking to be protected. I don't want to be protected. I'm asking to be seen.\"\n\n That lands.\n\n Mr. Bennet exhales through his nose, picks up his pen, and scribbles something carefully into his binder. Then he closes it.\n\n \"Thank you, [name],\" he says, meeting your eyes one last time.\n\n You rise. As you walk back across the auditorium floor, the room buzzes faintly around you—students practicing, whispering, waiting.\n\n But it all feels far away.\n\n Because right now, one thing is clear:\n\n You asked for Juliet.\n\n And you meant every word.\n \n \n Then he leans forward, resting his elbows on the binder in his lap. His voice is quieter now, more serious than dramatic.\n\n \"Juliet,\" he repeats, like he's making sure you said it for the right reason. \"Not for shock value or to prove something. You mean it.\"\n\n You nod. \"Yeah, I do.\"\n\n He watches you, not with skepticism, but with a kind of measured curiosity. His eyes flicker—once, briefly—down your posture, your frame, your shoulders. You still look like a guy. Still read that way.\n\n And you know exactly how it sounds—for a guy who looks like you do to ask for that part.\n\n But he doesn't ask you to explain yourself. Not yet. He just waits.\n\n So you take a breath and say, \"She's not just the girl in the window. She's smart. Brave. She sees all the ways the world is trying to control her, and she chooses anyway. She knows what love costs, and she walks into it with her eyes open.\"\n\n You pause.\n\n \"She's not passive. She's powerful. I want to honor it.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet lets out a slow exhale, and for once, he doesn't leap into some grand monologue.\n\n \"A boy playing Juliet will draw attention,\" he admits. \"That's inevitable. And I won't cast someone in that role unless I know they're ready for what it'll mean—on and off the stage.\"\n\n Your chest tightens slightly, but you nod. \"I know.\"\n\n \"Do you?\" he asks. \"Because this won't be easy. Not with how you present. Some people will call it brave. Others will call it something else.\"\n\n You hold his gaze, unwilling to waver. \"I'm not doing it for them.\"\n\n Something shifts in his expression. Not surprise—just quiet understanding.\n\n He leans back, opens his binder, and writes something slowly.\n\n When he finishes, he looks up one last time. \"If I give you Juliet, I won't expect you to be anything other than what you are. But I will expect you to mean every word you say.\"\n\n \"I can do that,\" you promise.\n\n He nods. \"Thank you, [name].\"\n\n You stand. As you walk back into the soft hum of the auditorium, the words still hang in your chest like an anchor and a promise at once.\n\n Juliet.\n\n Something about her already feels like a part of you.\n \n\n \n \"I'd like a supporting role, to be honest,\" you mutter.\n\n Mr. Bennet tilts his head slightly at your answer.\n\n \"A supporting role.\"\n\n He repeats it, not to question you, but to feel the weight of it. Then he leans back in his chair, fingers steepled under his chin.\n\n <<if [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n \"You're not the first student to say that,\" he says, folding his hands over his binder. \"But you might be one of the few who actually mean it.\"\n\n You feel his eyes glance over you—not in a judgmental; way, but in that assessing, theatrical way he has. Taking in the softness of your features. He doesn't comment on it. He doesn't need to. You can tell he's already adjusting his mental casting map.\n\n \"I take it you're not gunning for Juliet,\" he says, voice even, not teasing.\n\n You shake your head. \"I'm not against it. I just... think there are other places I'd fit better. A role that adds to the story, not defines it.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet hums, flipping open his binder. \"Well, then. Let's talk options.\"\n\n His fingers trace a list of names. 'There's the nurse,\" he says. \"She's bold, funny, deeply emotional—and the last voice of reason before things fall apart.\"\n\n \"Seriously?\" you ask.\n\n \"She's more than comic relief, [name],\" Mr. Bennet states, raising an eyebrow. \"She's one of the few characters in the play who loves Juliet without condition. And she's very protective. She's lived a life. That can be played with depth.\"\n\n You nod slowly, a little surprised by his words.\n\n \"There's also Lady Capulet,\" he continues. \"Underused in most productions. But there's weight there. Anger, grief, class pressure. She's complicated. Easy to play flat. Difficult to play human.\"\n\n You sit with that. The idea of playing a mother feels strange but not wrong.\n\n Mr. Bennet picks up his pen and scribbles something slowly into the margin of his notes.\n \n \n \"Not everyone's drawn to the center,\" he says. \"Some of the strongest performances I've ever directed came from the second row—the ones who listen, who react, who hold the scene in place while the leads burn hot.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I don't need to be the one delivering the big speeches,\" you say. \"I just want to be part of something that matters.\"\n\n There's a flicker of something that looks like approval in his eyes.\n\n \"Very fair,\" he says. \"And given how you present, you'll be considered for the traditional male roles.\"\n\n He flips open his binder, scanning a page with quick, practiced eyes.\n\n \"Mercutio,\" he murmurs. \"That's the obvious one. He's loud, reckless, and loyal to a fault. The kind of character who explodes into a scene and steals it if the actor knows how to walk that edge.\"\n\n He looks back up at you.\n\n \"You could do it,\" he says simply. \"But he's not easy. Mercutio hides a lot behind that wit.\"\n\n You nod, thoughtful. \"Yeah, I've always liked him. He's messy, but he's honest in his own way.\"\n\n \"Precisely,\" Mr. Bennet replies. \"And then there's Benvolio. He's quieter, calmer. The peacekeeper. Often overlooked, but crucial to the story's balance.\"\n\n \"I'll keep both in mind,\" you say.\n\n You shift in your seat slightly, and he notices. \"A supporting role is not what most people ask for. But then again, most people don't know what they want. You do.\"\n\n He closes the binder gently.\n \n\n \"Supporting roles aren't lesser roles, [name]. They're just... steadier. And this show needs steady.\"\n\n \"I'm good with that,\" you say.\n\n Mr. Bennet writes something down and then looks back up at you with a smile.\n\n \"Thank you,\" he says. \"You can head back.\"\n\n You rise and return to the rows of auditorium chairs, passing the stage lights and worn curtains. You may not be at the center, but you are part of the story. And sometimes, that's where the real weight lives.\n\n \n \n \n \"Honestly, I think I'd rather help backstage,\" you admit.\n\n Mr. Bennet's eyes don't immediately react when you say it. There's no flicker of disapproval or a dramatic sigh. Just stillness.\n\n But after a few moments, he leans back in his chair, fingertips tapping gently against his binder. \"I see.\"\n\n He doesn't say anything else right away. The silence stretches—not awkwardly, but heavily. And for the first time in class, you feel the absence of his usual energy.\n\n Then, finally, he speaks—his voice lower, more serious than usual. \"You know,\" he says. \"I see a lot of students come through this program wanting the lead. Wanting lines and applause, the rush of the spotlight.\"\n\n He pauses. \"None of them have impressed me the way you did today.\"\n\n \"I'm not saying I didn't like it,\" you offer. \"I just... I don't know if I'm ready to be up there. Not like that.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet nods slowly. He's not disappointed in you—he's disappointed for you.\n\n Yet, despite that, he doesn't push.\n\n \"It takes a different kind of strength,\" he says, \"to admit you're not ready for something. Or that you'd rather be useful in a quieter way.\"\n\n He flips open the binder, pen in hand, but doesn't write anything just yet.\n\n \"Backstage is the heart of a play,\" he says, almost reverent now. \"Costumes, props, lighting, cues—all of it is invisible until it fails. And when it doesn't? That's when it's magic.\"\n\n You manage a small smile.\n\n He meets your eyes again. \"I won't stop you from stepping back, [name]. I won't try to drag you into something you're not ready for. But I do hope...\" He pauses, thoughtful. \"I do hope you keep your heart open to it. Because I've seen what you're capable of. And I'd hate for you to bury it.\"\n\n \"Thanks, Mr. Bennet.\"\n\n He nods, finally jotting something down.\n\n \"Costume, prop, or tech team—you can decide later,\" he states. \"We'll find a place for you.\"\n\n You rise, taking one last glance at the stage as you walk away.\n\n It's strange. You don't feel like you failed. Not at all. Just... like you're waiting for the right moment to step forward.\n\n And for now? You'll help build something behind the curtain.\n\n Because maybe, in your own time, the spotlight will be waiting.\n\n \n \"I... don't know yet,\" you have to admit.\n\n Mr. Bennet doesn't react right away, letting the words hang there for a second. You almost regret saying them. Not because they're untrue, but because they feel small in a space like this. Everyone else has probably marched in here with a character in mind. A goal. A dream. And you?\n\n You're still figuring out what all of this even means to you.\n\n But Mr. Bennet doesn't scoff. Doesn't raise an eyebrow or give you one of those disappointed teacher sighs.\n\n Instead, he nods once, slowly. Then closes his binder gently, as if making space for the conversation to shift.\n\n \"That might be the most honest thing anyone's told me all day.'\n\n You blink.\n\n He leans forward just slightly, folding his hands. \"This is the part no one likes to talk about. The middle. The space between knowing and not knowing. The part where you're testing the weight of your own voice, deciding which parts of yourself are real—and which ones were just borrowed from someone else's expectations.\"\n\n You don't say anything.\n\n \"I don't expect everyone to talk in here with answers,\" he continues. \"I expect you to look. To try. To probe at things that feel strange and uncomfortable. And if something calls to you? You listen.\"\n\n You nod slowly, the breath you'd been holding finally slipping out. \"I guess that's where I'm at. Trying to figure out what feels... right.\"\n\n His voice softens, not condescending, but kind. \"Then do that. Try the scenes. Read the lines that scare you a little. Stand next to the people who challenge you.\"\n\n He gives you a small smile. Not his usual wide theatrical grin—just a quiet one, real and steady.\n\n \"I'd rather work with someone who's searching than someone pretending they've already arrived.\"\n\n He opens his binder again and scribbles something in the margin—quick and casual. Not a verdict, but rather a note.\n\n \"Take your time,\" he says. \"You've still got time. Keep your ears open. Let the text pull you. And if something starts to feel like yours?\"\n\n He looks at you again. \"Do not be afraid to step into it.\"\n\n You nod. \"Thanks, Mr. Bennet.\"\n\n \"Thank you, [name].\"\n\n As you stand and walk back across the auditorium, you realize you don't need to know yet. But you're allowed to find out. And maybe, that's the most important part of all.\n \n\n[Choice: It's a wrap!]",

Their backpacks are slung low; they're already forgetting whatever assignments they were just given.\n\nBut not you.\n\nYou make your way to the school library instead, the familiar scent of old books and printer toner wrapping around you the moment you step inside. It's quiet—peaceful in a way most parts of the school never are. The kind of place where time stretches out just enough for you to breathe.\n\nYou head toward one of the long tables near the windows, flipping open your backpack to pull out your laptop.\n\nAnd then—\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\nYou glance up.\n\nVincent's standing near the end of the aisle, clutching a stack of books to his chest. His hair's a little messier than usual, like he ran a hand through it one too many times. There's a pencil tucked behind his ear. He's decided to participate in Pajama Day, wearing a faded graphic tee with a pixelated spaceship.\n\nBut it's his face that catches your notice.\n\nHe looks genuinely happy to see you. His whole expression lifts, like you're the last person he expected to run into—but exactly the one he wanted.\n\n\"I didn't think anyone else came here after class,\" he says, walking over with a nervous little laugh. \"Everyone always bolts like the school's on fire. Not that I blame them, but...\" He trails off, shrugging. \"Hi.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" you say, smiling. \"What are you working on?\"\n\nVincent glances down at the books in his arms. \"History. I started with French diplomacy, but then I found this book about Rasputin—the Rasputin—and did you know he survived being poisoned, shot, and thrown into this freezing river before he finally died? Like, it's actually insane! I ended up down this whole rabbit hole about how people used to think he had mystical powers, but really it was just adrenaline and, like, sheer stubborn weirdness. Anyway.\"\n\nHe stops, suddenly aware of how much he's talking. \"Sorry. I get... into it.\"\n\nYou chuckle. \"So, the usual.\"\n\nVincent hesitates, shifting on his feet, then blurts. \"Do you wanna study together?\" He adds quickly, \"Only if you want to! No pressure! I just thought—\"\n\nHe trails off, eyes darting away like he's already regretting asking. He clutches his books a little tighter, knuckles pale. \"I mean, you probably have your own system or whatever. And I talk a lot. Some people say too much. So it's fine if not.\"\n\nHe forces a small laugh, too quick to be real. \"I usually study alone anyway.\"\n\nYou can tell he's trying to sound like it doesn't matter. Like this was just an offhand suggestion, not something he actually worked up the courage to ask. But there's this flicker in his expression—gone almost as soon as it appears. Not quite hope, but something close. Something you've seen before.\n\nAnd now the choice is yours.\n\n[Choice: Yeah, I'd like that]\n[Choice: Maybe another time]",

She's wearing a hoodie that might've once been yours and a pair of beat-up pajama pants. Her wolfcut is a little messier than usual, black strands falling into her eyes, and she's chewing on a lollipop stick.\n\n You pause halfway up the steps.\n\n \"Took you long enough,\" she says, not moving.\n\n You blink. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n She shrugs. \"Chilling. Waiting. Whatever.\"\n\n \"Waiting for me?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow as you climb the steps.\n\n She rolls her eyes like it's a stupid question, then gestures to the empty spot. \"Come on, don't be weird, [name]. Just sit.\"\n\n You drop your backpack and sit beside her. She doesn't say anything right away, opting to just stare out at the street, the sky dark. There's the smell of someone's backyard grill in the distance, and for a second, it feels like summer again.\n\n Lily kicks her heel against the porch post a few times before finally saying, \"You've been weird lately.\"\n\n \"Gee, thanks,\" you say.\n\n \"No, not bad weird,\" she says. \"Just different. You're always leaving early and coming home late. You zone out all the time. And Mom's all like 'Give him space, he's a senior,' but...\" She shrugs. \"I don't know. You're still you, right, [name]?\"\n\n You stay quiet, not sure how to respond. Because, yeah—you have been different. You know it. But you didn't think she was paying attention.\n\n \n Lily kicks her heel against the porch post again, then glances sideways at you.\n\n \n \"I mean... you told me,\" she says, voice quieter now. \"A week ago, remember? I asked you what was up, and you just told me about the curse.\"\n \n \n \"I mean... you told me,\" she says, voice quieter now. \"A few days ago, remember? You kept coming home late, so I asked, and you just blurted it all out.\"\n \n \n <<if [acceptance] > 14>> \n \"I didn't really get it at first, to be honest,\" she admits. \"But I've been paying attention. You're changing, and it's clear it's not just on the outside.\"\n <<elseif [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n \"I didn't really get it at first, to be honest,\" she admits. \"But I've been paying attention. You're changing on the outside, and it's really obvious.\"\n \n \n \"I didn't really get it at first, to be honest,\" she admits. \"But I've been paying attention. I'm surprised you haven't changed more, you're still the same [name] I've always known.\"\n \n\n She pulls at the string on her hoodie sleeve. \"I figured if you needed to talk about it again, you would. But just so you know... I haven't forgotten. And I don't think it's weird at all. I think it's kinda brave, actually.\"\n\n You blink, not sure what you were expecting—but it wasn't that.\n\n Lily shrugs, trying to play it off. \"Anyway, all I'm saying is that I'm here if you want me.\"\n\n You nod slowly. \"Thanks, Lily.\"\n\n She bumps your shoulder with hers, and it's the kind of gesture that says more than she'll ever admit out loud. \"Of course, loser.\"\n\n The two of you sit in silence after that, just watching the neighborhood go still. Porch lights click on one by one. A few kids ride their bikes past, laughing. Somewhere, a sprinkler turns on.\n\n Lately, it really doesn't feel like you're figuring this out alone.\n \n \n \"I figured maybe you'd tell me when you were ready,\" she continues, pulling at a loose thread. \"But, like... if something's going on, I can listen. I'm not a baby.\"\n\n You look at her—really look. She's fourteen now, not the little kid who used to beg you to play video games or sneak snacks after bedtime. She's still stubborn, still fiery, still quick with sarcasm, still always one step ahead when you think she's not watching. But there's something steadier and more grown in her voice now.\n\n \"I don't need to know everything,\" she adds, voice softer. \"I just... wanna be there. You always looked out for me, y'know? I kinda wanna return the favor.\"\n\n Your chest aches a little, in that way it does when someone says something you didn't know you needed.\n\n You nod slowly. \"Thanks, Lily.\"\n\n She bumps your shoulder with hers. \"Of course, loser.\"\n\n The two of you sit in silence after that, just watching the neighborhood go still. Porch lights click on one by one. A few kids ride their bikes past, laughing. Somewhere, a sprinkler turns on.\n\n And even though you haven't said much—haven't explained anything—you feel a little lighter. \n \n\n \n When you round the corner and step into the front walk, you almost expect to see your sister, Lily, waiting for you on the porch. maybe with a snarky remark to say or a lollipop stick in her mouth.\n\n But the porch is empty.\n\n No Lily.\n\n You pause at the foot of the steps, adjusting your backpack as you take in the stillness of it all. She's probably inside. Probably in her room with her door shut and her music too loud. Or maybe she's at a friend's house. You wouldn't know. You haven't really talked in... a while.\n\n You head up the steps and sit on the porch. The wood creaks under your weight. The railing still has that little chip in it from when you were kids and dared each other to jump off it like superheroes.\n\n You stare at it now, and all you feel is distance.\n\n You and Lily used to be close. Not always, and certainly not perfectly, but enough. Enough to share dumb inside jokes and late-night snack runs and quiet little moments that didn't need explaining.\n\n But somewhere along the way you stopped reaching out. And she didn't exactly chase after you, either.\n\n Now, you're not sure if she'd even want to sit out here with you.\n\n You sigh, dragging a hand down your face.\n\n You've got enough on your plate already. But still, as you sit in the fading light, listening to the crickets and the distant hum of a passing car, you can't help but wonder:\n\n When did your little sister stop feeling like family, and start feeling like a stranger?\n \n\n[Choice: Another day comes to a close]",

You hesitate for a second, still getting used to the fact that you're actually wearing pajamas to school. It's not like you put any effort into it—you're still in the same clothes you slept in—but it feels weird to be walking outside like this.\n\n Luke is already waiting for you near the curb, rocking back and forth on his heels. His usual messy hair looks even worse than usual, sticking up at odd angles like he made zero effort to fix it. He's wearing a simple gray onesie, the kind with a hood and a zipper down the front. Paired with a pair of thick, soft slippers, he looks like the definition of cozy.\n\n The second he sees you, his face lights up. \"Oh my God, you actually dressed up!\" He grins like he just won a bet. \"I knew I'd get through to you!\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"You weren't the one who convinced me.\"\n\n Luke gasps, putting a hand to his chest. \"Are you, [name] Yoon, saying you chose to do this on your own?\"\n\n You shrug. \"It's just pajamas.\"\n\n He huffs. \"It's not just pajamas, [name]. It's a lifestyle.\" He gestures at himself. \"For example, look at me. Do I look stressed? No. Do I look like I'm about to have the most comfortable school day of my life? Absolutely.\"\n\n You chuckle. \"You look like you're five seconds away from falling asleep in class.\"\n\n \"Maybe, but that's a feature, not a bug,\" he states, clapping a hand on your shoulder as you start walking. \"See, this is good. You're learning. Participating. You'll thank me when you realize how amazing it is to exist in maximum comfort while suffering through math.\"\n\n By the time you arrive at school, you realize that Luke had a point. The whole place looks different—resembling more of a giant sleepover than a school. Everyone is in some kind of sleepwear, from soft flannel pants to oversized shirts, and a few people have gone all out with matching pajama sets or ridiculous onesies. Even some of the teachers are in on it, which is honestly the strangest part. Seeing your former history teacher in cat print pajamas? Definitely not something you were prepared for.\n\n Luke nudges you, a knowing smirk on his face. \"Come on, you've got to admit it. You're glad you dressed up.\"\n\n You exhale, shaking your head. \"I mean... it is comfortable.\"\n\n Luke gasps. \"I can't believe you're having character development.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but you can't help the small smile tugging at your lips. Maybe this day won't be so bad after all.\n\n \n When you step outside, the cool morning air hits your skin. Luke is already waiting for you at the edge of your driveway, shifting from foot to foot like he's got too much energy for this early in the morning. His usual messy hair looks even worse than usual, like he really did just roll out of bed without bothering to fix it.\n\n The first thing you notice is his onesie. It's not anything outrageous—just a simple gray one with a hood and a subtle pattern on the fabric. Comfortable but not over-the-top. He's even wearing ridiculously soft slippers instead of sneakers.\n\n The second thing you notice is the way his face twists in exaggerated disappointment the moment he sees you. His eyes drag over your very normal clothes and he groans, tilting his head back like the very sight is physically painful. \"[name]. No.\"\n\n You sigh. \"Good morning to you, too.\"\n\n Luke waves a hand at you. \"You didn't dress up.\"\n\n \"I know.\"\n\n \"Why?\" His voice isn't angry, just baffled, like you've personally wronged him. \"It's Pajama Day. The easiest theme day in existence. You do own pajamas, right? Right?\"\n\n You roll your eyes, adjusting the strap of your backpack over your shoulder. \"Obviously.\"\n\n Luke crosses his arms, exhaling through his nose. \"Then why. Are you. In normal clothes.\"\n\n \"Because I didn't feel like wearing pajamas to school?\" You realize you don't even sound convincing to yourself.\n\n He presses a hand over his heart like you told him you don't believe in happiness. \"Dude. You chose to wear real clothes when you could've stayed in the comfiest outfit possible? That's insane.\" He shakes his head. \"Not to mention tragic. Truly tragic.\"\n\n You snort, starting to walk. \"I think I'll survive, Luke.\"\n\n Luke groans again but doesn't push it further. He opts to tug his hood up over his head and shove his hands into his onesie's pockets. \"Just so you know, when people look at you weird all day, I reserve the right to say 'I told you so.' Repeatedly.\"\n\n \"Duly noted,\" you say dryly.\n\n By the time you get to school, it's clear Luke wasn't exaggerating. The second you step onto campus, you're hit with the sight of a sea of students in various states of comfort—flannel pants, oversized shirts, matching pajama sets, and a few fluffy robes. Even some of the teachers are participating. There's something about seeing your former history teacher in cat print pajamas that makes the whole thing feel surreal.\n\n Luke gives you a look but doesn't say anything. He doesn't have to. The told you so is written all over his face.\n\n You exhale through your nose, bracing yourself. It's going to be a long day.\n \n\n[Choice: Onward to homeroom!]",

But there's one person who doesn't look tired at all.\n\n Jessica.\n\n She's already at her desk, practically glowing, her usual confidence amplified by something lighter, something brighter. The moment she spots you, her whole face lights up. \"[name]!\" she says, beaming. \"There's my star performer.\"\n\n You snort, sliding into your seat. \"Alright, star performer is a bit of a stretch.\"\n\n \"Um, excuse you?\" She tilts her head dramatically. \"We killed it! The formations were sharp, the energy was insane, and tell me why I keep hearing people say we looked better than Riverview's squad?\" She leans in, a wide grin on her face. \"Because we did.\"\n\n She's not exaggerating. The routine was electric—each movement landing exactly where it needed to, every stunt going off without a hitch. For the first time, it felt like everything clicked.\n\n Jessica sighs happily, leaning back in her chair. \"I was really nervous, you know that? But then we got out there, and I felt it—like, this is it. We're actually doing it.\" She turns to you, softer now. \"And I'm so, so glad you were part of it.\"\n\n You blink, caught off guard by how genuine she sounds. \"I mean... I just did my part.\"\n\n Jessica shakes her head. \"You did a lot more than that.\" She nudges your arm playfully. \"I knew you'd be good, but I didn't think you'd be that good.\"\n\n \n Jessica suddenly pauses, the smile fading from her face as she eyes you carefully.\n\n \"Tell me why you're not wearing pajamas again?\"\n\n As you scramble for an excuse, you can't help but laugh. The morning feels just a little lighter with Jessica by your side.\n \n \n You roll your eyes, but you can't help the small smile forming on your face. The morning feels just a little lighter.\n \n\n \n When you walk into homeroom, the usual morning chatter surrounds you—soft murmurs, the occasional yawn, and the tapping of fingers against phone screens. Pajama Day makes the whole room feel sluggish, like everyone is still halfway between sleep and reality.\n\n Jessica is already in her seat next to you, staring at her phone. But unlike usual, she's not furiously typing out messages or scrolling with purpose. Her thumb just hovers, absently swiping up and down, her expression neutral.\n\n You slide into your seat, watching her for a second before speaking. \"You alright?\"\n\n Jessica stops fidgeting and locks her phone, placing it face-down on the desk. She tilts her head toward you, offering a tired smile. \"Yeah. Just thinking.\"\n\n You know what about.\n\n The game. The routine. The squad.\n\n \"You guys did alright,\" you say. The routine wasn't flawless, but it was held together. No major disasters, no outright failures. Just a few stumbles and a few moments where the energy didn't quite hit the way it was supposed to.\n \n Jessica exhales, nodding. \"Yeah. We did alright.\" She taps her nails lightly against the desk. \"I just—I wanted us to be better than that.\"\n\n She doesn't sound frustrated. She doesn't even sound mad at herself. Just... disappointed.\n\n You hesitate, unsure what to say. \"You worked hard for it.\"\n\n Jessica lets out a small, breathy laugh, like she's acknowledging the truth in that. \"I did. We all did. And I know I should be proud of that. I am proud of that. But I also just—\" She exhales, shaking her head. \"I wanted to prove to everyone that we could be great.\"\n\n You don't say anything right away. The way she's speaking, the way she's looking down at her hands, it's clear she's not fishing for reassurance. She's just being honest.\n\n She shifts slightly, offering another small smile—this one a little more real. \"I'm still glad we had the extra help, though.\"\n\n It takes you a second to realize she's talking about you.\n\n You didn't do much—you just helped run formations and offered a few suggestions on the sidelines. But she says it like it mattered. Like you mattered.\n\n Before you can find a response, Jessica straightens up and stretches her arms with a quiet sigh.\n\n \"Anyway,\" she says, picking up her phone again, \"next game, we'll do better.\" She says it not with frustration, but with certainty. Not a demand—just a promise to herself.\n\n And somehow, you believe her.\n\n \n You step into homeroom, the usual morning hum of conversation filling the air. Everyone is draped in pajamas and slouched over their desks, half awake and waiting for the day to begin. It almost feels like a normal Monday—almost. But then you see Jessica.\n\n Jessica is in her usual seat near you, but something's wrong. Normally, she sits like she owns the room—back straight, shoulders squared, effortlessly commanding attention without even trying. Today, though, she looks small. She's hunched over her desk, one elbow propped up as she lazily scrolls through her phone, her expression neutral. Her usual high ponytail is looser than normal, and she barely reacts as people shuffle past her. She's even wearing a hoodie, which is a rare sight, considering Jessica never wears hoodies to school.\n\n You sit down, but she doesn't acknowledge you. Not with a glance, not with a friendly remark, not even with her signature smile. You hesitate before finally speaking. \"Rough weekend?\"\n\n Jessica stops scrolling and turns off her phone, setting it on her desk with an almost hollow motion. When she finally turns to you, her eyes look tired—not the I didn't sleep enough kind of tired, but the kind that sits deeper.\n\n \"We were a disaster,\" she says, voice quiet. \"Like, actually pathetic.\"\n\n You don't answer right away, but you don't really need to—she's not looking for a response. She stares at her desk, fingers still idly twisting the hoodie string.\n\n \"I really thought we'd pull it together,\" she murmurs. \"I kept telling myself that. We've got this. We just need to pull through.\" She shakes her head slightly, almost like she's disgusted with herself. \"But we didn't. We fell apart. And I couldn't do anything.\"\n\n You remember the game—the uneven formations, the mistimed stunts, the way Riverview's cheer squad outshined them without even trying. Even in the stands, you could see the frustration on Jessica's face that night, the way she kept calling out corrections that no one could follow.\n\n She exhales through her nose. \"I should've drilled the routines harder. I should've changed the setlist. I should've—\" She stops, pressing her lips together. \"I don't know. I should've done something.\"\n\n You look at her, at the way she's curling in on herself, her usual bravado completely gone. You realize she's not mad. She's not annoyed. She's genuinely doubting herself.\n\n The worst part of it all? She's not blaming anyone else. Not even you for not helping when you had the chance.\n\n She can only blame herself.\n\n \"Whatever,\" she mutters. \"Doesn't matter now.\"\n\n But the way her voice wavers slightly at the end makes you think it still does.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "The door swings open, and just like that, the quiet morning chatter in the classroom dims. Ms. Carter steps inside, a travel mug of coffee in one hand and a stack of notebooks in the other. She sets her things down at the desk, then scans the room, her gaze landing on a few students still half-asleep in their seats.\n\n\"Good morning,\" she says, her voice even. \"I hope you all had a good weekend.\"\n\nThere's a scatter of lazy responses—half-hearted murmurs, a few nods. The class is still sluggish, heads resting on desks and movements slow.\n\nMs. Carter exhales, not frustrated, but definitely not amused either. \"I know it's Monday, and I know wearing pajamas makes it feel like you're still at home, but I expect you to be awake and paying attention. Please sit up if you're slouching.\"\n\nThere's some reluctant shuffling as a few people adjust their posture.\n\nSatisfied, she continues. \"Now, before we get into anything else, we're going to revisit something from the first week of school.\" She picks up the stack of notebooks, holding them up for emphasis. \"On Thursday that week, I gave each of you a personal reflection journal.\"\n\nA few people shift in their seats, probably just now remembering that existed. Your stomach tightens slightly.\n\n\"I told you when we started that this wasn't just busywork,\" Ms. Carter continues. \"Self-reflection is important, whether you realize it yet or not. So today, you're going to look back at what you wrote and write some more.\"\n\nShe begins walking through the rows, placing the notebooks on desks. \"For now, I just want you to read your responses. Not adjust it, not edit it—just read it.\"\n\nShe sets yours in front of you. Your name is written on the cover, the edges of the notebook slightly bent from being shuffled around over the past week and a half. You stare at it, fingers resting against the cover.\n\n\"You have a few minutes to check it out,\" Ms. Carter says, returning to the front of the room. \"Make good use of them.\"\n\nYou hesitate. You remember that first question.\n\nWho are you right now?\n\nIt felt simple at the time. But now, with everything that's happened since...\n\nYou take a breath and flip the cover open.\n\n[Choice: Who are you now?]",

      "text": "Your eyes scan the words you wrote eleven days ago, your own handwriting staring back at you.\n\n Right now, I'm honestly not sure who I am. I feel like I'm in between something. Everyone probably sees me as the same old guy they've always seen, but I don't feel the same inside. Something weird is happening to me, physically and emotionally, and I'm losing control of who I used to be. I'm trying to act like nothing's wrong, but every day, I feel like I'm changing.\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n \n Your chest tightens.\n\n You remember writing this. You remember how lost you felt, how desperate you were to hold onto something solid, something familiar. You were trying so hard to convince yourself that this was just something happening to you—not something that meant anything.\n\n But now, looking at it again, you realize something.\n\n You don't feel lost anymore.\n\n Your hands loosen their grip on the pages as you sit back slightly. It's strange, because back then, you thought you were falling apart. That every change was pulling you further and further from who you were supposed to be. But now... you're not sure that's true.\n\n <<if [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n You have changed. A lot.\n\n Your face is softer and when you catch your reflection, you don't always recognize yourself at first.\n\n And yet, somehow, that doesn't scare you the way it used to.\n\n You run a hand over your sleeve absentmindedly, thinking back to the last few days—how your reflection has started feeling... comfortable. How being seen differently doesn't make you feel like you're losing something, but like you're finding something.\n \n \n You have changed. Maybe not in the ways that are obvious to everyone else, but in ways that feel impossible to ignore.\n\n The way you think about yourself, the way you react to things—it's different. A few weeks ago, the idea of changing terrified you. You clung to the version of yourself you'd always known, convinced that if you just held on tight enough, this [referto] wouldn't get to you.\n\n But now?\n\n Now, when you stop forcing yourself to push those thoughts away, there's a quiet kind of relief in just... letting them exist. When you stop trying so hard to be what you think you should be, you don't feel like you're losing anything at all. You almost feel like you're finding something.\n \n \n You don't feel like you're in between anymore.\n\n You swallow, staring at the journal.\n\n You know who you are. Or maybe you always knew, and it just took this [referto] to make you stop ignoring it.\n\n And that's terrifying. But it also makes you feel like, for the first time in your life—\n\n You might actually be real.\n <<elseif [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n \n Your grip tightens slightly on the edges of the journal.\n\n You remember writing this—sitting at this very desk, staring at the blank page, feeling like if you didn't get something down, you'd drown in all of it. Back then, everything was still new, still unsettling. The first changes had barely set in, and you'd felt like a stranger in your own body.\n\n Now, eleven days later, you have changed. A lot, actually.\n\n Your hands hover over the pages before curling into loose fists. You don't need a mirror to know what you look like. You've felt it in every passing glance, in the way people's eyes linger on you just a second too long, trying to figure out what's different.\n\n And you hate that you understand why.\n\n You still feel like yourself, but every time you catch your reflection, you're reminded that you don't quite look it anymore.\n\n You press your fingers against your temple and let out a slow breath.\n\n But you are still you. That hasn't changed.\n\n Yeah, your face is different. Yeah, people look at you weird sometimes, and yeah, maybe it messes with your head more than you want to admit. But that doesn't mean you're not still the same person you were before the curse.\n\n You're still a guy. That was never the problem. The problem is the [referto]. The way it's twisting things, making you feel like you're slipping out of your own skin.\n\n You stare down at the page, at the words \"I'm losing control of who I used to be.\"\n\n Maybe you weren't wrong when you wrote that. Maybe you have lost control of some things. But you haven't lost yourself.\n\n As soon as you fix this—get back to the way you're supposed to be—this confusion, this disconnect, this wrongness will finally be gone.\n\n It has to be.\n \n \n \n You let out a slow breath, leaning back in your chair.\n\n You remember writing this. You remember how it felt—like the ground was shifting beneath you, like you were trapped in something you didn't understand. The changes, the uncertainty, the way everything felt wrong and out of control. At the time, it was overwhelming.\n\n But now?\n\n Now, it just feels like something you wrote in the middle of panicking.\n\n Because you do know who you are. You're still you. You're still a guy. Nothing about that has changed. The [referto] may have messed with you for a bit, made you second-guess things, but that doesn't mean you were actually confused about yourself. It just means you were dealing with something impossible, something unnatural, and it got to you for a while.\n\n Your fingers tighten slightly on the journal's edges.\n\n You're not in between anything. You never were. You were just freaking out. You're still a guy. You're still you.\n\n And once this [referto] is gone, everything will go back to normal.\n\n You exhale and shake off whatever weird tension has started creeping in.\n\n That was then. This is now. You know exactly who you are.\n \n\n \n You stare at the words on the page, your own handwriting frozen in time from eleven days ago.\n\n \"I'm still the same person I've always been. Just [name]. I like hanging out with Luke and Samantha, not taking things too seriously, and just being an average guy. Nothing's changed at all except this problem I've been having. I hope I can resolve this stupid problem, move on from it, and not have to deal with it anymore.\"\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n \n You read it again. Then a third time.\n\n The words sit heavy in your chest, like a weight pressing down, but you don't know why.\n\n Nothing's changed. That's what you wrote. That's what you believed. And yet...\n\n Your thumb rubs over the corner of the page, the edges slightly bent from where Ms. Carter must've flipped through it. The handwriting is yours. The thoughts were yours. But looking at it now, something about them feels... off. Like an old shirt that doesn't quite fit anymore.\n\n You wanted that to be true. You wanted this to just be a temporary problem. Something to fix. Something to get rid of.\n\n But over the past eleven days, things have shifted—small, subtle things that you didn't want to think too hard about.\n\n Like how, at first, the changes to your face made you panic—but now, when you catch your reflection, there's this strange, quiet moment where you just look.\n\n Or how you used to brace yourself every time someone used \"he\" for you—because it reminded you that no matter how much your body was changing, the world still saw you the same way.\n\n And you don't know why that feeling hasn't faded by now.\n\n You press your palm against your forehead, breathing out slowly.\n\n This wasn't supposed to happen.\n\n If nothing's changed—if you're really still the same person you've always been—\n\n ...Then why doesn't it feel that way?\n <<elseif [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n \n Your fingers tightens lightly slightly around the edges of your notebook.\n\n It should still feel true. It is still true. You're still you. You still joke around with Luke, roll your eyes at Samantha, and waste time playing games or scrolling on your phone like none of this is happening. You still just want things to go back to normal.\n\n But as you sit there, reading the words over again, you can't ignore the way your stomach twists.\n\n Because things have changed.\n\n Your hands reflexively tighten into fists before you force them to relax. You don't need to look at yourself to feel the subtle differences. Your face especially isn't something you can ignore. You see it every time you pass a mirror, every time you open your camera by accident, and every time someone looks at you for a second too long.\n\n Sometimes you catch your reflection in a window and don't recognize yourself for a split second. And that moment—that moment—where your brain hesitates to remember it's you—it's the worst feeling in the world.\n\n You glance back down at the words again.\n\n \"I'm still the same person I've always been.\"\n\n Your grip on the journal tightens.\n\n You are still the same person. Once the [referto] is fixed, everything will go back to normal.\n\n But you don't feel the same. \n \n \n \n You lean back in your seat, exhaling slowly.\n\n Yeah. That still feels right.\n\n You don't know why you expected to feel any different reading it back. Maybe because so much has happened since then, with the [referto], with magic, with everything. But at the core of it, nothing about you has really changed. You're still just... you. A normal guy dealing with something really abnormal.\n\n The past week and a half have been frustrating, sure. Worrying. Annoying. But none of it has actually changed you much. You still hang out with Luke, still roll your eyes at Samantha's sarcasm, still waste time on your phone when you should be doing something productive. You still think about college, the future, and where you'll be after all of this.\n\n The [referto] has been a constant weight in the back of your mind, but that's all it is—a problem. A very weird, very real problem. One you need to fix.\n\n You drum your fingers idly against the desk, staring at your journal.\n\n It is weird looking back, now that you think about it. Eleven days ago, you thought you'd have this solved by now. That you'd find a way to break the [referto], move on, and put all of this behind you. But you're still here, still stuck in the middle of it. And the worst part is, you're no closer to an answer than when you started.\n\n But that doesn't change anything.\n\n You're still you. This is something you have to deal with. And when it's over, you'll move on, just like you said you would.\n \n\n \n Your eyes move over the words carefully.\n\n \"Right now, I'm...evolving, to say the least. It's weird, but I feel I'm not exactly the same person I was even a few days ago. There's this strange pull as if I'm growing into something different. I don't know what that is yet, but part of me is curious and eager to find out. Maybe people still see me as [name], but I'm not sure that's the full picture anymore.\"\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n \n You exhale, staring down at the page.\n\n You were right. Even back then, when everything felt uncertain, when you didn't have the words for what you were feeling—you knew.\n\n You didn't know how things would change, or what it would feel like, or how much of yourself you'd have to break down and rebuild, but the feeling you wrote about—the pull, the curiosity, the sense that something was shifting inside you—that was real. And now, eleven days later, you're finally starting to understand it.\n\n You have changed.\n\n And it's not just because of the [referto]. It's something deeper than that. It's the way you've stopped forcing yourself to fight every shift, the way you've started listening to that part of you that maybe wanted to change all along.\n\n You used to be afraid of that feeling. But now?\n\n Now, it feels like you're learning something important. Something you perhaps should've known all along.\n\n You run a hand over the page, tracing your own handwriting.\n\n You don't know who you were when you wrote this.\n\n But maybe, just maybe, you're starting to figure it out.\n <<elseif [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n \n Your fingers tighten slightly on the edges of the journal.\n\n You remember writing this, but reading it now makes your stomach twist. Eager to find out? What the hell were you thinking?\n\n Back then, the changes had barely started. You had no idea how far this would go, how much of yourself you'd end up losing. Now, you don't need to wonder what you were \"growing into.\" You're living it. Every time you catch your reflection, every time you feel someone's lingering stare, every time your own body moves in a way that feels just a little too different, you're reminded of what exactly the [referto] has done to you.\n\n You don't look the same anymore. That's just a fact.\n\n You can feel the hesitation when people talk to you, the way their eyes flicker over your face before they act like nothing's different. You know they notice. And even if they don't say it, you can feel it in the air around you.\n\n You inhale slowly, forcing yourself to breathe.\n\n You were wrong when you wrote this. The \"pull\" you felt wasn't something natural. It wasn't something you were supposed to lean into. It was just the [referto] sinking its damn claws into you, trying to twist you into something you weren't. And you let yourself entertain the idea—like there was something worth finding at the other end of it.\n\n You grip the journal a little harder.\n\n You are still [name]. You're still a guy. That hasn't changed, no matter what this [referto] has done to you. No matter how people look at you now.\n\n Once you fix this—once you undo all of it—everything will go back to the way it's supposed to be.\n\n It has to.\n \n \n \n You frown slightly. Eager to find out? What were you even talking about?\n\n You remember writing this. You remember feeling... unsettled, like something was shifting inside you, like you were standing on unstable ground. But looking at it now, it just seems dramatic. Overblown.\n\n You're still [name]. You're still the same guy you've always been. Yeah, the past couple of weeks have been weird—stressful, annoying, a constant headache—but that doesn't mean you've become someone else.\n\n The \"pull\" you wrote about? That was just fear. Fear of the changes, fear of losing control, fear of things getting worse. But you've dealt with it. You've adjusted. You know who you are, and you don't feel confused anymore.\n\n You let out a quiet breath, drumming your fingers against the desk.\n\n Maybe you were just in a weird headspace that day. Letting the [referto] mess with your head. It's not like you actually believed you were turning into someone else.\n\n You shake your head.\n\n Whatever you were feeling back then, it doesn't matter now. You know where you stand. You're fine.\n\n And once this [referto] is gone, everything will be normal again.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Move on]",

      "text": "You shut your journal softly, fingers lingering on the cover. The words you wrote eleven days ago still sit heavy in your mind, but there's no more time to dwell on them. The past is written, but the present keeps moving.\n\nMs. Carter claps her hands together lightly, drawing the room's attention. \"Alright,\" she says, leaning against her desk. \"Now that you've had a moment to look at your first entry, we're going to move forward.\"\n\nShe picks up a piece of chalk and writes something on the board. When she steps aside, you see the next reflection prompt, written in neat letters:\n\n\"Who in your life do you feel most comfortable around, and why?\"\n\nYou shift slightly in your seat.\n\nMs. Carter continues, \"This doesn't have to be your best friend, or even someone you talk to on a daily basis. Just think about who makes you feel like you can be yourself. Who you don't have to pretend around. And most importantly, why that is.\" She pauses, scanning the room. \"Take your timem and be honest with yourself.\"\n\nYou glance back down at your journal, turning to a fresh page.\n\nThe question shouldn't be that hard to answer, but as you tap the end of your pen against the page, you realize there's more than one way to approach it.\n\nYour thoughts drift to the people in your life, the ones who make things easier. The ones who mean something to you.\n\nLuke\n\nYour first thought is Luke. He's been there forever, since childhood, since before any of this was complicated. With Luke, things are easy. He doesn't make you think too hard, doesn't expect you to be anything other than who you are. There's never any pressure—just dumb jokes, bad ideas, and a kind of friendship that feels like it could last forever.\n\nAnd yet, sometimes, there's this moment—this flicker of something different, something just beneath the surface. A warmth that lingers when he slings an arm around your shoulder, a look that lasts a second too long before he laughs it off. Maybe it's nothing. Maybe it's everything.\n\nSamantha\n\nThen there's Samantha. She's the one who calls you out on your nonsense, who refuses to let you get away with half-baked excuses. But she's also the one who stays. Who listens when it matters, even when she pretends she's not. She's sharp, sarcastic, a little bit reckless—but there's this honesty to her that makes you feel safe.\n\nWith Samantha, you never have to worry about saying the right thing, because she's not afraid to say the wrong thing first.\n\nJessica\n\nYour pen hovers over the page as Jessica crosses your mind.\n\nShe's not someone you ever expected to get to know. She's Jessica Sanders—the queen bee, the girl who owns every room she walks into. But under all that polish and confidence, there's a realness to her you've only started to see. A vulnerability she doesn't show to just anyone.\n\nAnd somehow, against all odds, she's let you into her world.\n\nWith Jessica, being yourself doesn't mean staying the same. It means pushing forward, striving for something more. She expects a lot, but maybe that's because she believes in you. And maybe... that feels kind of good.\n\nVincent\n\nThen there's Vincent.\n\nHe's different from the others—not loud, not overbearing, not dramatic, not someone who forces himself into your life. He's quiet but present. The kind of person who sees things others miss.\n\nWith Vincent, there's no pressure to perform. You can just sit beside him, flipping through books or getting lost in some random discussion about history or philosophy, and it's enough. You don't need to fill the silence, because he doesn't expect you to.\n\nAnd that? That's rare.\n\nAurora\n\nYou hesitate before thinking of Aurora.\n\nShe's still a mystery, still someone you don't quite understand. But that's part of what draws you in—the way she moves through the world like she knows something you don't. Like she sees you in a way no one else does.\n\nShe doesn't ask you to explain yourself. She doesn't need to. \n\nWith Aurora, there's this sense that she already knows who you are—even if you don't.\n\nJordan\n\nAnd then there's Jordan.\n\nYou never thought you'd even talk to him. He's cold, distant, always keeping people at arm's length. But when you see past that—when you catch the small moments where he lets his guard slip—it's something else entirely.\n\nHe's not someone who hands over his trust easily. But if he starts to trust someone, it means something.\n\nBecause Jordan doesn't waste time on things he doesn't care about.\n\nYour pen hovers over the page.\n\nWho in your life do you feel most comfortable around, and why?\n\n[Choice: Luke — Because he makes things feel easy]\n[Choice: Samantha — Because she keeps you grounded]\n[Choice: Jessica — Because she pushes you to be more]\n[Choice: Vincent — Because he lets you be you]\n[Choice: Aurora — Because she sees you in ways others don't]\n[Choice: Jordan — Because there's more to him than what people see]\n[Choice: I'm not really interested in anyone]",

      "text": "Your pen hovers over the page for a moment before you press it down, the answer coming more easily than you expected.\n\n Luke.\n\n It's almost obvious when you think about it. Luke has been there since the beginning—before the curse, before things got weird, before you ever had to start questioning anything. With him, things don't feel complicated. There's no pressure or expectations.\n\n Luke just makes everything easy.\n\n You think about all the times he's been at your side, always effortlessly slipping into your space like he belongs there. The way he laughs like the world isn't so serious, like things will always work out. The way he just accepts you—without hesitation, without overthinking, without making anything weird.\n\n Even when he does notice something's off, he doesn't push. He just sticks around, acting like nothing's changed unless you want it to.\n\n Maybe that's why you feel so comfortable with him. Because with Luke, you don't have to explain yourself. You don't have to worry about how you look, or what you say, or whether you're changing in ways you don't understand yet. You don't have to question whether he'll be there tomorrow, or next week, or next year—because of course he will.\n\n That's just how Luke is.\n\n A constant friendship.\n\n You take a breath, finishing the sentence.\n\n Luke, because he makes everything feel easy.\n\n \n \n \n Your pen taps against the page as you think, but deep down, the answer is already there.\n\n Samantha.\n\n It's funny—she'd probably roll her eyes if she knew you were writing this. Make some sarcastic remark about how she's obviously the best person in your life and how it took you way too long to admit it. But underneath all that sharp humor, that constant teasing, there's something real.\n\n Samantha has always been there—not in an obvious way, but in a way that matters. She doesn't sugarcoat things, doesn't tell you what you want to hear just to make you feel better. She calls you out when she you're being stupid, challenges you when you need it, and pushes you to actually think instead of drifting aimlessly through life.\n\n And yet, for all her sarcasm and blunt honesty, she's never turned her back on you. Not. Even. Once.\n\n You think about all the late-night talks, the times she's sat next to you in comfortable silence, the way she notices when something's wrong. How she lets you sit with your thoughts for as long as you need before finally cutting through them with a dry, \"Are you done brooding yet, or do I have to stage an intervention?\"\n\n She makes you feel real, and that's why you feel so comfortable with her. Because no matter how much things change, no matter how different you start to feel, she won't look at you any differently. She'll still be Samantha. And she'll still see you.\n\n You take a breath and write the words down.\n\n Samantha, because she keeps me grounded.\n\n \n \n \n Your pen hovers over the page, hesitating for only a moment before you press it down.\n\n Jessica.\n\n If someone had told you two weeks ago that she'd be the person you felt most comfortable with, you would've laughed. Jessica Sanders—queen bee, head cheerleader, the kind of person who seems untouchable, who always has her life together. The girl who expects excellence in everything she does. The girl who never settles for just okay.\n\n And yet, here you are.\n\n Because there's a lot more to Jessica than the perfect image she shows the world.\n\n She's confident, but not invincible. Strong, but not unshakable. Beneath all the polish and effortless control, there's a realness to her—a pressure she carries that most people never bother to notice. She's always leading, always holding things together, always making sure everything runs smoothly, because if she doesn't, who else will?\n\n Jessica doesn't just make you feel comfortable. She makes you feel capable. Like you can be more than what you are, like you're meant to be more. She expects a lot, sure but that's because she believes in you—because she won't let you settle for anything less than your very best.\n\n Maybe that's why you feel so drawn to her.\n\n Because when she looks at you, she doesn't see who you are. She sees who you could be.\n\n And that makes you want to see it too.\n\n You take a breath and write it down.\n\n Jessica, because she pushes me to be more.\n\n \n \n \n Your pen moves before you can second-guess yourself.\n\n Vincent.\n\n There's something about him that makes things feel easier—not in the way Luke does, where everything is light and effortless, but in a way that feels... quiet. Safe. Like you don't have to try so hard.\n\n Vincent isn't the kind of person who demands attention. He doesn't take up space the way others do. If anything, he seems almost afraid to, always second-guessing himself, always shrinking back just enough that you can tell he's worried about saying the wrong thing, about being too much.\n\n And yet, when you're around him, none of that feels like a burden.\n\n Because Vincent just listens. Not to fill the silence, not just to be polite—but because he genuinely cares. When he talks, it's never just small talk—it's something deeper, something thoughtful, something that reminds you that the world is bigger than this moment. His mind is full of history, of old stories, of people long gone but still remembered—and somehow, he makes you feel like you belong among all of it.\n\n With Vincent, there's no pressure to say the right thing or any expectation to be more than what you already are. He doesn't make you feel like you have to prove yourself, like you have to be interesting or impressive just to be worth talking to.\n\n You just exist. You're you. And that's enough.\n\n And maybe that's why he feels so different from everyone else—because even though he's afraid of being seen, of being judged, he never makes you feel that way.\n\n You take a deep breath and write it down.\n\n Vincent, because he lets me be me.\n\n \n \n \n Your pen hovers over the page for a moment before pressing down.\n\n Aurora.\n\n It's strange, because even now, you don't feel like you even know her. Not really. Aurora is just different. She never asks for explanations. Never demands answers. She simply looks at you, and somehow, that's enough. Like she already knows—as if she sees something you haven't even figured out for yourself yet.\n\n And that should be unsettling. Hell, at first, it was. But over time, you realized something: with Aurora, you don't have to pretend. You don't have to explain why things feel off, or why certain thoughts linger longer than they should. You don't have to justify the questions you don't even have the words for yet.\n\n Because she already understands.\n\n She carries her own mysteries, her own secrets, and yet she never seems lost. She moves through the world with a sense of certainty, like she's always known exactly who she is. And somehow, when you're around her, you feel like she's offering you that same kind of certainty—like maybe, if you listen closely enough, if you let yourself see what she does, you might understand yourself too.\n\n Aurora makes you feel seen and right now, that's what you need the most.\n\n ''Aurora, because she sees what others don't.\n\n \n \n \n Your pen hesitates for a moment before pressing to the page.\n\n Jordan.''\n\n It's almost strange, picking him. He's not someone you ever expected to be comfortable around. At first glance, Jordan is cold, distant—the kind of person who keeps his walls up so high that most people don't even bother trying to get past them. And if you hadn't spent time around him, you might have thought there was nothing beyond that sharp exterior.\n\n But that's not true.\n\n Jordan isn't distant because he doesn't care. He's distant because he does. Because caring means opening up, and opening up means getting hurt. So instead, he acts like nothing matters. Like nothing touches him. Like he doesn't need anyone.\n \n But you've seen moments where the cracks show.\n\n The way his eyes linger on things he pretends not to care about. The way he gets quiet when he thinks no one's paying attention. The way he fights so hard to keep himself together, as if the second he lets go, he'll fall apart.\n\n Jordan doesn't make things easy. He doesn't fill silence just to make it less awkward. But in a weird way, that's why it works. You don't have to force anything around him. You don't have to say the right things or pretend to be something you're not.\n\n Because Jordan doesn't waste time on people he doesn't care about. And the fact that he even lets you in, even a little, means more than words ever could.\n\n You take a breath, then write it down.\n\n ''Jordan, because there's more to him than what people see.\n\n \n Your pen hovers over the page for a long moment before you finally start writing.\n\n I'm not really interested in anyone.''\n\n And that's the truth. It's not that you don't care about the people around you—you most certainly do. Some of them have been in your life for years, some of them are new but have started to matter in unexpected ways nonetheless. But when it comes to that kind of feeling, the kind that turns a friendship into something more... it just isn't there.\n\n Maybe you've been too distracted to think about it. Between school, the [referto], and the way everything keeps shifting around you, there hasn't been much time to consider what you want from other people. Or maybe you just don't feel that way about anyone right now. And that's fine.\n\n You exhale, tapping your pen against the paper.\n\n There's no rule saying you have to figure all of this out now. No deadline or expectation.\n\n You're still sorting through who you are, what this [referto] means, what any of this means. And maybe, for now, that's enough.\n\n You glance down at the page and finish the thought.\n \n ''I'm not really interested in anyone, and I think I'm okay with that.''\n \n\n \n [Choice: No love today]\n\n \n [Choice: Love blooms?]",

But there's no tension in his shoulders, not like usual.\n\n You hesitate for half a second, then start walking toward him.\n\n He hears your footsteps and glances over. His expression softens the moment he sees it's you.\n\n \"Hey,\" he says, voice low but not cold. \"Looking for a partner?\"\n\n You smirk. \"Is it that obvious?\"\n\n Jordan shrugs, but there's a trace of a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. \"You just looked like you didn't want to end up with someone who reads everything like it's a book report.\"\n\n \"Guilty as charged,\" you say, chuckling.\n\n Jordan lifts his script and says, \"You know, I was hoping you'd come over.\"\n\n \"Yeah?\"\n\n He nods, glancing toward the open space near the stage. \"We work well together. And I've kinda been looking forward to this scene.\"\n\n The last part is quiet, almost like he's admitting something secret.\n\n \"I'm assuming you're going to take Romeo?\" you ask, raising your brows playfully.\n\n He huffs a soft laugh and gives you a sideways glance. \"Only if you don't mind being Juliet.\"\n\n There's no pushiness in his tone—just a mutual trust. You know that he knows that you'll take this seriously.\n\n \"I don't mind,\" you affirm, nodding.\n\n \"Cool.\" He gestures with his head, motioning toward a clear spot in the auditorium. \"Let's run it there. Less people breathing down our necks.\"\n\n You follow him, flipping open your script as you walk. There are no desks here, just a sea of chairs, an open floor, and the stage above. It almost feels like something bigger than a classroom.\n\n Jordan steps into the space with a kind of quiet confidence. He knows where to stand. How to carry himself. The script in his hand might as well be a sword.\n\n He looks back at you and gives a small nod. \"Ready?\"\n\n \"Are you?\" you ask, smirking.\n\n For the first time all class, he smiles—real, just a little crooked.\n\n <<if [jordanRelo] > 49>> \n \"With you? Yeah.\"\n \n \n \"Yeah.\"\n \n\n Whatever's about to happen, you're not doing it alone. Jordan's walls are lower here, you can feel it. He might not say everything out loud, but the trust is there.\n\n Now it's just a matter of choosing how you bring Juliet to life.\n<<elseif [jordanRelo] > 14>> \n As the noise of the class swells with students pairing off, you spot Jordan leaning against the side of the stage. His script is already open, but he's not reading it. He's just.. waiting. Watching. His posture is casual, but his eyes are sharp—like he's measuring how seriously everyone's taking this.\n\n You hesitate. You and Jordan aren't exactly friends, but you've had a few good moments—he's opened up a little, here and there. Enough that the idea of partnering with him doesn't feel risky, just... uncertain.\n\n Still, you find yourself heading his way.\n\n He looks up when you approach, eyebrow raised.\n\n \"You good with me as a scene partner?\" you ask, trying to keep it casual.\n\n Jordan tilts his head, considering. Then, he gives a small shrug. \"Sure. Beats getting stuck with someone who doesn't know how to act.\" He nods toward the open space near the front of the auditorium. \"Let's run it there.\"\n\n You follow, flipping open your script. As you walk, he glances sideways at you.\n\n \"You're gonna be Juliet,\" he declares, voice low but steady—like he's already decided and doesn't expect a fight about it.\n\n \"Not even gonna ask?\" you reply, blinking.\n\n Jordan stops just short of the edge of the open floor, turning enough to look at you properly. \"No offense, but you'd kill it more than I would. I've got Romeo locked down. Trust me.\"\n\n There's no bite in his tone though—only confidence. Maybe a little challenge too, like he's waiting to see if you'll push back.\n\n You pause, about to say something, but then you catch the edge of his expression. He's not trying to boss you around. He just... really wants this scene to be good.\n\n You sigh, smirking. \"Alright. Juliet it is.\"\n\n Jordan nods, already stepping into position near the front of the room. He plants his feet like he's walked this scene a hundred times in his head, like he knows exactly where every beat should land.\n\n You find your mark a few feet away, flipping to the balcony scene, the weight of Juliet's lines now sitting heavy in your hands.\n\n Whatever this scene is going to be, he's trusting you to meet him there.\n\n \n You scan the auditorium, eyes trailing across the shifting tide of students pairing up. The sound of flipping scripts, low chatter, and Mr. Bennet's voice ringing with theatrical praise swirls around you like background noise.\n\n And then you spot him—Jordan.\n\n He's off to the back of the room, standing with his back partially turned to the rest of the class. His arms are crossed and his script is tucked under one hand. His posture is classic Jordan: guarded and tense, like he's daring someone to interrupt his space.\n\n You hesitate. Of all the people here, he's the riskiest choice. You haven't exactly... bonded with him, to say the least. A few cold interactions. Some sharp looks. A vague mutual awareness in the halls. It's not a rivalry, but it's definitely not friendship either.\n\n Still, something draws you in.\n\n You walk over slowly, heart thudding a bit, and stop beside him. \"You got a partner?\"\n\n He doesn't look at you at first, just shifting his weight instead of responding. For a moment, you think he's going to ignore you.\n\n \"No,\" he finally mutters. \"But I'll take you.\"\n\n You blink. \"Okay. Cool. Do you wanna—\"\n\n \"I'm playing Romeo.\"\n\n You pause. \"...Right.\"\n\n Jordan finally turns his head just enough to meet your eyes. His voice is low, but sharp enough to slice. \"You're Juliet. Don't argue about it.\"\n\n There's no room for debate in his tone. He doesn't say it with arrogance—it's more like control. Like this is his domain, and he doesn't trust anyone else to mess it up.\n\n You hold his stare for a few beats before nodding. \"Fine. Juliet, it is.\"\n\n He looks away again and steps into open space. You follow him, flipping to the balcony scene in your script. You can feel the wall he's got up between you—thick and concrete—but there's also something underneath it. A kind of weird precision. He's not winging this, you can tell. He's thought about this scene.\n\n Jordan glances over his shoulder. \"Don't half-ass it.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"You think I'm going to?\"\n\n His eyes flicker before he looks back to the page. \"Just don't make me carry the scene.\"\n\n You're not sure if that's a challenge or a warning.\n\n You grip your script a little tighter. You decide that if you're going to do this, you're going to meet him on his level.\n\n Even if he doesn't want to let you in.\n \n\n[Choice: Be calm and steady]\n[Choice: Be witty and playful]\n[Choice: Be wide-eyed and hopeful]\n[Choice: Be restrained but simmering]",

      "text": "Read with Jordan Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n \n \n \n You adjust your grip on the script, already feeling the nervous energy ripple through the auditorium. A few students are being dramatic, over-the-top, throwing themselves into the words like it's a soap opera.\n\n But that's not Juliet.\n\n At least—not how you see her.\n\n She's young, sure. In love, most definitely. But Juliet isn't chaotic—she's sharp, grounded, and smarter than anyone gives her credit for. She understands the danger of this situation. She's not panicking. She's measured.\n\n So that's what you'll bring to the table: stillness. A Juliet who listens before she leaps.\n\n Jordan stands across from you, solid and composed. His eyes flick to the page, then lift just briefly toward you. He's not nervous—not even a little. He's done the work. You can feel it in the way he stands, in the way he breathes.\n\n Then he begins.\n\n \"O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head...\"\n\n He speaks with a quiet intensity—each word deliberate, restrained but charged. He doesn't perform the lines—he inhabits them. It's less like he's reading Shakespeare and more like Romeo just exists inside of him.\n\n And then it's your turn.\n\n You don't move much. Don't raise your voice.\n\n You just... speak.\n\n \"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\"\n\n It's thoughtful, almost curious—like Juliet's been turning the question over in her head for a while before finally giving it a voice.\n\n \"Deny thy father and refuse thy name,\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\n And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\"\n\n You say it plainly, without any embellishment. Not coldly—but with certainty. Juliet isn't pleading. She's deciding.\n\n Jordan glances up at you, not breaking character, but responding. His posture shifts ever so slightly, like even his Romeo knows this Juliet isn't to be underestimated.\n\n \"Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\"\n\n The line is quieter and more vulnerable than before. Like you've unsettled him. Just a little.\n\n You press on.\n\n \"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.\"\n\n Each word is paced and firm, like Juliet is sorting through the logic of the world, turning it over in her mind.\n\n \"What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,\n Nor arm, nor face...\"\n\n You look directly at Jordan now, calm but unshaken, as if Juliet is only laying out the facts.\n\n \"O, be some other name belonging to a man.\n What's in a name? That which we call a rose\n By any other word would smell as sweet.\"\n\n The line isn't flowery—it's clear, clean, a simple truth. You don't press for emotion. You let the meaning speak for itself.\n\n You say it like Juliet's heard it before, like she's quoting something older than herself, but still choosing to believe in it.\n\n \"So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,\n Retain that dear perfection which he owes\n Without that title.\"\n\n You finally glance at Jordan again, eyebrows raised and lips twitching—like Juliet knows exactly how perfect he is and is not afraid to point it out.\n\n Then, almost offhanded—like it's a casual suggestion:\n\n \"Romeo, doff thy name,\n And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,\n Take all myself.\"\n\n You don't rush it. You don't push it.\n\n You just say it.\n\n And it lands.\n\n The silence afterward feels earned.\n\n Jordan's eyes haven't left you. His expression doesn't change much, but there's something there—recognition.\n\n Mr. Bennet breathes in slowly, as if recovering from something. Then he breaks into applause so sudden and loud that half the class flinches.\n\n \"Restraint! Grace! Clarity!\" he bellows, twirling in a full circle before stopping with a hand pressed to his chest. \"Juliet as an anchor—steady amidst the whirlwind of love!\"\n\n He turns to Jordan, beaming. \"And you, Romeo! Powerfully contained! Simmering beneath the surface! Like lightning behind glass!\"\n\n Jordan accepts the praise with a simple nod. Not smug—just composed, like he knew exactly what he brought to the scene and didn't need validation for it.\n\n As the class slowly returns to its scattered energy, Jordan approaches, eyes on you.\n\n \"You held it down,\" he says, voice low.\n\n \"You too,\" you reply, smiling faintly.\n\n He pauses before nodding once. \"That was solid.\"\n\n And for someone like Jordan? That's the equivalent of shouting your praises from the rooftops.\n\n \n \n You flip open your script, scanning the lines again. You've read this scene a dozen times by now, but something clicks today—not with tragedy or longing, but something smarter.\n\n Juliet isn't helpless here. She's not just some naïve girl lamenting the stars. She's clever, sharp-tongued, and aware of how absurd it is to fall for a boy she's only just met. And yeah, sure, she's falling for him anyway—but she's going to have fun with it.\n\n Across from you, Jordan stands like he's carved from confidence, jaw tight, shoulders relaxed, script gripped loosely in one hand. There's no hesitation in his posture whatsoever—he knows exactly what he's doing.\n\n He's ready.\n\n Then he starts.\n\n \"O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head...\"\n\n He doesn't just say the lines—he commands them. His Romeo is intense, full of reverence, his voice ringing with restrained passion. The words hit like a spell—carefully controlled, but brimming with heat.\n\n You raise an eyebrow as he speaks, tilting your head like Juliet's not sure if she should be flattered or rolling her eyes.\n\n Then it's your turn.\n\n \"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\"\n\n You say it like you're poking fun at yourself—mock-dramatic, half-laughing, like Juliet's thinking to herself, Wow, this is so ridiculous, but she's into it anyway.\n\n \"Deny thy father and refuse thy name,\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\n And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\"\n\n You emphasize \"sworn my love\" like it's a dare. Your tone is light, teasing, and almost flirtatious—but beneath it, there's something real. Something curious.\n\n Jordan glances up from his script, just barely. You catch the twitch of a smirk at the edge of his mouth.\n\n \"Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\"\n\n He's quiet and thoughtful, but with a thread of tension, like Romeo's not sure how long he can stay hidden.\n\n You pick up your pace, letting the words dance off your tongue.\n\n \"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.\"\n\n You walk a slow circle, gesturing idly with your script like Juliet's giving a lecture on how names are stupid.\n\n \"What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,\n Nor arm, nor face...\"\n\n You make a show of counting off each body part, playful and exaggerated, drawing a quiet laugh from somewhere in the room.\n\n \"O, be some other name belonging to a man.\"\n\n Your voice dips here, just enough to hint at something underneath all the playfulness—desire, maybe. Wonder.\n\n \"What's in a name? That which we call a rose\n By any other word would smell as sweet.\"\n\n You say it like Juliet's heard it before, like she's quoting something older than herself, but still choosing to believe in it.\n\n \"So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,\n Retain that dear perfection which he owes\n Without that title.\"\n\n You finally glance at Jordan again, eyebrows raised and lips twitching—like Juliet knows exactly how perfect he is and is not afraid to point it out.\n\n Then, almost offhanded—like it's a casual suggestion:\n\n \"Romeo, doff thy name,\n And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,\n Take all myself.\"\n\n You hold the beat there, not with solemnity, but with invitation.\n\n And Jordan—\n\n He doesn't miss a step.\n\n His reaction isn't wide-eyed or flustered. It's focused, taut, like Romeo is trying to stay composed but the air between you has shifted.\n\n You can feel it too. The scene might be playful on your end, but the way he plays it off makes the whole thing crackle.\n\n When you finish, the room is quiet.\n\n Then, Mr. Bennet makes an excited sound you can't describe.\n\n \"Wit! Charm! Subversion!\" he exclaims, spinning dramatically. \"Juliet as a thinker, as a tease, as a girl who dares to enjoy herself! Yes!\"\n\n He points a finger toward Jordan without hesitation. \"And you—focused. Precise. Electric! You gave [name] space and let the tension rise!\"\n\n Jordan doesn't move much. He doesn't need to. He just gives the faintest nod, like of course he nailed it.\n\n Then, as the class starts to shift back into motion, he glances at you.\n\n \"You're dangerous,\" he says simply.\n\n \"Was that Juliet or me?\" you ask.\n\n He shrugs. \"Does it matter?\"\n\n And that? That might be the most flattering thing Jordan's ever said.\n\n \n \n You turn the script over in your hands as you think. You could be intense, but something holds you back. Something about this scene, this moment, feels like it deserves a softer touch.\n\n Because Juliet isn't jaded. She hadn't learned to protect herself yet. She's standing on the edge of something brand new, dangerous, and dazzling all at once, and for a moment—just the tiniest speck of time—she lets herself believe that love might be enough to defy all odds.\n\n You exhale quietly.\n\n That's the Juliet you're going to play.\n\n Jordan shifts into place across from you. There's a quiet stillness in him—but not the guarded kind. He's focused. He's grounded.\n\n And then, he begins.\n\n \"O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\n As is a wingèd messenger of heaven...\"\n\n His voice is completely different from what you saw last week. Stronger and more poised, every word lands with practiced clarity, emotion tucked just beneath the surface—but you can feel it in his every pause and look.\n\n Jordan doesn't stumble or hesitate.\n\n He's in it.\n\n And somehow, that makes it easier for you to follow.\n\n You take a step forward and lift your chin, your voice soft but unwavering.\n\n \"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\"\n\n It's not a complaint. Not at all. It's a question from someone who believes in love enough to ask for the impossible. You keep your tone warm, a little breathless, like Juliet herself can barely believe she's speaking these words aloud.\n\n \"Deny thy father and refuse thy name,\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\n And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\"\n\n You don't look at Jordan directly—you stare off into some imagined night sky, like Juliet has no idea she's being overheard. Your voice carries a quiet longing, a kind of hopeful ache. Juliet, to you, is trying to wish this situation into something simpler.\n\n \"Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\"\n\n His tone is lower now, like he's caught off guard by what he's hearing.\n\n You keep going, letting the hope bloom in your chest with each line.\n\n \"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.\"\n\n There's a wonder in your tone as you move slowly, as if afraid to scare the moment away, and every word feels like you're daring to dream.\n\n \"What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,\n Nor arm, nor face...\"\n\n Your voice softens more with each line, hands gently gesturing like you're brushing aside the world's rules.\n\n \"O, be some other name belonging to a man.\n What's in a name? That which we call a rose\n By any other word would smell as sweet.\"\n\n You let the line linger. it feels true, even if Juliet's only just beginning to understand it.\n\n \"So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,\n Retain that dear perfection which he owes\n Without that title.\"\n\n You steal a glance at Jordan—he's fully focused, watching you as if seeing Juliet for the first time.\n\n And when you speak the last few lines, your voice drops to barely more than a whisper.\n\n \"Romeo, doff thy name,\n And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,\n Take all myself.\"\n\n You don't move, don't gesture, don't blink. You just offer it—like Juliet truly believes he might say yes.\n\n The moment hangs in the air.\n\n Mr. Bennet doesn't interrupt. The class doesn't whisper. Even the lights overhead seem to hum a little softer.\n\n Jordan slowly lowers his script, still watching you.\n\n Then Mr. Bennet finally claps—once, loud and sharp, and then again, more theatrical.\n\n \"YES!\" he exclaims, gesturing dramatically. \"That is the magic I've been waiting for.\"\n\n He spins toward Jordan. \"And you, my dear Romeo, are no longer holding back. You stepped into the role with conviction! With focus!\"\n\n Jordan doesn't flinch or react. He just gives a short nod, like he already knew that. Like anything less wouldn't have been acceptable.\n\n Mr. Bennet turns to you. \"And you, Juliet.. Hopeful. Honest. Real. You gave the scene its heart.\"\n\n A few students around the room murmur in surprise—you weren't the loudest or the flashiest, but something about it landed.\n\n Jordan shifts slightly as the class begins to move again. \"Solid read,\" he admits, low and even, eyes on his script.\n\n You raise an eyebrow, grinning. \"You know, you weren't half bad either.\"\n\n He finally looks at you. \"I practiced.\" It's not an admission—it's a statement of fact. Then, after a pause, he adds, \"Didn't expect that from you.\"\n\n You blink. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n \"The way you played Juliet,\" he says, shrugging. \"I thought you'd hold back.\"\n\n You smile. \"Guess I surprised you.\"\n\n Jordan doesn't respond right away, but his gaze lingers for a little longer than it needs to.\n\n And maybe that says more than anything he could've said out loud.\n\n \n \n You flip open your script and breathe in slowly. Everyone always plays Juliet like she's either fragile or swept up in romantic fantasy—but you don't buy that.\n\n This scene, this moment under the balcony? It's not just about love. It's about pressure.\n\n Juliet is a girl born into a world full of rules, expectations, and politics. She's clever enough to understand the danger of what she feels—and brave enough to step into it anyway. But that doesn't mean she's going to spill her heart recklessly.\n\n She's holding herself back.\n\n You glance across the open auditorium space, where Jordan stands with his script in hand, posture steady and composed. He doesn't look at you, but he's focused. Ready.\n\n You match him, not with flash or big movement—but with tension. With the quiet intensity of someone who has a thousand things to say, and only allows a few to escape.\n\n Jordan starts.\n\n \"O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head...\"\n\n His delivery is sharp, clean, controlled—every word spoken with a deliberate pace, a simmering sort of devotion. He's practiced. A lot. But it doesn't feel rehearsed. It feels aimed.\n\n At you.\n\n You shift your stance subtly, grounding yourself. And then, softly:\n\n \"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\"\n\n You say it like it pains you to ask. Not breathless or desperate—just tired. Like you've asked this question in your head a hundred times already and you already know the answer won't change.\n\n \"Deny thy father and refuse thy name,\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\n And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\"\n\n You don't gesture or move. But your voice catches, just barely, at \"sworn my love,\" like it's the one part she wants to say but doesn't think she should.\n\n Jordan's eyes lift from his script just slightly. He doesn't break character, he would never, but you feel it. He's definitely listening.\n\n \"Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\"\n\n You glance away, like Juliet can feel something building behind her ribs and needs to look somewhere else to keep it contained.\n\n \"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.\"\n\n The words come low, even, but the longer the line goes, the more your voice tenses.\n\n \"What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,\n Nor arm, nor face...\"\n\n You trail off for just a breath, then bite back the next part. When it comes, it's sharper.\n\n \"O, be some other name belonging to a man.\"\n \n Not angry.\n \n Frustrated.\n \n Frustrated that the world is this way. That this—a name—might keep them apart.\n\n \"What's in a name? That which we call a rose\n By any other word would smell as sweet.\"\n\n You let the line linger. it feels true, even if Juliet's only just beginning to understand it.\n\n \"So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,\n Retain that dear perfection which he owes\n Without that title.\"\n\n You let the pause linger after perfection. Like she knows she shouldn't be thinking of him that way but can't help herself.\n\n And then, almost like you're daring him to hear it:\n\n \"Romeo, doff thy name,\n And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,\n Take all myself.\"\n\n Your voice doesn't rise or crack, but the stillness of it makes the line hit even harder.\n\n You don't offer Juliet like a gift, but rather reveal her like a secret.\n\n Silence.\n\n The nervous girl is staring at you, Mr. Bennet doesn't say a word, and even the room feels like it's holding its breath.\n\n Jordan stares at you like he sees something in you now that he hasn't before.\n\n He nods. Once.\n\n The moment breaks not with silence, but with a gasp.\n\n Mr. Bennet places a hand to his chest like he's just witnessed the Second Coming. He stumbles forward a step, his scarf fluttering behind him like a trailing banner of emotion.\n\n \"Simmering!\" he exclaims, voice trembling with theatrical awe. \"Controlled! And yet—undeniable!\"\n\n A few students chuckle quietly.\n\n You blink, pulling yourself out of character, breath catching as the weight of the moment shifts.\n\n Jordan steps a little closer. He doesn't shower you with praise. Doesn't offer a grin or a clap on the back.\n\n Just says, low and even, \"That version of her? That worked.\"\n\n You glance at him. \"Yeah?\"\n\n He shrugs, eyes still fixed ahead. \"Didn't expect it. But yeah.\"\n\n From Jordan, that's about as warm as it gets.\n\n And honestly? You'll take it.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

She's still standing there, flipping through the pages too fast to be absorbing anything, her fingers gripping the edges a little too tightly.\n\nShe doesn't look like she's going to approach anyone.\n\nSo you decide to take the lead.\n\n\"Hey,\" you say, stepping closer. \"Need a partner?\"\n\nHer head snaps up so quickly you almost feel bad for startling her. Wide brown eyes blink up at you, startled at first, then softening into relief. \"Oh—uh—yes. I do.\" She pauses, then lets out a nervous laugh. \"Kind of thought I'd end up reading alone for a second there.\"\n\nYou shake your head. \"Not on my watch.\"\n\nShe gives you a small, grateful smile, shifting the script in her hands. \"Thanks. I, um—sorry, I don't think we've talked before. I'm Noelle.\"\n\nNoelle. You make a mental note of it.\n\n\"I'm [name].\"\n\n\"I know,\" she blurts out, then immediately turns pink. \"I mean—not in a weird way! Just—you're in this class. I've heard Mr. Bennet say your name before.\"\n\n\"Have you been watching me from afar?\" you ask, a smirk on your face.\n\nHer face turns an even darker shade of red. \"That's not what I meant!\"\n\n\"I'm just messing with you,\" you say, laughing lightly. You couldn't help it.\n\nNoelle exhales, shoulders loosening slightly. \"Okay, okay. You had me panicking for a second.\"\n\nYou glance at the script she's holding. \"So, which one do you want to play?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" she asks, blinking.\n\n\"For the scene,\" you clarify. \"Romeo or Juliet?\"\n\nHer lips part like she hadn't even considered that part yet. \"Oh. Right. Um...\" She glances down at the pages in her hands, clearly overthinking.\n\n \n You give her a moment before speaking. \"Would you rather be the lovesick idiot or the slightly more reasonable but still doomed love interest?\"\n\n \n You give her a moment before tilting your head. \"Would you rather be the hopeless romantic who thinks love can solve everything, or the one who actually has some sense—until she doesn't?\"\n \n\nThat gets a small laugh out of her. \"Well, when you put it that way.\"\n\nShe hesitates. \"I mean, I guess it makes sense for me to play Juliet, but if you want to switch things up, I really wouldn't mind.\"\n\nShe's letting you decide.\n\n[Choice: I'll play Romeo]\n[Choice: I'll play Juliet]",

You'd probably pull off Juliet better than half the people in this class.\"\n\n \"Huh?\" You blink.\n\n \"What?\" Noelle asks, genuinely confused. \"Were you expecting me to freak out or something?\"\n\n You scratch your cheek, thinking about it. \"...A little?\"\n\n \"Not really,\" she says, shaking her head. \"I mean, you just kinda look the part already.\"\n\n Your stomach tenses slightly at that, but you decide to play it off.\n\n \"Guess I should've expected that.\"\n\n \"Okay. So, uh. You be Juliet, I'll be Romeo.\" She nods to herself, like she's confirming it again. \"Cool. Cool, cool, cool.\"\n\n At the front of the room, Mr. Bennet is still pacing, lost in his own dramatic monologue about the passion of Shakespeare's words, but you tune him out. Noelle shifts her weight, looking at her script like she's mentally preparing for battle.\n\n After a moment, she glances at you again, cheeks slightly pink. \"Alright, um. Let's do this.\"\n\n \n You glance at Noelle, then down at your script, tapping your fingers against the page as you consider. \"Actually... I think I'll play Juliet.\"\n\n Noelle blinks.\n\n Then blinks again.\n\n \"Wait, really?\"\n\n You shrug, like it's not a big deal. \"Sure. Why not?\"\n\n Noelle stares at you for a few seconds, like she's trying to figure out if you're messing with her. \"I mean—I did say I didn't mind, but I wasn't expecting you to actually pick Juliet.\"\n\n \"What, do I not seem like the Juliet type?\" you ask, tilting your head.\n\n Noelle hesitates. \"I mean...\" She gestures vaguely at you. \"You just seem like you'd play Romeo.\"\n\n \"Says who?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n She opens her mouth, then closes it, realizing she doesn't actually have an answer. Finally, she lets out a small laugh, shaking her head. \"Alright, alright. You wanna be Juliet? Go for it.\"\n\n You smirk. \"Glad we got that settled.\"\n\n At the front of the room, Mr. Bennet is still dramatically pacing, waving his arms as he talks about the life and passion behind Shakespeare's words. But you barely register his voice as Noelle flips through her script again, getting used to the idea.\n\n \"Okay, um—just a heads-up, I might not be the smoothest Romeo. I kind of figured I'd be Juliet, since, y'know, girl, and I wasn't really thinking about how to make Romeo work for me.\"\n\n \"Romeo's a mess anyway,\" you say, shrugging. \"Just lean into it.\"\n\n \"Alright, Juliet,\" Noelle grins, finally seeming to relax about the whole thing. \"Let's see what you got.\"\n \n\nNow comes the real question—how are you going to approach this?\n\n[Choice: Be fiery and commanding]\n[Choice: Be longing and vulnerable]\n[Choice: Be soft and sincere]\n[Choice: Be graceful and expressive]",

      "text": "Read with Noelle Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You square your stance, script in hand.\n\n Juliet might be young. She might be in love. But she is not weak.\n\n She's trapped between loyalty to her family and the overwhelming rush of her heart, but that doesn't make her passive. No—Juliet knows what she wants. She speaks with purpose, conviction, and defiance.\n\n And that's how you're going to read her.\n\n Noelle begins first, reading as Romeo.\n\n \"O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\n As is a wingèd messenger of heaven\n Unto the white-upturnèd wond'ring eyes\n Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him\n When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds\n And sails upon the bosom of the air.\"\n\n Her voice is steady, maybe a little hesitant. But that's okay—Romeo's a dreamer. Juliet, on the other hand? She's fire.\n\n You lift your chin slightly and let your voice ring out, firm and clear.\n\n \"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\"\n\n You don't sigh it. You demand it. The frustration in her voice is palpable—why does the person she loves have to be from the one family she can't be with?\n\n \"Deny thy father and refuse thy name,\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\n And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\"\n\n You point slightly with the last line, not in a dramatic stagey way, but with purpose. Juliet is not asking for permission. She's offering a deal—an ultimatum—with her whole soul behind it.\n\n Noelle looks up at you, blinking slightly. She almost misses her cue.\n\n \"Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\"\n\n You don't wait. You pace slightly, gripping the script like the words are fuel.\n\n \"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague...\"\n\n There's frustration in your tone, but it's not aimless. It's focused—Juliet's anger isn't wild, it's justified. She's tearing apart the logic of the world behind her.\n\n \"What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,\n Nor arm, nor face. O, be some other name\n Belonging to a man.\"\n\n You gesture outward, sweeping a hand as if to shove the idea of names out of the air. Each line builds momentum. Each phrase strikes harder.\n\n \"What's in a name? That which we call a rose\n By any other word would smell as sweet.\"\n\n The line isn't wistful, but rather sharp, like Juliet is poking holes in the foundations of her world.\n\n \"So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,\n Retain that dear perfection which he owes\n Without that title.\"\n\n You stare ahead, eyes focused, unwavering. This Juliet, your Juliet, doesn't just wish—she knows what could be true.\n\n And then—\n\n \"Romeo, doff thy name,\n And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,\n Take all myself.\"\n\n The final line hits like a strike. Not desperate, not begging—just real. A bold offering from someone who means it.\n\n The room goes still.\n\n Noelle lowers her script slightly, her eyes wide.\n\n \"Wow,\" she murmurs.\n\n You arch a brow, but there's a small grin tugging at your lips. \"Was I too much?\"\n\n \"No,\" she says, shaking her head. \"That was, like, powerful. I didn't know Juliet could sound like that.\"\n\n But before either of you can say more—\n\n Mr. Bennet erupts into applause.\n\n \"YES!\" he yells, twirling in place, scarf flaring behind him like a cape. \"That is what I live for! A Juliet who doesn't wilt like a flower, but burns like the sun!\"\n\n Students glance over, some startled, some entertained.\n\n Mr. Bennet turns back to you, eyes gleaming. \"Strength! Command! She does not ask—she chooses!\"\n\n You chuckle quietly at Mr. Bennet's theatrics.\n\n But then—\n\n Your eyes meet Jordan's across the room.\n\n He's watching. Intently.\n\n There's something sharp in his expression. Not judgment or amusement. But rather focus.\n\n Like he's reconsidering his opinion of you.\n\n He doesn't look away and neither do you.\n\n Mr. Bennet finally claps again, pulling the room back into motion. \"Alright, everyone! Let us continue! The stage waits for no one!\"\n\n Noelle flips back through her script. \"You really threw me off, you know.\"\n\n \"You'll get me back next time,\" you say, chuckling.\n\n A small smile grows on her face. \"Deal.\"\n\n Theater class just got a whole lot more interesting.\n\n \n \n You take a slow breath, letting your fingers rest lightly on the script. Juliet isn't just making some idle observation in this scene—she's aching. She wants something she knows she can't have, but that doesn't stop her from yearning for it anyway.\n\n This isn't about drama. It's about desperation.\n\n So you let yourself feel it.\n\n Noelle flips open her script and takes a breath before speaking.\n\n \"O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\n As is a wingèd messenger of heaven\n Unto the white-upturnèd wond'ring eyes\n Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him\n When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds\n And sails upon the bosom of the air.\"\n\n Her voice is steady, but you barely even register it, too caught up in what Juliet is feeling at this exact moment.\n\n You inhale and begin.\n\n \"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\"\n\n The words come out soft—softer than a whisper, like Juliet is pleading with the universe to change something that can't be changed.\n\n \"Deny thy father and refuse thy name,\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\n And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\"\n\n You let your voice tremble just slightly, like Juliet already knows how impossible this is. Like she's saying it because she has to, because keeping it inside would hurt too much.\n\n Noelle hesitates—just for a second—before remembering her next line.\n\n \"Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\"\n\n You close your eyes briefly before continuing, like Juliet is trying not to break under the weight of her own emotions.\n\n \"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague...\"\n\n Your breath catches slightly, but you don't fight it—you let the emotion seep through, let Juliet's helplessness fill the words.\n\n \"What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,\n Nor arm, nor face. O, be some other name\n Belonging to a man.\"\n\n You press a hand lightly against your chest as you speak, like Juliet is physically holding in something overwhelming, like she's trying to hold herself together.\n\n \"What's in a name? That which we call a rose\n By any other word would smell as sweet.\"\n\n You barely get the words out, your voice shaking as you speak—not from nerves, but from feeling the ache behind them.\n\n \"So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,\n Retain that dear perfection which he owes\n Without that title.\"\n\n You let out a breath, quiet but heavy.\n\n And then—\n\n \"Romeo, doff thy name,\n And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,\n Take all myself.\"\n\n The words break slightly at the end, raw and full of longing, like Juliet is giving something away that she knows she shouldn't, but she can't stop herself.\n\n And then—silence.\n\n Noelle is staring.\n\n The room isn't completely silent—other students are still reading, whispering, and shuffling papers—but in your space, in this moment, it feels like there's nothing else.\n\n Noelle swallows. \"...Wow.\"\n\n Her grip on the script is loose now, like she forgot she was holding it.\n\n You exhale, letting Juliet's emotions settle, pulling yourself back into the present. \"Good wow?\"\n\n Noelle shakes her head, still processing. \"No, like—damn. That was... intense.\"\n\n You smirk slightly. \"Well, Juliet's got a lot going on.\"\n\n Before Noelle can respond, a loud clap rings through the room.\n\n Mr. Bennet stands at the front, shining with delight, one hand over his heart, the other flung out dramatically. \"Oh! Oh, the yearning! The ache! That is the sound of love that hurts as much as it burns.\"\n\n He spins toward the rest of the class. \"Did you see it? Feel it? That, my dear students, is the weight of love denied!\"\n\n Noelle groans. \"Oh God. He's having a moment.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet wipes an imaginary tear. \"A moment, indeed.\"\n\n You chuckle, but then—\n\n You feel eyes on you.\n\n Jordan.\n\n He's watching.\n\n His arms are crossed, but his posture is different—he's leaning forward slightly, studying you with something deeper than mild interest. He doesn't say anything, but his gaze lingers, like he's assessing you.\n\n Noelle finally exhales, shaking her head. \"Okay, yeah. I definitely need to step up my game.\"\n\n \"Guess that means we're practicing,\" you joke, smirking.\n\n She huffs a laugh, but the look in her eyes isn't exasperation, but rather something excited.\n\n Mr. Bennet claps his hands. \"Onward, my students! There is so much more to discover!\"\n\n Theater class is definitely going to be interesting.\n\n \n \n You take a take a steady breath, letting your fingers loosen their grip on the script. There's no need for grand gestures or exaggerated drama—because this moment isn't about spectacle.\n\n It's about honesty.\n\n Juliet isn't standing on her balcony delivering a rehearsed speech. She isn't trying to be poetic or larger than life. She's just thinking out loud, talking to herself, wishing for something impossible.\n\n And that's how you're going to play her.\n\n Noelle watches you for a moment, then clears her throat and starts.\n\n \"O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\n As is a wingèd messenger of heaven\n Unto the white-upturnèd wond'ring eyes\n Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him\n When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds\n And sails upon the bosom of the air.\"\n \n Her voice is steady but a little hesitant, like she's still getting used to the words. But there's something earnest in it, something that makes it clear she's trying.\n\n You glance down at your script, then let out a slow breath before speaking.\n\n \"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\"\n\n Your voice is soft and quiet, like Juliet is speaking more to herself than anyone else. You don't force the line into something theatrical—you just say it the way someone lost in thought would.\n\n \"Deny thy father and refuse thy name,\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\n And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\"\n\n You don't look at Noelle as you say it, because Juliet isn't aware she's being watched. You let the words slip out naturally, like they're secrets carried on the night air.\n\n There's a brief pause.\n\n You glance up just in time to see something change in Noelle's expression. Her grip on her script eases and her shoulders relax slightly. And when she takes her next line, her voice is quieter and more thoughtful—like your delivery shifted something in her approach.\n\n \"Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\"\n\n You inhale and keep going, your voice carrying a softness that lingers in the air.\n\n \"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague...\"\n\n You don't overthink the words. You don't try to perform them. You just believe them.\n\n Juliet isn't bitter here—she's hopeful. She's trying to make sense of something that shouldn't make any sense. So you let that emotion settle into your tone, that quiet, aching kind of hope.\n\n Noelle watches you closely now, eyes flickering between you and the script, like she's seeing Juliet in a way she hadn't before.\n\n \"What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,\n Nor arm, nor face. O, be some other name\n Belonging to a man.\"\n\n You shake your head slightly as you say it, as if Juliet is frustrated that the world is so stubborn, so caught up in things that shouldn't matter.\n\n \"What's in a name? That which we call a rose\n By any other word would smell as sweet.\"\n\n Your voice dips even softer on the last few words, like you're turning them over in your head, feeling the weight of them.\n\n \"So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,\n Retain that dear perfection which he owes\n Without that title.\"\n\n You hesitate just for a second, then close your eyes briefly, like Juliet is letting herself believe for just a moment that things could be different. That names could be nothing. That love could be simple.\n\n \"Romeo, doff thy name,\n And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,\n Take all myself.\"\n\n The words leave your lips like an exhale, like Juliet is giving herself to this idea before she even realizes she's said it out loud.\n\n And then—silence.\n\n The room isn't dead silent, but it feels like it is.\n\n You glance at Noelle and she's staring.\n\n Not in a bad way—more like she wasn't expecting that.\n\n She blinks once, then shakes her head slightly, a quiet laugh escaping. \"Wow, okay. I really need to step up my game.\"\n\n \"You did well though,\" you say, raising an eyebrow.\n\n \"No, you did well,\" she responds. \"I was just reading. You actually felt it.\"\n\n \"That's kind of the point, isn't it?\" you ask.\n\n Before she can respond, a sudden clap cuts through the air.\n\n Mr. Bennet stands at the front of the room, both hands pressed dramatically over his chest. \"Ohh, my dear students, what a gift you have given me!\" He spins on his heel, scarf fluttering. \"A Juliet so sincere, so honest! Not a performance, but a confession!\"\n\n He turns to Noelle. \"And my dear Romeo, you must listen—not just speak! Feel the words in your heart, not just on your tongue!\"\n\n \"Oh my God, he's right,\" Noelle groans. \"I was just saying the words.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet nods, satisfied. \"But you see it now! And that is the first step!\"\n\n A few students chuckle under their breath, but there's something different about the energy in the room now—like people are actually paying attention.\n\n And Jordan?\n\n He's watching, too.\n\n He doesn't say anything, but the way he studies you and the way his eyes linger says enough.\n\n You got his attention.\n\n Mr. Bennet claps his hands again. \"Alright! Let us continue, my dear students! There is so much more to discover in these words!\"\n\n As the class moves on, Noelle lets out a breath and glances at you again. \"Alright, I have to get better at this.\"\n\n You smirk. \"Guess that means we'll just have to practice more.\"\n\n She blinks, then smiles. \"Yeah, I guess we will.\"\n\n Something about the way she says it makes you think she's actually excited about it.\n\n Theater class is definitely going to be interesting.\n\n \n \n You take a slow breath. Juliet's words aren't meant to be spoken stiffly, trapped on the page. No, they're meant to move, to flow. She isn't standing still in the scene; she's caught up in something bigger than herself, emotions too overwhelming to contain.\n\n So you're not going to just say the words.\n\n You're going to live them.\n\n Noelle starts first, reading as Romeo. Her voice is steady, but she's still adjusting to the role, still finding her rhythm.\n\n \"O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\n As is a wingèd messenger of heaven\n Unto the white-upturnèd wond'ring eyes\n Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him\n When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds\n And sails upon the bosom of the air.\"\n\n You let the words settle before stepping into the moment.\n\n Without hesitation, you shift your weight, lifting your head like you're gazing out into the night. And then, as if the words are being pulled from you by something you can't control, you let them spill out.\n\n \"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\"\n\n Your voice is soft but searching, your whole body moving with the words—first stepping lightly to the side, then turning your face toward an unseen sky, as if reaching for something just out of grasp.\n\n \"Deny thy father and refuse thy name,\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\n And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\"\n\n You let your hands follow the emotions, palms opening slightly as if letting something slip through your fingers—like Juliet is trying to let go of reality but can't quite manage it.\n\n Noelle watches you closely, taking a second before she remembers her next line.\n\n \"Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\"\n\n You take another step, slow and deliberate, as if Juliet is moving with her thoughts, carried by them.\n\n \"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague...\"\n\n You pause between the words, turning slightly, as if pacing through your own frustration.\n \n \"What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,\n Nor arm, nor face.\"\n\n As you speak, you gesture absently, like trying to physically rid yourself of the idea, like trying to shake off the weight of a name that shouldn't matter.\n\n \"O, be some other name\n Belonging to a man.\"\n\n Your voice dips quieter in the second half, fingers pressing against your chest, like Juliet is realizing that even though she wants to believe names don't matter, the world says otherwise.\n\n Noelle inhales slightly, watching your movements instead of just listening.\n\n You take another slow step as you continue.\n\n \"What's in a name? That which we call a rose\n By any other word would smell as sweet.\"\n\n You lift your hand slightly, fingers trailing through the air as if you're tracing invisible petals, your voice light but wistful.\n\n \"So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,\n Retain that dear perfection which he owes,\n Without that title.\"\n\n You let yourself breathe between each thought, turning your face upward slightly, like you're hoping the universe itself will agree with you.\n\n And then, with the greatest exhale, you close your eyes and whisper the final plea.\n\n \"Romeo, doff thy name,\n And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,\n Take all myself.\"\n\n Your hands press lightly over your heart as you say it, as if offering something tangible, something real—before, slowly, you let them fall back to your sides, the words lingering in the space between you and Noelle.\n\n Silence.\n\n Noelle is staring at you, script slightly lowered.\n\n She blinks once, then exhales like she forgot to breathe. \"Oh. Wow.\"\n\n \"Good wow?\" you ask, shaking off the moment.\n\n She nods slowly. \"That was... really pretty, yeah. Like, the way you moved with it? That was good.\"\n\n Before you can answer, Mr. Bennet suddenly claps, loud and delighted.\n\n \"Ahh! Now we have a Juliet who moves!\" His scarf flutters as he spins on his heel. \"The words are not just spoken! They are felt! They take shape! They breathe!\"\n\n He turns to the rest of the class, eyes gleaming. \"This, my dear students, is the art of theater! The body tells the story as much as the voice.\"\n\n Noelle lets out a breath and shakes her head. \"I'm going to have to step up my game if I want that kind of praise from Mr. Bennet.\"\n\n \"We should practice,\" you say, grinning.\n\n \"Yeah, I think we should,\" she replies, a small smile growing on her face.\n\n And then—\n\n You feel it again.\n\n A gaze lingering.\n\n Jordan.\n\n He's not just watching. He's assessing, like he's picking apart every moment, every choice you just made. His arms are still crossed, but he's sitting up now, leaning forward slightly.\n\n He doesn't say a word. But the way he looks at you says enough.\n\n Mr. Bennet claps his hands again. \"Alright, my dear thespians! Let us continue! There is so much more to discover!\"\n\n Theater class is a lot of things, but you realize one can never call it boring.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

If you're going to do this, you might as well do it right. Romeo isn't some timid, lovesick fool—he's dramatic and confident, a guy who would literally die for romance. He sneaks into a deadly enemy's garden in the middle of the night to talk to a girl he literally just met. He's not holding back.\n\n So neither will you.\n\n You glance at Noelle. \"Ready?\"\n\n She swallows, gripping her script. \"Uh—yeah. I think.\"\n\n You smirk. \"Good.\" Then, without hesitation, you step forward, lift your chin, and let the words take over.\n\n \"O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\n As is a wingèd messenger of heaven\n Unto the white-upturnèd wond'ring eyes\n Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him\n When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds\n And sails upon the bosom of the air.\"\n\n Your voice is smooth, confident—not just reciting but commanding the words. You tilt your head up slightly, like you're actually staring up at Juliet's balcony, like you're completely enchanted by her. You let the lines flow naturally, each one filled with admiration, with a touch of teasing charm—like Romeo knows he's irresistible.\n\n Noelle blinks. Her grip on the script tightens. You're surprised she hasn't ripped the poor thing by now.\n\n For a second, it looks like she forgets what she's supposed to say.\n\n You raise an eyebrow slightly, waiting.\n\n She lets out a breath, cheeks slightly pink, and finally speaks.\n\n \"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\n Deny thy father and refuse thy name,\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\n And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\"\n\n You smirk, stepping closer, lowering your voice just enough to make the next line sound conspiratorial.\n\n \"Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\"\n\n Noelle inhales sharply—whether because of the line or because she wasn't expecting you to deliver it like that, you're not sure.\n\n But you are sure that you have her attention.\n\n Her voice is a little steadier now, but you can tell she's quickly finding her footing.\n\n \"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague...\"\n\n You nod slightly as she gains confidence, letting her have the moment while keeping your presence strong too. When she finally reaches her last line, \"Take all myself,\" you don't hesitate.\n\n You place a hand over your heart, grinning as if you've just won the greatest prize in the world.\n\n \"I take thee at thy word.\n Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized.\n Henceforth I never will be Romeo.\"\n\n You deliver it with certainty, full of devotion, like of course you would throw away your entire identity for this girl. You stand tall, as if daring the world to challenge your love.\n\n And then—silence.\n\n Noelle stares at you, wide-eyed, her script slightly lowered.\n\n A few students, clearly eavesdropping from their own readings, exchange glances.\n\n Even Mr. Bennet is watching you now, one hand over his heart, the other clutching his scarf like he might actually swoon.\n\n But the reaction that stands out most?\n\n Jordan.\n\n His arms are crossed as he studies you. It's not disapproval. If anything... it looks like interest.\n\n Noelle finally breaks the silence with a nervous laugh. \"Uh. Wow.\"\n\n You grin. \"Good wow or bad wow?\"\n\n She huffs, still pink-faced. \"You really committed to that, huh?\"\n\n \"Romeo doesn't half-ass things,\" you say, shrugging. \"Why should I?\"\n\n She exhales, shaking her head, but there's a smile on her face now. \"Okay. Well. Now I feel like I should actually act instead of just reading.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet suddenly claps his hands together, stepping forward. \"Oh, magnificent! That is the kind of energy we need! Passion! Charm! A Romeo who dares to love so boldly!\"\n\n He turns to Noelle. \"And my dear Juliet, your hesitancy was not a flaw—it was real! The push and pull of love! The awe of realizing someone sees you so intensely!\"\n\n Noelle gives you a slightly exasperated look. \"Yeah, well, it's hard not to react when Romeo is practically flirting with the whole room.\"\n\n \"I had to keep the audience engaged,\" you reply, smirking.\n\n Mr. Bennet claps his hands. \"Exactly! Yes!\"\n\n A few students chuckle, and Noelle shakes her head, but she looks more relaxed now—like some of her nerves have melted away.\n\n \"Alright, my dear thespians, let us continue!\" Mr. Bennet announces. \"The words are alive—now let's see who else dares to embrace them!\"\n\n As he moves on, you catch Jordan watching you again. He doesn't say anything, opting to just lift an eyebrow, like he's acknowledging what you did.\n\n You nod back, just a little.\n\n Yeah. Theater class is shaping up to be pretty fun.\n\n \n \n You flip open the script, but instead of focusing on the words, you focus on what Romeo must be feeling at this moment.\n\n This isn't just some overdramatic love confession. This is desperation. This is a boy who is already lost in this girl, standing under the stars, begging the universe to make this love real. He's overwhelmed, completely consumed.\n\n And that's how you're going to read it.\n\n You inhale, steady yourself, and let the emotion take over.\n\n \"O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\n As is a wingèd messenger of heaven\n Unto the white-upturnèd wond'ring eyes\n Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him\n When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds\n And sails upon the bosom of the air.\"\n\n Your voice is low at first, almost reverent, as if you can't believe Juliet is even real. Then you let it build, filled with longing, with a quiet ache—like Romeo isn't just speaking these words, but pleading with the heavens to listen.\n\n Noelle stiffens slightly, eyes wide.\n\n She grips her script tighter, and you can tell she wasn't expecting this.\n\n For a second, she forgets to speak.\n\n You glance at her, breaking character just enough to give her space. She blinks, inhales sharply, and finally finds her voice.\n\n \"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\n Deny thy father and refuse thy name,\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\n And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\"\n\n Her voice wavers a little, but that actually works—like Juliet herself is struggling against something too big to understand.\n\n You take the next line \"Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\" and make it quiet and breathless, like Romeo is afraid of ruining the moment but cannot stay silent any longer.\n\n Noelle exhales, steadying herself. She pushes forward, her voice growing stronger as she speaks.\n\n \"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague...\"\n\n You barely notice the rest of the class anymore. It's just you and her with the weight of these words filling the space between you.\n\n And then she reaches her last line—\"Take all myself.\"\n\n Your breath catches slightly. You don't even have to think before answering.\n\n Your voice comes out firm, filled with certainty, devotion, and something raw that Romeo himself probably doesn't understand yet.\n\n \"I take thee at thy word.\n Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized.\n Henceforth I never will be Romeo.\"\n\n The words hang in the air like they mean something. Like they matter.\n\n Silence.\n\n Noelle stares at you, mouth slightly open, her script lowered.\n\n Somewhere in the room, a few students—who were clearly eavesdropping—exchange glances.\n\n Mr. Bennet has one hand over his mouth, eyes practically shimmering.\n\n And Jordan—\n\n Jordan is watching.\n\n His eyes are focused and his jaw is set as he studies you with something serious in his expression. A kind of respect, almost.\n\n Finally, Noelle clears her throat, looking completely flustered. \"Wow. Um. Wow.\"\n\n You let out a breath, still feeling the last traces of Romeo's desperation in your chest. \"Is that the good kind of wow?\"\n\n She blinks. \"I mean, yeah! You really felt that.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet suddenly claps his hands together, looking utterly exchanged. \"Oh, magnificent! That—that is what I mean when I say feel the words! The ache, the devotion, the gravity of love itself!\" He gestures wildly. \"You did not merely speak Romeo's heart—you bled it!\"\n\n Noelle shakes her head, still looking overwhelmed. \"Yeah, no kidding.\"\n\n \"Romeo is kind of a mess,\" you saying trying to shake off the intensity. \"Might as well embrace it, right?\"\n\n Mr. Bennet sighs dramatically, pressing a hand to his heart. \"Oh, if only all my students were so willing to embrace emotion!\"\n\n You glance at Jordan again. He still hasn't said anything. But he gives you the smallest nod, like he sees what you just did.\n\n And honestly? That feels better than any compliment.\n\n The scene is over, but something about it lingers.\n\n \n \n You glance over the script, rolling your shoulders back. Some people might go all-in with grand gestures or dramatic intensity, but that's not how you see Romeo.\n\n You don't see Romeo as delivering a speech to a crowd or making some grand declaration for the world to hear.\n\n He's just a guy, standing in the middle of the night, talking to someone who makes him feel different—someone who makes him want to say things he's never said before.\n\n And that's exactly how you're going to read it.\n\n You exhale and step into the role like it's something comfortable.\n\n \"O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\n As is a wingèd messenger of heaven\n Unto the white-upturnèd wond'ring eyes\n Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him\n When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds\n And sails upon the bosom of the air.\"\n\n Your voice is steady and warm—not overly dramatic, not exaggerated. Just real. You let the words fall naturally, like Romeo isn't thinking too hard about them, rather just saying what he feels.\n\n Noelle blinks, her grip on the script loosening slightly.\n\n She hesitates for a moment, but then, she lets out a breath and matches your energy.\n\n \"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\n Deny thy father and refuse thy name,\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\n And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\"\n\n You smirk slightly, lowering your voice just enough to make the next line sound like a casual thought slipping out.\n \n \"Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\"\n\n Noelle exhales a quiet laugh, like she wasn't expecting that delivery but kind of likes it.\n\n She presses forward, her words growing more confident.\n\n \"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague...\"\n\n The conversation flows, easy and natural. Like Romeo and Juliet aren't two grand, tragic figures, but just two people in the middle of a moment neither of them fully understands yet.\n\n By the time Noelle reaches her last line—\"Take all myself,\"—she sounds comfortable. Like she's not worried about messing up anymore.\n\n You tilt your head slightly, grinning as you reply.\n\n \"I take thee at thy word.\n Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized.\n Henceforth I never will be Romeo.\"\n\n The words come out genuine. No forced weight behind them, no exaggerated performance—just something honest. Like Romeo truly believes that if Juliet asked him to, he'd drop everything and be something new, and he wouldn't even hesitate.\n\n For a second, there's silence.\n\n Then, Noelle lets out a quiet giggle, shaking her head. \"That actually felt... kinda real.\"\n\n \"Maybe because it is?\" you ask, shrugging.\n\n She looks down at her script, a thoughtful expression crossing her face. \"Huh.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet, who had been watching very closely, sighs dramatically, pressing his hands together. \"Oh, brilliant! You strip away the grandeur, and suddenly, the words breathe!\" He gestures wildly. \"Yes! That is the beauty of Shakespeare! It does not need embellishment—it needs truth!\"\n\n \"Guess you nailed that, then,\" Noelle says, glancing at you.\n\n \"I just read the words,\" you reply. \"Romeo's the one who did all the work.\"\n\n Mr. Bennet wipes an imaginary tear from his eye before turning back to the rest of the class. \"Let this be a lesson, my dear students! Shakespeare is not meant to be recited—it is meant to be lived!\"\n\n A few students chuckle, but the energy in the room has shifted—it's almost as if people are actually starting to engage with the material.\n\n And Jordan?\n\n Jordan is watching.\n\n His expression is unreadable at first, but then, after a beat, he gives you the smallest nod—like he gets what you were doing.\n\n And somehow, that makes the whole thing feel all the more real.\n\n \n \n You roll your shoulders back, letting out a breath as you flip to the right page in the script. Some people might read Romeo's words as poetry, something delicate and beautiful—but you see something more alive in them. Romeo isn't just reciting lines in his head. He's feeling every word and moving with every thought.\n\n And that's how you're going to play him.\n\n Noelle stands beside you, gripping her script, but you're already stepping forward, shifting your weight like you're actually standing in the shadows of Juliet's balcony, looking up at her.\n\n Then you start.\n\n \"O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\n As is a wingèd messenger of heaven\n Unto the white-upturnèd wond'ring eyes\n Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him\n When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds\n And sails upon the bosom of the air.\"\n\n You don't just say the words—you live them. You gesture upward as if you're truly seeing Juliet above you, your expression shifting with every thought, like Romeo himself is overwhelmed by what he's looking at. You step lightly, pacing slightly, your body restless with emotion, like there's too much inside you to stay still.\n\n Noelle blinks, visibly startled by your energy, but she quickly catches up.\n\n \"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\n Deny thy father and refuse thy name,\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\n And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\"\n\n As she speaks, you react—not just with your face, but with your entire body. When she asks, wherefore art though Romeo?, you lift a hand slightly, almost as if wanting to reach for her but stopping yourself. Your expression flickers, thoughtful, longing.\n\n Then, when you take your next line—\"Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\"—you shift closer, as if Romeo is caught between staying hidden and stepping forward. The words are spoken softly, but your body is tense, charged with the urge to move.\n\n Noelle inhales slightly, but keeps going.\n\n \"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague...\"\n\n You nod slightly as if agreeing with her words, as if they physically make sense to Romeo. And when she reaches her final line—\"Take all myself.\"—you don't hesitate.\n\n You take a step closer, one hand pressing over your heart.\n\n \"I take thee at thy word.\n Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized.\n Henceforth I never will be Romeo.\"\n\n You let the final words sink in, exhaling slowly, like Romeo has just made a life-altering decision in real-time.\n\n Silence.\n\n Noelle stares at you, script half-lowered, her breath slightly uneven—like she wasn't expecting you to move so much, to be so present in the scene.\n\n And the rest of the class?\n\n They noticed.\n\n You hear a few murmurs, a few whispers, but most of all—you see Mr. Bennet, hands clasped together, eyes gleaming with approval.\n\n \"Oh! Oh! That—that was feeling!\" He gestured wildly toward you. \"That was not just words on a page! That was physicality! That was presence!\" He turns to the rest of the class. \"Did you see? Did you feel it? This, my dear students, is theater!\"\n\n Some students laugh but others actually look interested now.\n\n Noelle shakes her head slightly, still looking a little overwhelmed. \"Wow. You, uh—you really get into it, huh?\"\n\n \"Romeo isn't exactly the kind of guy who sits still and thinks it over,\" you reply with a grin.\n\n She exhales a laugh. \"Yeah, no kidding.\"\n\n And then, just when you think the moment is over, you catch something else—\n\n Jordan.\n\n He's not just watching. He's studying you.\n\n His arms are crossed, but his posture isn't closed off like usual. He looks... thoughtful.\n\n Impressed, even.\n\n He doesn't say anything, but the way his gaze lingers makes something clear:\n\n You caught his attention.\n\n Mr. Bennet claps his hands again. \"Alright, my dear students! Let us continue! Let the words live!\"\n\n As the class shifts back to work, you can still feel the energy of the scene lingering in the air.\n\n Theater class is definitely going to be interesting.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Your pen taps softly against your notebook, rhythm uneven.\n\nAcross the library, Vincent is quiet. He hasn't moved in a while. He's tucked himself behind a shelf near the windows, slouched slightly in his chair, a history book open in front of him and a closed one resting against his elbow.\n\nHe's not really reading, though. You can tell.\n\nEvery now and then, he flips a page without looking at it.\n\nYou glance up just as he runs a hand through his hair—twice, slow and nervous. Then, he scribbles something quickly in the margin of his notebook, only to stare at it for a few seconds before turning back to the book.\n\nYou look down again, at your own notes. Try to get through a few practice questions.\n\nBut the silence around you doesn't feel calming anymore. It feels... heavy.\n\nYou told yourself you needed to focus.

Then his face lights up so suddenly, so completely, that it's blinding.\n\n\"R-Really?\" he stammers, blinking fast. \"I mean—cool. Great. Yes.

I'll even help with math, and I hate math, which I know is ironic because I also love astronomy and that's basically space math, but—\"\n\nYou laugh. Not at him, but because of him. Because it's hard not to laugh when someone's this earnestly happy just to sit beside you.\n\nVincent pauses mid-ramble, cheeks flushing as he realizes he's been talking too much. He looks down at his notes like they might rescue him.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he mumbles. \"I—I do that. Sometimes. A lot. People just aren't usually willing to study with me.\"\n\nYou glance over at him. \"You're good. I don't mind.\"\n\nHe peeks up at you. \"Thanks,\" he says quietly.\n\n[Choice: Study with Vincent]",

Not in a distracting way—just... in a Vincent way. A soft murmur of thoughts shared aloud, sometimes about the assignment, sometimes about whatever historical tangent he's wandered into next.\n\n\"Did you know Newton basically wrote more about alchemy than he did about physics?\" he mumbles at one point, scribbling something down in the margins of his notebook. \"People think of him as this ultra-rational Enlightenment guy, but he was obsessed with turning lead into gold and finding secret divine codes in the Bible. Like—he really thought he was going to unlock the universe with that!\"\n\nYou glance over. \"That sounds completely unhinged.\"\n\nVincent beams. \"Right? It's kind of amazing. People are complicated like that.\"\n\nHe returns to his notes, bouncing his foot under the table like it's connected to his brain. A few minutes pass, both of you focused, the silence between you filled only with the soft scratch of pencils and the distant hum of a library printer starting up.\n\nThen, quieter, he says, \"Do you ever think about, like... next year?\"\n\nThe question slips out so softly it almost blends into the background. You glance up from your notes to find Vincent still hunched over his textbook, pencil resting against his lips. He doesn't look at you—not really. Just sort of stares past his own perfect handwriting like he's halfway inside his own head.\n\nYou decide to wait for a moment before answering, unsure if he even meant for you to answer. But he fills the silence himself before you can say anything.\n\n\"I mean... senior year feels like it's going by so fast. And I know that's what everyone says, but...\" He lets out a nervous laugh, barely audible. \"It really is.\"\n\n\"I keep looking at college stuff,\" he continues, his voice low and steady now, \"but every time I pull up a website or try to work on my applications, I just... I freeze. Like, what if I pick the wrong place? What if I don't even get accepted anywhere? OR what if I do, but I don't belong there, or I mess it up, or—\"\n\nHe cuts himself off and gives a sheepish smile, still not meeting your eyes. \"Sorry. Rambling again.\"\n\nBut he isn't really.\n\nYou watch him for a second and it's clear he's scared of not knowing where he's going or who he'll be a year from now. It's the kind of fear that's quiet, slow, and heavy in the chest.\n\n\"I just thought I'd have it more figured out by now,\" he adds. \"How about you, [name]? Do you know what you want to do?\"\n\nYou sit back a little, your pencil resting against your notebook.\n\nBecause truthfully... you've been wondering the same thing.\n\n[Choice: I think I want to leave Crestview Bay]\n[Choice: I think I want to stay in Crestview Bay]",

Then you say it—softly at first, but without hesitation.\n\n \"I think I want to leave Crestview Bay.\"\n\n Vincent blinks, caught off guard. He doesn't interrupt, so you keep going, the words falling into place like pieces you didn't know were waiting to be arranged.\n\n \"I mean... I've lived here my whole life. I know every street, every shortcut, every creaky floorboard. I'm grateful for that, but sometimes it just feels like...\" You pause, searching for the right words. \"Like I'm outgrowing it. Or maybe it's outgrowing me.\"\n\n You look up, and Vincent is watching you closely now—quiet, eyes soft, pencil forgotten in his hand.\n\n \"I keep thinking about what it'd be like to go somewhere where no one knows me,\" you continue. \"Where I don't feel like I'm stuck playing this one version of myself because everyone else expects it.\"\n\n Vincent shifts, gently setting his pencil down, his brow furrowing just slightly—not in judgment, but in understanding.\n\n \"It's not that I hate it here,\" you add quickly. \"There are things I'd miss. People I'd miss. But I want to know what else is out there. What I could be if I wasn't always... this version of me.\"\n\n Vincent doesn't say anything right away, but when he does, his voice is quieter than before.\n\n \"I get that.\"\n\n He taps his fingers thoughtfully. \"Sometimes I think... if I left, I could finally breathe. Like the air wouldn't be so full of who people expect me to be who I've always been.\"\n\n You nod, the silence between you heavy but warm. He leans back in his chair, gaze drifting toward the windows.\n\n \"I think you'd do well, [name],\" he says, almost absently. \"Out there. Somewhere new. You have this certain... presence to you.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Presence?\"\n\n He flushes instantly. \"Not in a bad way. Just—like—people notice you. In a good way. Like, if anyone could go somewhere totally new and still find their footing, it'd be you.\"\n\n You smile.\n\n Crestview Bay will always be a part of you. You know that.\n\n But you're starting to believe—maybe it doesn't have to be the whole story.\n\n \n \n Stay in your Hometown Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n You sit with Vincent's question for a moment, fingers tracing the edge of your notebook, pretending to think harder than you really are. Because the truth?\n\n You already know.\n\n \"I think I want to stay in Crestview Bay.\"\n\n Vincent turns his head toward you, eyes wide—not judgmental;, just curious. A little surprised, maybe.\n\n \"Really?\"\n\n You nod. \"Yeah. I mean... I used to think I'd leave. That I should leave. Everyone says you have to get out of your hometown to find yourself, or whatever. But lately, I don't know.\"\n\n You glance around the quiet library—the warm light, the shelves with their peeling labels, the familiar creak of the back windows that never quite shut right. It's old and worn, yeah, but it's yours.\n\n \"I've got people here,\" you continue. \"People I care about. Luke, Samantha... you.\"\n\n Vincent stiffens slightly at that last word. Not in a bad way—more like someone bracing themselves against a sudden warmth.\n\n \"I don't think I'm done with this place yet,\" you say. \"There's still more for me here. Stuff I want to understand. Things I want to hold onto. And maybe... maybe I don't have to run to figure out who I am.\"\n\n Vincent stares down at his notes for a second before smiling.\n\n \"That's kind of amazing,\" he says. \"I always thought staying meant giving up. Like... settling. But the way you say it—it sounds more like choosing.\"\n\n You glance over. \"How about you? Would you want to stay?\"\n\n \"Maybe,\" Vincent replies. \"If the right people were here.\"\n\n His eyes flick toward you for the briefest moment.\n\n \"I think that'd make all the difference,\" he adds quietly.\n\n You both go quiet after that. For the first time in a while though, you don't feel stuck. You feel rooted.\n\n Maybe home isn't something you grow out of. Maybe it's something you grow with.\n \n\n[Choice: To home]",

You're weaving through it, head low, when you hear a familiar voice behind you.\n\n \"[name]. Wait.\"\n\n You stop and turn.\n\n Jessica is there, standing just off to the side near the trophy case, the light catching the edge of her top. She looks flawless, as always—but there's something tight around her eyes. Not annoyed. Not performative.\n\n Worried.\n\n She gives you a quick, almost guilty smile and tilts her head. \"Can we talk?\"\n\n You nod, and she gently tugs you toward a quiet alcove just outside the main flow of the hallway, where it's just quiet enough to feel like a private conversation.\n\n Once you're there, she crosses her arms and glances around before looking back at you.\n\n \"I didn't want to do this in public,\" she starts, voice low. \"But... what happened? In the office.\"\n\n You hesitate.\n\n She doesn't push. Instead, she just watches your face for a few seconds before sighing.\n\n \"The rumors are out of control,\" she says. \"They're saying all kinds of stuff—like you hexed Mr. Thompson, or you're faking being trans for attention, or that you're secretly trying to infiltrate the school board with a woke agenda. It's ridiculous.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"That last one sounds way too specific.\"\n\n Jessica grimaces. \"Apparently, someone's dad has a podcast. But that's not the point.\"\n\n She leans in, voice dropping even lower. \"People are already on edge about you. And if they find out you're on the cheer team—and not just helping, but actually on it... they're going to lose their minds.\"\n\n You shift. \"Yeah, I know.\"\n \n \"I mean, I've tried to get ahead,\" she says quickly. \"Told the girls to keep quiet, shut down a few rumors before they got too wild, but I don't think we can hide it forever. If Thompson finds out, or if it spreads before we're ready... he'll make it a problem.\"\n\n There's only concern in her voice.\n\n \"I don't want this to blow back to you or the team,\" she adds, softer. \"You've actually been really good out there. You didn't just help, you stepped up when we needed you. Hell, when I needed you. And I appreciate that.\"\n\n She pauses, studying you. Her usual confidence wavers for half a second.\n\n \"I just don't know how long we can hold this line.\"\n\n The hallway noise keeps moving around you, distant and muffled.\n\n \"I'm not saying we out you or make some grand announcement,\" she says earnestly. \"But... we should probably figure out how we're going to handle it. Together. Before someone else handles it for us.\"\n\n She lets the silence hang for a few moments.\n\n \"You probably have enough on your plate right now, but let's talk later, alright?\"\n\n Jessica grips your hand tight and gives you a reassuring smile before turning back and walking off into the crowd.\n<<elseif [jessicaRelo] > 29>> \n The lunch bell rings, shrill and abrupt, cutting through the noise like it's personally trying to get your attention.\n\n You're halfway down the hallway, slipping into the tide of students headed toward their next classes, when a perfectly manicured hand reaches your elbow.\n\n \"[name].\"\n\n You turn, already knowing who it is.\n\n Jessica's standing just off to the side near the trophy case. Her posture is perfect, hair tucked neatly behind one year. She's not smiling, but her expression isn't cold, either. She jerks her chin slightly, motioning for you to step aside with her—off to the edge of the hall, where it's just quiet enough to feel like a private conversation. You follow without protest.\n\n Once the two of you out of everyone's earshot, she speaks.\n\n \"What happened?\" she asks.\n\n You blink. \"What?\"\n\n \"Sorry, that was a little cold,\" she lets out a laugh. \"I meant what happened in the office with Mr. Thompson. The entire school is talking.\"\n\n You look away.\n\n \n She sighs, glancing over her shoulder before speaking.\n\n \"Hey,\" she says quietly. \"I've been keeping my ear to the ground. And things, as I'm sure you know, are getting worse.\"\n\n You don't need to ask what she means. The buzz around school hasn't stopped since lunch. You feel it in every glance and every whisper.\n\n Jessica sighs, brushing her hair behind one year. \"I told them what we agreed on. That it was estrogen. That it was medical. That you didn't want to talk about it.\" She pauses. \"It worked—for a while.\"\n\n You swallow. \"And now?\"\n\n \"Now, they're questioning it,\" she says. \"They're asking what kind of condition it could even be. Saying if it were real, you'd have a doctor's note or something to show. Some are just straight-up calling it fake.\"\n\n She looks at you, more serious now. \"I've been shutting down what I can. But I don't have control over everything. You're kind of... high-profile now. And I think everyone's sensing that something's off and that there's more to the story.\"\n\n You stay quiet. She watches you for a moment longer before softening.\n\n \"Look, I know we're not super close or whatever,\" she says, arms folded now. \"But I didn't offer to help for fun. I care, [name], and I don't want to see you get chewed up by the rumor machine.\"\n\n She's not looking at you like you're a burden or a PR problem. She's looking at you like someone who knows what it's like to be at the center of a spotlight you didn't ask for.\n\n \"You're just trying to survive high school like the rest of us. So if you need help, or space, or just someone to yell at a freshman until they cry—I'm around. Okay?\"\n\n Then she nods—firm and controlled, Jessica-style—and steps back into the crowd, slipping away with practiced ease.\n\n But her words hang in the air, heavier than you'd expect.\n \n \n She sighs, glancing over her shoulder before speaking, like she's making sure no one's listening.\n\n \"Okay, look,\" Jessica says, her voice low and uncharacteristically direct. \"I really wasn't going to say anything, but this whole thing is getting out of hand.\"\n\n You pause, unsure how to respond.\n\n \"I tried to stay out of it,\" she continues, folding her arms. \"I figured that if you wanted to explain things, you would. But people are talking, [name]. A lot.\"\n\n \"I've noticed,\" you say, laughing bitterly.\n\n \"Yeah, you're kind of the headline right now,\" she continues, eyes scanning your face. \"Like there are so many versions of the story floating around, and none of them make sense. One kid said you cursed the principal. Another thinks you're in disguise to expose the school board. The rumor mill is chewing you up and I don't think it's gonna slow down.\"\n\n She hesitates, then adds, \"Back when I offered to cover for you... I was just trying to give you breathing room. But I get why you didn't take it.\"\n\n You glance at her. There's no judgment in her face—just a guarded sincerity. She sighs and adjusts the strap of her bag, suddenly looking more tired than you're used to seeing.\n\n \"I'm not here to tell you what to do, but the rumors will only get worse from here. And if it gets out of hand, you'll get hurt.\"\n\n She pauses, then meets your eyes.\n\n \"I don't want that to be you. So if you need help, or space, or just someone to yell at a freshman until they cry—I'm around. Okay?\"\n\n She doesn't wait for a thank you or even a response. Just nods once, like she's said her piece, and walks off down the hall.\n\n But she meant it.\n\n And that means something.\n \n\n \n The lunch bell rings a little too loudly.\n\n You're halfway down the hallway, blending into the tide of students heading toward your next classes, when a perfectly manicured hand grabs your elbow.\n\n \"[name].\"\n\n You stop, startled, and turn to see Jessica standing just off to the side of the hall, near the trophy case. She's blonde, poised, and unbothered as always. Her outfit is flawless because of course it is.\n\n She doesn't smile.\n\n She jerks her chin slightly, motioning for you to step aside with her—away from the stream of students. You go. She crosses her arms once you're out of everyone's earshot, scanning you quickly. It's not in a kind way but not in a mean way either. Just... calculating.\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n You blink. \"What?\"\n\n \"In the office with Mr. Thompson,\" she says, voice low. \"Everyone's talking. You know that, right?\"\n\n You don't answer.\n\n She sighs and glances over her shoulder like she's already regretting having this conversation.\n\n \n \"Look, I covered for you,\" she says, quieter now. \"I did what I could.\"\n\n You tense slightly.\n\n \"I told people you were on estrogen for a medical reason. That it was private. That you didn't want to talk about it. Most of them bought it—at least, enough to make them back off.\"\n\n There's a pause.\n \n \"But it's starting to fall apart,\" she says, folding her arms. \"People are bored, and when they're bored, they start poking holes.\"\n\n You glance down the hall. You can still hear the faint buzz of conversation.\n\n Jessica's tone sharpens just a little. \"I had three people ask me today if you're actually sick. One girl said she looked up hormone replacement therapy on Google and now she's playing doctor. You're turning into a game of telephone and I'm not gonna be the one answering for it.\"\n\n \"Are you telling me you're done?\"\n\n She exhales through her nose. \"I'm telling you I can't control it anymore, [name]. I gave them something to chew on so you didn't have to say anything yourself. But it's been a week. The stakes have gotten higher. And you can't hang everything on a lie forever. Even on that sounds halfway medical.\"\n\n There's no venom in her voice. But no warmth, either. Just a kind of exhausted edge—like she's burned more energy than she planned defending someone she barely knows.\n\n \"You don't have to tell me what exactly is going on with you,\" she says, softer now. \"But if you want people to stop turning you into the latest gossip dump, you need to figure out what story you're actually trying to tell.\"\n\n She shifts her bag onto her shoulder.\n\n \"I've done what I can.\"\n\n Then she turns, walking back into the crowd without looking back.\n \n \n \"Look, I don't know what you told people. I don't want to know, honestly. But the rumors are insane right now. Some freshman asked me if you were transitioning. Another kid said you hexed Principal Thompson at the Autumn Festival. Someone else said you're suing the school for gender discrimination.\"\n\n You frown. \"None of that's—\"\n\n \"I know it's not true,\" she cuts in. \"But you're kind of the center of everyone's gossip playlist right now, and I can't exactly shut it down anymore. Not without making it worse.\"\n\n Her voice is laced with frustration. Not even at you, necessarily—more like at the situation.\n\n \"I tried to help last week,\" she continues, folding her arms tighter. \"Told a few people to back off. Said you were going through something that wasn't their business. But it's spiraled. People love drama, [name].\"\n\n She shifts her weight, eyes scanning your face again. Not cruel. Just tired. Distant.\n\n \"I don't know what's actually going on with you,\" she says. \"And we're not exactly close, so... yeah. I'm not going to pretend I'm in your corner or anything.\"\n\n That stings more than you expect, even if it's true.\n\n \"But I am telling you this: whatever happened in the principal's office? You need to be careful. Everyone's watching and you're gonna have a target on your back.\"\n\n You glance away.\n\n She doesn't offer comfort. She doesn't offer to help. She just steps back, adjusting the strap on her bag.\n\n \"Just be careful, [name].\"\n\n And then she walks off into the crowd, back straight and expression already reset.\n\n Like nothing ever happened.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Her hands are delicately moving over a patch of dirt, fingers curled like she's doing something very specific and very intentional. Her nails are painted a matte-black, chipped around the edges, and she's carefully nudging a tiny pile of roly-polies into a perfect circle around a flat, polished stone.\n\nThere's chalk too—smudges of white forming symbols you don't recognize, looping around the edge of the rock like a secret ritual.\n\nShe hums to herself, something tuneless and haunting and kind of beautiful all at the same time.\n\nYou freeze.\n\nShe looks up without surprise.\n\nOf course she does.\n\nShe tilts her head slightly, one hand still hovering over a gently-rolling bug like she's casting a spell.\n\n\"I was wondering when you'd find me,\" she says.\n\n\"What?\" you ask.

I just made space for you to arrive.\" She finally stands, brushing off her top. \"Sometimes people need the journey before they're ready to listen.\"\n\nYou stare at her, unsure whether to be frustrated or relieved.\n\nShe brushes a bit of dirt from her fingers and adds, \"I'm glad you came.\"\n\nThe courtyard feels oddly quiet now.

Their little lives continue with no idea they'd been part of some strange, sacred ritual.\n\n\"You're not the first person to ask me for help,\" she says softly. \"And you won't be the last.\"\n\nYou wait, holding your breath.\n\n\"But I'm not the one who can give it.\"\n\nThat lands with a dull thud in your chest.\n\nShe sees the shift in your face, the drop in your shoulders, and gently adds, \"It's not because I don't want to. But this? This is yours.\"\n\nYou look at her, uncertain. \"But you know things, Aurora. You warned me. You knew something bad was coming.\"\n\n\"I did.\" She nods once. \"And I still do. But warnings aren't cures. Prophecies aren't solutions.\"\n\nYou frown. \"So what are you even here for? To be cryptic and poetic while I fall apart?\"\n\nAurora lets out a soft laugh. \"No. I'm here to remind you that you're not just falling apart. You're changing. And change always feels like breaking at first.\"\n\nYou look down for a few seconds, thinking her words over. But when you glance back, she's not watching you anymore. She's looking at the horizon, past the fencing that wraps around campus, past the cracked sidewalks and autumn trees. It's like she sees something there that hasn't happened yet.\n\nYou hesitate, then speak.\n\n\"Amber,\" you state. \"She knows about this. I want to talk to her again.\"\n\nShe tilts her head, expression unreadable. \"You're sure?\"\n\nYou nod. \"Yeah. I am.\"\n\nThere's something steady in your voice you didn't expect.\n\nAurora studies you for another long second, as if she's making sure this isn't a passing whim. Then she closes her hand into a fist. When she opens again, there's a small slip of paper. You don't see her write anything on it. She just folds it in half and presses it into your hand.\n\nYou open it.\n\nIt's not a spell. Not a riddle.\n\nJust the name of a building, scrawled in deep purple ink.\n\nThe Hollow Glen Apartments – Building C'\n\nYou blink. \"That's downtown. Near the college.\"\n\nAurora nods once.\n\n\"That's where you'll find her.\"\n\nYou look down at the note. \"So she just lives here?\"\n\nSilence.\n\nYou look up to ask more, but Aurora's already turning. She walks toward the trees, her black top swaying with the breeze and bracelets glinting faintly. The purple tips of her hair catch the sunlight streaks of twilight. She's not walking away. Just elsewhere.\n\n\"Aurora—wait—\" you call out, but when you step around the hedge to follow her—\n\nShe's gone.\n\nJust like that.\n\nYou stare at the place she'd been. The patch of dirt and the now disbanded circle of bugs. The paper in your hand with that address feels heavier than it should.\n\nIt's time to find Amber.\n\n[Choice: The Hollow Glen Apartments – Building C]",

Then shake your head. \"Not really. Not as much anymore.\"\n\n She smiles proudly. \"That's pretty damn big.\"\n\n You glance at her. \"But... things are still hard. Especially at school. The more I change, the louder people whisper.\"\n\n Her smile fades.\n\n You hesitate, then finally say it. \"I got pulled into the principal's office today. Mr. Thompson. He didn't outright accuse me of anything, but it was all there. The way he looked at me. The way he talked about 'concerns' and how I'm 'confusing people.' He said that my teachers are going to be sending him weekly updates now. They're monitoring me. Just waiting for me to mess up.\"\n\n Amber's expression hardens, the coffee mug creaking slightly under her grip. \"That's a damn power trip, [name]. Not a policy.\"\n\n \"Yeah, well, he's making it his policy. Everyone's whispering. About what I'm doing and what I'm becoming. And I get it—I look different. Hell, I am different. But it's like they're all waiting to see what side I land on.\"\n\n Amber hums. \"And you're still figuring that out yourself.\"\n\n \"Exactly.\"\n\n She watches you for a few beats before finally saying: \"You don't owe anyone an explanation for who you're becoming. Not them. Not your fuckwit of a principal. Not even me.\"\n\n You blink.\n\n \"You're not a case study,\" she says, leaning back and sipping her coffee. \"You're a person. And if this magic is helping you see more of yourself, even through the chaos? Then it doesn't sound like a curse to me. Not really.\"\n\n You glance at her, something warm stirring under your ribs.\n\n \"It doesn't feel like a curse,\" you admit. \"Not anymore.\"\n\n Amber smiles again, that proud older sister kind of smile. \"Told you. Prodigy.\"\n\n You groan again at the stupid nickname.\n\n \"You've come all this way, so... got questions?\" she asks gently, a spark of curiosity behind all that cool composure. \"Or did you drop in to vibe?\"\n\n You smirk despite yourself, and she grins back.\n\n Then she adds, more sincerely. \"Seriously.

You shift uncomfortably, hands stuffed in your pockets, eyes flicking toward the note Aurora gave you like it might change. It doesn't.\n\n You take a breath. You hate the softened lines and unfamiliar curves of your reflection. You need help.\n\n You knock.\n\n The door opens a few seconds later.\n\n Amber stands there, barefoot and casual, hair in a loose bun and wearing a faded hoodie that says WITCHES GET STUFF DONE across the chest. She's holding a mug that smells like coffee.\n\n She eyes you up and down. \"Well, look who's here.\"\n\n You step inside without a word.\n\n Her apartment is warm and lived-in. Crystals on bookshelves. A half-melted candle on the coffee table, a blanket fort in one corner, for reasons you don't even question.

Amber takes the chair across from you, curling one leg underneath herself, still nursing her coffee.\n\n \"You look like someone who's been fighting their own shadow,\" she says. \"Metaphorically, of course.\"\n\n You give her a half-shrug. \"I just want this to stop. All of it.\"\n\n Amber nods slowly. \"You and every other poor soul who stumbles into transformation magic with both fists clenched.\"\n\n \"I didn't choose this, Amber,\" you say.

'Sorry, I look like this because a crazy witch cursed me and now I'm halfway into a body I never asked for'?\"\n\n She doesn't answer right away.\n\n \"I get it,\" she finally says, voice softening. \"I really do. You're not me. You didn't ask to become something new. And it's okay to say that out loud. It's okay to be frustrated.

It's like she's heard this question a hundred times—but would never treat it like it's less than sacred.\n\n \"You know, I didn't,\" she says. \"Not at first.\"\n\n She leans forward, resting her arms on her knees. \"I knew something felt wrong, that's for sure. I'd look in the mirror and feel like I was borrowing my own skin. Everyone told me I was fine, but it always felt like I was performing fine.\"\n\n You nod, the feeling hitting too close to home.\n\n \"And one day,\" she continues. \"I stopped asking, 'What if I'm wrong?' and started asking, 'What if I'm right?'\" Her eyes soften. \"That changed everything.\"\n\n You glance down as you play with your fingers. \"Was it scary?\"\n\n Amber chuckles. \"It was fucking terrifying. But it was also real. And once I tasted that? There was no going back.\"\n\n Her words sit heavy in your chest.\n\n \"You already knew to come here,\" she adds. \"Even if you weren't sure why. That's not nothing, Prodigy.\"\n\n You don't groan this time. You just smile because maybe she's right. Maybe you've already started knowing.\n \n \n You glance at her as you fidget with your hands.\n\n \"...What if I lose people over this?\" you ask quietly. \"Friends. Family. People that matter to me.\"\n\n Amber doesn't answer right away, opting to just lean back.\n\n \"You probably will,\" she finally says.\n\n The bluntness lands hard. She's not being cruel or scaring you though. She's just being honest.\n\n \"I did,\" she continues. \"Friends I grew up with. A cousin who used to braid my hair when I was a kid. Even a couple exes who swore they'd always support me. Turns out it was easy to say that until I started making things real.\"\n\n You nod slowly.\n\n \"But here's the part I didn't get until later,\" Amber says, voice warm but firm. \"Losing them felt like grief. But it was just clarity.\"\n\n She sets the mug down, locking eyes with you. \"Anyone who bails because you're becoming more of yourself? They were never really holding on to you in the first place. Just the version of you that didn't make them uncomfortable.\"\n\n You sit with that. It stings—but not in the wrong way.\n\n Amber smiles, something sharp and proud. \"You're not going to be too much for the right people. The people who stay? They're gold. And you've already got a few of those, don't you?\"\n\n You think of the people who've stuck close to you. You nod.\n\n Amber taps the side of her mug. \"Then you're already ahead of where I was.\"\n\n Her words somehow help more than you expected them to.\n \n \n You toy with the edge of one of the throw pillows on her couch, fingers curling into the seam. The question slips out before you fully think it through.\n\n \"Do you ever miss who you used to be?\"\n\n Amber stills for a moment. Then she exhales through her nose and sits back in her chair, letting the weight of the question settle.\n\n \"Sometimes,\" she says.\n\n You glance up at her, surprised by how easily she admits it.\n\n Amber gives a small, wry smile. \"Not because I liked who I was back then. I didn't then and I don't now. But because back then, things were simple. People smiled more and they didn't ask questions. I could disappear when I wanted. There's a kind of safety in invisibility—especially when the alternative is being seen the wrong way.\"\n\n You swallow.\n\n \"It's okay to feel weird about who you used to be, [name],\" Amber says, looking at you more seriously now. \"You don't have to hate that version. You don't even have to fully understand them. Just recognize that they helped you get to the version of you that feels real.\"\n\n The words hit somewhere deep—somewhere that doesn't need to be explained right now.\n \n\n \"Thanks,\" you say softly.\n\n Amber raises her mug and grins. \"Always happy to deliver some clarity with a side of witchy aesthetic.\"\n\n \n \n You lean forward, elbows on your knees, hands clasped so tight your knuckles ache.\n\n And you don't bother dancing around it.\n\n \"Amber... how do I make it stop?\"\n\n Your voice cracks just slightly. Not from fear, exactly, but from exhaustion. The weight of knowing you're on a clock, and the deadline's coming fast.\n\n Amber's face shapes with a quiet sympathy she usually keeps hidden behind swagger.\n\n She doesn't answer right away so you press on.\n\n \"I know I've got until graduation. Until the end of senior year. After that, it's permanent. The curse locks in. The changes stay.\"\n\n She sighs, setting her mug aside. \"I wish I could tell you the answer, Prodigy. I really do.\"\n\n Your stomach sinks.\n\n \"But the truth is nobody knows how to break what Serena sets in motion,\" she continues. \"She's not just powerful—she's old magic. Deep magic. The kind of spellwork that wraps itself around your soul. Once it's started... stopping it outright?\" Amber shakes her head. \"That's above what most witches can even dream of. Probably even Serena herself.\"\n\n You look away, jaw tight. \"So what, I'm just screwed?\"\n\n \"No,\" Amber says firmly. \"You're not.\"\n\n You glance back at her.\n\n \"We'll figure it out,\" she says. \"I'll help and we'll figure something out. I'm not gonna let you walk into the end of senior year and get rewritten by a curse you didn't ask for.\"\n\n Your chest tightens again—but this time, it's in relief, not in panic.\n\n \"You're not alone in this,\" Amber says, reaching out to hold your hand in hers.\n\n And you believe her.\n \n \n You stare down at the floor for a long while before the words finally come.\n\n \"Did you ever feel like you were... becoming something else?\" you ask. \"Something that didn't feel like you at all?\"\n\n Amber doesn't answer right away. She sets her coffee down and leans forward in her chair. The smile she wears now isn't playful or smug. It's thoughtful.\n\n \"No,\" she says softly. \"But that's because I wanted the change. For me, it wasn't becoming something else. It was finally becoming myself.\"\n\n She looks at you carefully.\n\n \"But I get the question. And I get why you're asking it.\"\n\n You glance up at her.\n\n Amber continues, voice steady. \"If you're standing in front of a mirror and watching your body shift into something that doesn't feel right—something you never asked for—that's not transition. That's disorientation. That's your sense of self getting scrambled by something bigger than you.\"\n\n She shakes her head. \"And no one should be forced to feel that way.\"\n\n You feel your chest tighten.\n\n \"I've worked with people who got hit with identity-affecting magic before,\" she says. \"Not all of them were trans. Some of them just... didn't know how to process what was happening to them. And the worst thing anyone can do in that moment is pretend it's not a violation.\"\n\n You nod slowly. \"That's what it feels like.\"\n\n Amber folds her hands in her lap. \"Then you've got every right to push back and to fight for yourself. You don't have to become anyone else, [name]. Not unless that's something you want. Your identity's not broken. It's under siege.\"\n\n There's no judgement in her eyes, just clarity.\n\n You nod again, this time far more certain.\n\n Amber's not questioning who you are, she's helping you defend it.\n \n \n You stare at the bookshelf behind Amber for a long moment, eyes unfocused, tracking the spines of old spellbooks and journals.\n\n Then you say it,\n\n \"Why me?\"\n\n Amber looks up from her coffee.\n\n \"Why did Madame Serena have to pick me? I didn't do anything. I just did the wrong thing in a stupid tent and suddenly I'm cursed like I signed up for it or something.\"\n\n There's heat in your voice now. Not rage. Just tired of trying to understand something that never made sense.\n\n Amber's gaze narrows slightly—not at you, but like she's thinking through something complicated.\n\n \"Honestly?\" she says after a moment. \"No one really knows what goes through Madame Serena's head. She's powerful and old as hell—probably sees the world in layers most of us don't even know exist.\"\n\n You already expected that.\n\n \"But..\" Amber sets her mug down and folds her hands. \"If I had to guess? She looked at you, saw someone she thought was trans—and assumed this was some big cosmic awakening just waiting to happen. Like she was judging you toward your so-called 'truth.'\"\n\n You stare at her.\n\n \"She was wrong,\" Amber says firmly. \"And that matters.\"\n\n You feel your throat tighten. \"So I got cursed because someone misread me and I just have to ride it out?\"\n\n Amber's eyes are steady. \"No. Now you fight for your own reflection. You don't owe this curse a transformation just because someone expected it of you.\"\n\n She lets that land before speaking up again, softer this time. \"You're not broken for not becoming what she thought you would. You're you. And that's not a failure, [name].\"\n\n For the first time, someone said it out loud: Serena was wrong. And you're not here to fulfill a story that isn't yours.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Just the soft clink of wooden blocks, the creak of the couch, and the low murmur of some hip-hop playlist humming from her phone. There's something calming about it—about doing something so pointless on purpose.\n\nAbout being allowed to laugh when you manage to pull out a block and Amber mutters, \"Rude,\" like it personally betrayed her.\n\nAbout the way she grins when she pulls the whispering block and holds it to her ear, theatrically gasping. \"It says you're gonna lose. That's fucking brutal.\"\n\nAbout how you smile—genuinely, finally—and don't even realize it until it's already happened.\n\nThe tower starts to sway.\n\nAmber leans in. \"Do you feel that, [name]?\"\n\n\"The tension?\" you ask, squinting.\n\n\"No. The fear.

Your armpits, too—when you lift an arm to brush wet strands of hair from your face, you catch the faint shadow of stubble returning. Even down below, you can feel it. Your pubic hair is growing like it never left.\n\n You sigh, sinking deeper into the water until your chin touches the surface.\n\n You shaved a little over a week ago and you remember how your skin felt after: smooth, clean, quiet. But now it's all creeping back in. It's subtle, sure, but it feels loud.\n\n You run your fingers over your skin, the short hair prickling under your touch. It doesn't feel neutral. It feels off. Not in a dramatic way, but like it doesn't match.\n\n You let your head fall back against the tub wall, staring at the ceiling as the steam rises around you.\n\n Should I shave again?\n\n Maybe you already know the answer.\n \n \n You shift slightly in the tub, letting the warm water lap higher up your chest as the last of the steam curls lazily along the walls. The heat has done its job—your muscles ache less and your brain's stopped spinning.\n\n Then your eyes drift down.\n\n Your legs break the surface as you stretch them, and that's when you notice the hair. Just a little, but enough to catch the light. Your leg hair's grown back, faint but visible. You lift your arm to wipe at your brow, and sure enough—your armpit hair's creeping back in as well. Not as thick as it used to be, but not gone.\n\n Lower down, you can feel your pubic hair, trying to reclaim space.\n\n You sigh and sink a little deeper into the water, staring at the ceiling.\n\n You shaved just a little over a week ago. The first time you did anything that made you pause and wonder if you'd crossed some kind of line. You told yourself it was just about comfort, or curiosity, or maybe even defiance—like you were trying to remind the [referto] that you were still in control.\n\n But now? You're not sure where that line is anymore.\n\n You tilt your head against the edge of the tub, water sloshing gently around your shoulders. You didn't hate the feeling of being smooth. It was weird, sure, but you didn't hate it.\n\n And now you're wondering if you should do it again.\n \n\n \n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You ease deeper into the bath, the heat soaking into your skin. The steam fogs up the mirror, softening everything into a blur.\n\n It's quiet here in a way the rest of the world hasn't felt since the [referto].\n\n Your gaze drifts downward as you stretch your legs beneath the water, watching the ripples catch the soft glow of the bathroom light. Your skin glistens, warm and flushed from the heat—and covered in body hair. Your legs, your armpits, even down below—all of it unchanged. All of it still there.\n\n It catches you off guard. You've changed so much, but this? This part hasn't moved at all. The hair still grows like it always did. Rough and thick.\n\n You swallow hard and run your fingers along your skin, watching the strands shift under your touch. You hadn't really noticed until now. You'd been so focused on what had changed, that you didn't realize how much the parts that didn't feel like anchors dragging you backward.\n\n And you wonder: Why haven't I shaved yet?\n\n Back when you had the chance, you didn't. You weren't ready. Maybe you were afraid.\n\n But now?\n\n Now the question feels different. You're left wondering: Would it help me feel more like myself?\n\n You trail your fingers along your calf again, thoughtful.\n\n You're just deciding when you're ready, and maybe you are.\n \n \n You sink deeper into the water, letting the warmth wrap around your limbs. The steam curls gently up the tiled walls, softening the room, the world, and even the edges of your thoughts. For a moment, it's almost enough to forget just how strange everything feels.\n\n Almost.\n\n Your eyes drift down, skimming over your arms and your chest, then your legs beneath the water—where the ripples catch the dark patches of body hair that haven't changed at all. Your armpits too, when you shift slightly. It's still just as thick as before. Same goes for everything below the waist—your pubic hair, untouched by the rest of the curse.\n\n You stare at it for a second, unmoving.\n\n It's jarring, in a weird way. It doesn't quite fit with how the rest of you is reshaping. Like the static in an otherwise blurry image.\n\n You remember the choice you had a little over a week ago—to shave. You didn't. It felt like a line then. A point of resistance. One small way to say \"I'm not giving in.\"\n\n But now, you're left wondering if you should.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Shave your body]\n[Choice: Don't shave your body]",

      "text": "You slowly lower your phone as your eyes drift toward the garage door.\n\n There's a memory tickling the back of your brain. Something chaotic. Something with wheels.\n\n You shove your chair and head downstairs, pulling open the garage door—and there it is. Rusted, slightly squeaky, missing one wheel that kind of drags.\n\n The Shopping Cart.\n\n It's not just any shopping cart. It's your shopping cart. Well... not legally. But spiritually? Emotionally? That baby is as close to family as it gets.\n\n You and Lily \"liberated\" it from Walmart last summer in what she referred to as \"an emergency tactical extraction.\" The emergency? You had dared her to ride it down the sidewalk like she was in a racing game.\n\n Naturally, she accepted without hesitation. She launched off the curb immediately, traveling at supersonic speed. A Walmart employee saw her halfway through the dramatic U-turn near the cart return and shouted, \"Hey! You can't take that!\"\n\n Without missing a beat, Lily turned to him and yelled, \"I answer to no one!\" then bolted down the parking lot as the wheels rattled like thunder.\n\n You chased after her, doubled over with laughter and short on breath, trying to reason with her mid-sprint. \"Lily, this is literally a felony!\" you wheezed.\n\n She glanced back with zero remorse and shouted, \"Well, so is your haircut, [name]!\"\n\n You ended up sprinting three blocks with her driving the shopping cart the entire way home. You kept expecting the cops to show up at your house. They didn't. Probably because they were afraid of Lily as well.\n\n After that, the cart just sort of... stayed.\n\n It's been in the garage ever since, used to hold sports equipment, groceries, and one time a raccoon. Now? It's your bag.\n\n You clear out the junk and test it out, stuffing your notebooks inside with a weird sense of satisfaction. They fit way too well. You push the cart forward—it squeaks like the ghost of every bad decision you've ever made, sure, but it rolls.\n\n You take a deep breath, step back, and admire your handiwork. You, [name], are about to stroll into school pushing a stolen shopping cart filled with school supplies.\n\n This is going to be unhinged.\n\n \n You stare at your phone for a few seconds, then slowly turn your head toward the corner of your room where The Tank sits. Empty. Dusty. Slightly haunted.\n\n A beat passes.\n\n You mutter, \"No way.\"\n\n But now you can't stop thinking about it.\n\n The fish tank.\n\n The tank that you and Lily once filled with hope, aquatic gravel, and the doomed soul of a fish named Dr. Pickles.\n\n It had started off normal—Lily had stomped into your room one summer afternoon, holding a plastic bag from the pet store like it was filled with sacred treasure. \"This is our child now,\" she declared. Inside was a cheap little betta fish that looked perpetually angry. \n \n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You tried to name it something like \"Bubbles\" or \"Crystal\", but \n \n \n You tried to name it something like \"Turbo\" or \"Spike\", but \n \n \n Lily insisted on Dr. Pickles, because \"he looks like he has a PhD in anger and disappointment. Just like you.\"\n\n You both spent an entire day decorating the tank—colored gravel, fake plants, a castle with a hole in it that Dr. Pickles never used. Lily said it gave him \"emotional depth.\" You said it gave him a hiding spot from her yelling. She called you a \"brain-dead clownfish\" and threw a gummy worm at you.\n\n Dr. Pickles lasted a whopping four days.\n\n Cause of death? Unknown. Could've been stress. Could've been overfeeding. Could've been the time Lily tried to play him \"lo-fi study beats\" and he went totally still for two hours.\n\n You held a funeral in the backyard. Lily wore black. You said a few words about how he lived fast and died confusingly. Lily flushed him instead because she said he \"deserved to return to the sea.\" Then you both vowed to never speak of it again.\n\n Until now.\n\n Now, years after Dr. Pickle's tragic demise, you find yourself dragging the dusty fish tank out of your closet. You blow off a layer of dust and wonder if the water stain inside is actually shaped like a skull or if your eyes are playing tricks on you.\n\n You give it a quick clean, toss your notebooks and laptop inside, and stand back to admire your handiwork.\n\n A fish tank. A literal glass box of former dreams. Now a school bag.\n\n If this isn't peak Homecoming Week energy, what is?\n\n \n You stare at your phone for a few more seconds before tossing your phone aside your legs off the bed. \"Bring anything but a backpack,\" huh? You think for a few moments. You want something weird. Something bold. Something—\n\n Your eyes widen as a memory hits you: The Halloween Cauldron.\n\n Last year, you and Lily used the cauldron to hand out candy—though, technically, she demanded you assist her \"as her cursed minion\" and you were too lazy to argue. She had wanted to go full witch—pointy hat, fake warts, green face paints—but you'd \"accidentally\" lost the hat in the dryer two days before Halloween. So she settled for a vampire cape and spent the entire night calling you a \"disgrace to Halloween fashion.\"\n\n You wore those cheap plastic devil horns you found in the glove compartment and told people you were \"emotionally cursed.\" Lily took one look at you, scoffed, and said, \"You didn't need the horns for that, loser.\" Then she told every trick-or-treater you were her \"hunchbacked goblin assistant\" and made you cackle dramatically every time she dropped candy in their buckets. You did it once. She said it was pathetic.\n\n After the last group of kids left, you dumped all the leftover candy into the cauldron, and Lily insisted on eating five mini Snickers \"for potion-testing purposes.\" Then you both chucked the cauldron into the garage with the rest of the holiday chaos.\n\n You haven't seen it since.\n\n But it's perfect.\n\n You spring to your feet and head to the hallway. You slip down the stairs quietly and make your way to the garage, heart beating with a strange mix of mischief and curiosity.\n\n The garage is cold and dim, smelling like oil, cardboard, and forgotten seasons. You shove aside a beach chair, duck under a string of tangled Christmas lights, and spot it: a battered black plastic cauldron, wedged between an old rake and a dusty bin of Easter stuff.\n\n You tug it out, brushing off a few stubborn cobwebs. The faded orange label still reads Witch's Brew in Lily's aggressively sharp handwriting, with a tiny doodle of a broom crashing into a tree. You pop the lid open and grin—inside, there's a lone stale peppermint, a broken glow stick, and one plastic spider clinging to the side like it's guarding ancient secrets.\n\n It's perfect. Loud. Stupid. Borderline magical.\n\n You carry it back into your room, swing it onto your bed, and start cramming materials inside. You barely manage to get your laptop in there, although you make sure to cushion it with notebooks. It barely fits, but it works.\n\n When you glance at your reflection, you laugh. The plastic cauldron dangling from your hand makes it look like you're off to Advanced Potions.\n\n This is either genius or social suicide.\n\n You grab your water bottle and head toward the front door, the cauldron swinging at your side with a soft clunk-clunk.\n\n Whatever happens today... you're most definitely making an entrance.\n\n \n You stare at your phone. It still reads Bring Anything But a Backpack Day like it's some grand call to adventure.\n\n And what do you do?\n\n You reach for your regular, two-shoulder, zipper-having, painfully black backpack like some kind of functioning adult.\n\n Wow.\n\n The spirit of Homecoming truly burns bright within you.\n\n You zip it up with a sigh, not even pretending to look for a fish tank, a stolen shopping cart, or a haunted Halloween cauldron. You just sling the plain old thing over your shoulder.\n\n No statement. No chaos. No joy. Just straps.\n\n At least no one will stare at you. After all, why would they? You're just... normal.\n\n How thrilling.\n \n\n \n[Choice: Choose your clothes]\n[Choice: Just wear something]\n[Choice: Outfit Preset #1]\n[Choice: Outfit Preset #2]\n[Choice: Outfit Preset #3]",

Tired of waiting for him to catch up. Tired of standing still while everyone else decides how confused they are.\n\n So you say it.\n\n \"I'm changing,\" you tell him, your voice not wavering. \"And you haven't been here to see it.\"\n\n The silence that follows is immediate and heavy.\n\n Your dad's mouth opens, then closes again. It's like he had a response ready but lost it while hearing your voice. His grip tightens on the folder he's holding, like it's the only thing keeping his hands from shaking.\n\n \"I didn't...\" he starts, voice low. \"I didn't realize it was that serious.\"\n\n \"You didn't realize anything, because you weren't here.\"\n\n It's not cruel. it's just true.\n \n You can see it land—the guilt, the surprise, the way he suddenly looks ten years older.\n\n \"I've been trying to keep up,\" he says, almost to himself. \"Work's just—\"\n\n \"I know,\" you cut in. \"It's always work.\"\n\n He looks at you again, really looks—and this time, the silence is different. Not from shock, but from regret.\n\n You step past him slowly, walking toward your room without waiting for an answer. For once, you feel like you said enough.\n\n But once you reach your door, you can't help but glance back.\n\n He's still standing there. Still holding the folder like he's forgotten what it was even for.\n\n And he watches as you disappear inside, the door closing softly behind you.\n\n This time, you don't look back.\n\n \n You cross your arms instinctively and shift your weight under your dad's confused stare. He's still holding that folder like it might shield him from the conversation to come, like it'll somehow make this version of you easier to explain.\n\n You meet his eyes.\n \n \"It's complicated,\" you say. \"I don't really wanna talk about it right now.\"\n\n His brow furrows, and for a second, he looks like he might press—like he's about to ask what exact is complicated and why you look different. But something in your tone stops him.\n\n He exhales, rubbing the back of his neck. \"Okay,\" he says. Not understanding and certainly not satisfied, but not pushing either. \"Okay.\"\n\n You nod once and step past him, slow and calm, heart thudding just a little too loud in your chest. You can feel his eyes on your back, the weight of unspoken words hanging in the hallway.\n\n But he doesn't call after you and you don't offer more.\n\n When you reach your room, you pause at the door, your fingers on the handle. You can't help but glance back.\n\n He's still standing there, folder in hand, deep in thought.\n\n You turn the knob, step inside, and close the door with a soft click.\n\n Some things can wait. Tonight, you don't owe anyone answers.\n\n \n You shift where you're standing. This all feels too damn sudden. Your dad still looks like he's trying to put a puzzle together with half the pieces missing.\n\n You take a breath.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, voice soft but steady. \"Some stuff's been happening. I'm still figuring it out. It's weird. I know I look different.\"\n\n His eyes flick over you again.\n\n \"I'm not doing this to freak anyone out,\" you say, more to break the silence than to defend yourself. \"I didn't plan for any of it. But it's happening. And I'm dealing with it the best I can.\"\n\n Your dad is quiet. His hand tightens on the folder he's holding.\n\n Finally, after what feels like a million years, he says, \"Okay.\"\n\n Just that. No understanding or approval.\n\n \"Well, I'm going to go lie down,\" you say after a beat, already turning toward your room.\n\n \"Alright,\" he replies voice low.\n\n You walk slowly, the soft creak of the floor the only sound until you reach your door. You glance back just once—he's still standing there, watching, unsure of his place in your new life.\n\n But he doesn't look away.\n\n And neither do you.\n\n Then you open your door, step inside, and close it gently behind you.\n\n \n You don't answer right away.\n\n Your dad's question hangs in the air like it expects to be answered immediately, like it has earned a response just by being spoken.\n\n But it hasn't. Not really. Not to you.\n\n You look him in the eye and say, flatly:\n\n \"You said you'd be around more, Dad.\"\n\n That lands. Sharp and sudden.\n\n He blinks, caught off guard, like you hit him in a spot he didn't realize was exposed. \"I—yeah. I did.\"\n\n You nod once. \"And then you weren't.\"\n\n He opens his mouth like he's going to explain it away. Like work is a shield he can still hide behind after all these years. But the words don't come.\n\n So you stand there.\n\n Your dad looks at you and you don't look away.\n\n For a long moment, neither of you speaks. His mouth opens slightly as he shifts, like he wants to say something—an apology, maybe, or another excuse he's not sure you'll expect.\n\n But whatever it is, it doesn't come out.\n\n You're not even angry anymore. Just tired. Tired of having to catch him up to a life he was supposed to be part of Tired of the silence. Tired of him not even knowing how much you've been changing.\n\n You nod then brush past him gently, walking down the hallway to your room without another word.\n\n He stays there, folder still in hand, watching as you disappear into your room and close the door behind you with a click.\n\n He doesn't follow and you don't wait for him to.\n \n\n[Choice: End of a long day]",

That's when you spot Luke waiting at the curb.\n\n He turns.\n\n He sees the cart.\n\n And he just stares.\n\n \"Is that... is that Maverick?\" he asks, voice caught somewhere between shock and absolute delight.\n\n \"I almost forgot we named the thing,\" you respond.\n\n \"Dude, everyone in your neighborhood remembers his name, what are you talking about? Your mom used to push groceries in it when your car broke down. I saw your sister ride in that thing to piano lessons like it was a royal carriage. I thought you guys... just adopted it.\"\n\n \"Well, we kinda did,\" you admit, giving the handle a small, squeaky shake. \"Lily says it's legally ours under 'weird suburban street law.'\"\n\n He walks around the cart, inspecting it like a rare animal exhibit. \"You stole this from Walmart, didn't you?\"\n\n \"I prefer the term 'liberated,'\" you say. \"It was an act of civil disobedience and poor judgment.\"\n\n \"I remember seeing it in your garage like... constantly. I thought it was part of your furniture.\"\n\n \"It's multifunctional. We've used it for groceries, storage, and a defensive barrier.\"\n\n Luke whistles. \"And now it's a backpack.\"\n\n You nod solemnly in response. \"It's entered its academic arc.\"\n \n \"You wanna see what I brought?\" Luke says, grinning. It's clear he's just itching to show you.\n\n \"What is it?\" you ask, a hint of exasperation in your voice. You can already tell it's going to be something stupid.\n\n With a flourish, Luke pulls out a fucking leaf blower.\n\n An actual, slightly busted, battery-operated leaf blower. The front chute is neatly plugged with a foam cap—probably from an old Nerf football. Your brain short-circuits trying to understand the logistics until he lifts it slightly, revealing that he's hollowed out the intake chamber and stuffed his notebooks, calculator, and what looks like a pencil pouch wedged in. The inside is reinforced with duct tape and lined with bubble wrap.\n\n \"Luke,\" you say slowly, \"why?\"\n\n \"Because what's more powerful than knowledge?\" He taps the side of the machine. \"Applied knowledge. This bad boy's blowing away ignorance and raising Pacific Crest's average GPA by at least, like, 0.2.\"\n\n \"God knows we need it,\" you respond.\n\n You both stand there for a beat, two complete disasters holding a shopping cart and a decommissioned leaf blower like you're preparing for the world's weirdest heist.\n\n Luke pats the cart gently. \"If this thing rolls downhill, I'm not chasing you. Just saying.\"\n\n \"If this thing rolls downhill, I'm going with it.\"\n\n He grins. \"Ride or die, right?\"\n\n You shake your head, starting to push Maverick down the sidewalk. The cart lets out a metallic screeee with every rotation, echoing your dignity as it slowly rolls into oblivion.\n\n And together, you and Luke make your way toward school, with no regard for what backpacks were ever supposed to be.\n\n \n You adjust your grip on the fish tank for the fifth time as you finally step out the front door, the cold glass pressing awkwardly into your forearm. It's heavier than you thought. Or maybe it's just the emotional weight of carrying your dead dreams in a makeshift aquarium.\n\n The morning air is crisp, and the fish tank glints under the soft sunlight, its freshly cleaned walls reflecting just enough to catch the eye. Your school supplies clink gently inside—notebooks, pencils, crumpled worksheets, one stray sticky note that reads \"Dr. Pickles, RIP\" in Lily's handwriting.\n\n You make it halfway down the front walk when you spot him.\n\n Luke.\n\n He's waiting for you at the curb like he always does, bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet, hoodie half-zipped, hair tousled like he ran through a wind tunnel. He turns the second he hears your footsteps.\n\n Then he sees what you're carrying.\n\n He blinks. Once. Twice.\n\n And then he bursts into laughter.\n\n \"Dude. No way.\" He jogs up to you, practically glowing with excitement. \"Is that your backpack? A fish tank? Like an actual—\" he leans in, peering through the glass like he expects a live goldfish to be swimming past your math homework, \"—dude, you committed. I love it.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Well, I just figured if I'm going to embarrass myself, I might as well go all in.\"\n\n Luke grins. \"You say 'embarrass,' I say 'iconic.' Honestly, this gives off some mysterious energy. Like, 'Behold, I carry the knowledge of the deep in this cursed vessel.'\"\n\n You snort. \"It carries calculus.\"\n\n \"Same thing,\" Luke says, waving it off. \"They both have, like... numbers and stress and stuff.\"\n\n He pauses. \"I mean, I don't take calculus. I'm in that other one that has the letter that shouldn't be there. Like, why is 'x' always lost? Maybe he doesn't want to be found.\"\n\n You snort, but he keeps going, totally serious.\n\n \"I'm in Algebra 1 right now. Took a little detour getting here. Freshman year I failed a quiz so bad the Scantron machine just gave up. Like, it literally stopped grading.\"\n\n \"That's not possible.\"\n\n \"I'm just saying some people are gifted in other areas,\" he says. \"Like I'm built for athletics, not equations.\"\n\n You don't even know how to respond.\n \n Then you realize Luke's holding something too—carrying something, actually—and you do a double take.\n\n \"Wait, Luke, what the hell is that?\"\n\n He beams. \"Oh! Right!\" He turns slightly to show you, as if he's been waiting for the big reveal.\n\n It's a fucking leaf blower.\n\n An actual, slightly busted, battery-operated leaf blower. The front chute is neatly plugged with a foam cap—probably from an old Nerf football. Your brain short-circuits trying to understand the logistics until he lifts it slightly, revealing that he's hollowed out the intake chamber and stuffed his notebooks, calculator, and what looks like a pencil pouch wedged in. The inside is reinforced with duct tape and lined with bubble wrap.\n\n \"Luke,\" you say slowly, \"why?\"\n\n \"Because what's more powerful than knowledge?\" He taps the side of the machine. \"Applied knowledge. This bad boy's blowing away ignorance and raising Pacific Crest's average GPA by at least, like, 0.2.\"\n\n \"God knows we need it,\" you respond.\n\n You both stand there for a beat, two complete disasters holding a fish tank and a decommissioned leaf blower like you're preparing for the world's weirdest heist.\n\n Luke looks at you, suddenly thoughtful. \"[name], do you think Dr. Pickles would be proud of you?\"\n\n You choke. \"Oh my God.\"\n\n \"He totally would, man. He'd look at you through those little judgmental; fish eyes and be like, 'You're finally using my death for something beautiful.'\" He holds up a fist. \"For the fallen.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but bump fists with him anyway.\n\n It's ridiculous. All of it. But somehow, standing there with your best friends, backpacks replaced by garbage and nostalgia, you feel alright.\n\n \n You step outside with your cauldron swinging at your side, the plastic handle creaking ominously under the weight of your books. It thunks against your hip with every step, making you sound like some kind of medieval peddler trudging to the market with a sack full of curses and overdue assignments.\n\n The morning air is brisk, but the vibe is absolutely unhinged.\n\n You're halfway down the driveway when you see him.\n\n Luke's standing on the curb waiting like always. He's pacing a little but when he spots you, his face lights up.\n\n Then he sees the cauldron.\n\n He freezes. \"Dude,\" he says. \"Is that a witch's cauldron?\"\n\n You hold it up with a flat expression. \"This is my backpack now. I've evolved.\"\n\n He stares at it with something between awe and delight. \"This is incredible. You look like you're gonna turn in your math homework and also summon a demon.\"\n\n \"I mean, that basically is calculus,\" you say. \"Ms. Tanaka says 'integration by parts' but I swear she's whispering dark Latin under her breath.\"\n\n Luke starts pacing slowly around you like a crow sizing up a shiny soda can. \"It's so... round. And ominous. And it makes this little bonk sound when you walk, have you noticed that? Like an evil kettle of doom.\"\n\n \"If anything in here's cursed, it's the graphing calculator,\" you say, sighing.\n\n \"Wait a second...\" Luke says, squinting at the cauldron like he's seeing it for the first time. \"Is this the same one from Halloween?\"\n\n \"Oh God,\" you say, groaning.\n\n \"It is! It says Witch's Brew right there. This is Lily's cauldron!\" he cackles. \"The one she made you carry around like her goth assistant of doom!\"\n\n \"She was handing out candy and yelling at third graders,\" you mutter. \"Someone had to refill the Snickers supply.\"\n\n \"She called you 'my goblin boy' all night,\" Luke gasps, already losing it. \"You went along with it too! You kept saying 'yes, my liege' like a cursed butler.\"\n\n \"She threatened me with blackmail if I didn't commit to the bit.\"\n\n \"[name], you were the bit.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, adjusting the handle as the cauldron shifts and lets out another hollow thunk. \"How about you stop judging me and show me what you brought.\"\n\n Luke shifts to the side with a hoists up his so-called \"backpack\"—and it's a fucking leaf blower.\n\n An actual, slightly busted, battery-operated leaf blower. The front chute is neatly plugged with a foam cap—probably from an old Nerf football. Your brain short-circuits trying to understand the logistics until he lifts it slightly, revealing that he's hollowed out the intake chamber and stuffed his notebooks, calculator, and what looks like a pencil pouch wedged in. The inside is reinforced with duct tape and lined with bubble wrap.\n\n \"Luke,\" you say slowly, \"why?\"\n\n \"Because what's more powerful than knowledge?\" He taps the side of the machine. \"Applied knowledge.

I feel like it's cursed. What if it starts bubbling mid-lecture and I get turned into a frog?\"\n\n You sigh. \"You wouldn't last ten minutes as a frog.\"\n\n \"I'd thrive as a frog,\" he fires back, fully confident in his amphibian abilities.\n\n You shake your head, trying not to laugh as you both start walking, the cauldron thumping softly against your leg and Luke's leaf blower squeaking with every third step.\n\n \n \n You step out the front door with your everyday backpack slung over your shoulder. It's black. It has zippers. It holds things. That's... pretty much it.\n\n The morning is bright. The air is buzzing with Homecoming Week energy. And you?\n\n You look like you're on your way to take the SAT early.\n\n You make it halfway down the driveway before you see Luke waiting at the curb—already grinning like he knows he's about to roast you.\n\n He spots the backpack.\n\n The grin widens.\n\n \"No way,\" he says, as if you've personally offended the spirit of Homecoming Week. \"[name], we had one chance to be absolute menaces, and you show up like you're doing an ad for back-to-school season.\"\n\n You roll your eyes. \"I just didn't feel like dragging a shopping cart down the street or cramming my stuff into, I don't know, a mop bucket or something.\"\n\n Luke gasps like you've insulted him and his ancestors. \"Wow. You think that little of me?\"\n\n You squint at him. \"Wait... what did you bring?\"\n\n Without a word, he reaches behind his back and hoists up a fucking leaf blower.\n\n An actual, slightly busted, battery-operated leaf blower. The front chute is neatly plugged with a foam cap—probably from an old Nerf football. Your brain short-circuits trying to understand the logistics until he lifts it slightly, revealing that he's hollowed out the intake chamber and stuffed his notebooks, calculator, and what looks like a pencil pouch wedged in. The inside is reinforced with duct tape and lined with bubble wrap.\n\n Your mouth opens. \"You didn't.\"\n\n \"Oh, I did.\" He holds it aloft like it's Excalibur. \"This is innovation. This is legacy. You? You're boring.\"\n\n You blink.\n\n \"This is why I'm gonna be a legend,\" he says, slinging the blower over his shoulder like a weapon of mass confusion. \"And you? You'll be remembered as 'that guy who brought a backpack during Bring Anything But a Backpack Day.' Tragic.\"\n\n You shake your head, adjusting the straps on your bag. \"At least I won't have to lug around landscaping equipment all day.\"\n\n Luke's already walking ahead, leaf blower bouncing against his back, leaving behind a faint trail of chaos.\n\n You sigh as you fall into step beside him. Of course Luke would bring a power tool.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "The second you and Luke set foot on campus, it's clear that Pacific Crest High School has lost its damn mind.\n\nStudents are scattered around like a chaotic fashion show of poor decisions. Someone's hauling their books in a microwave, duct-taped shut and rolling on a skateboard. A freshman waddles past with a giant teddy bear zipped open down the back. One guy's dragging a sled behind him across dry concrete, and it screeches with every step like it's screaming for help.\n\nTwo juniors pass you balancing their stuff in matching laundry baskets, walking in perfect sync like Olympic teammates. One girl near the front steps has crammed her supplies into a plastic baby bathtub, which she's cradling.\n\nAnd then there's that.\n\nDead center of the courtyard, surrounded by a growing circle of students filming with their phones, is a kid—you think his name is Mason?—pulling his books in a full-sized barbecue smoker mounted on tiny wheels.\n\nNot one of those portable tailgate grills, either. No. That would be boring. This is a massive, blackened, double-door beast of a smoker with visible scorch marks. There's a little chimney on top puffing out what you hope is just water vapor.\n\nHe's wearing welding gloves and using actual metal tongs to take out his binder, like he's preparing a brisket. Instead of meat though, it's AP Government notes.\n\nThe entire courtyard has gathered around like it's a halftime show. Someone's chanting \"MVP! MVP!\" and a nearby girl mutters, \"This is like, performance art.\"\n\nOne kid whispers, \"Did he bring this thing on the bus?\" and another answers, dead serious, \"Bro, he is the bus now.\"\n\nYou don't know whether to be impressed, terrified, or both.\n\nProbably both.\n\nLuke slows to a stop next to you, jaw slack as he takes in the chaos of the barbecue smoker and the crowd worshipping it like it's the Second Coming.\n\nHe blinks. Once. Twice.\n\nThen he exhales through his nose like he just lost the Super Bowl.\n\n\"...Damn,\" he mutters. \"I should've brought a kayak or something.\"\n\nYou glance over. \"Regretting the leaf blower?\"\n\nHe doesn't look away from the smoker. \"I really do. I thought I was doing something bold. Something different. But look at that guy. I can't even compare.\"\n\nThe crowd erupts into cheers as Mason dramatically flips open the top hatch and pulls out a laminated essay with barbecue tongs. Luke winces like he's just been outshined on national television.\n\n\"I didn't know we were allowed to go feral with it,\" he says, voice full of quiet disappointment.\n\n\"Maybe next semester, man,\" you reassure, patting his shoulder.\n\nHe nods slowly. \"Next semester... I'll bring a Jet Ski.\"\n\nAfter a few moments, Luke recovers. \"Alright, I gotta hit my locker,\" he says, grinning like nothing happened. \"Coach says if I'm late to first period again, I'll be running laps with a desk on my back.\"\n\n\"Good luck then,\" you reply, still entranced by the smoker.\n\nWith a mock salute and one last squeak from the leaf blower, Luke peels off toward the school entrance, weaving between a kid hauling his books in a traffic cone and another who's just juggling his notebooks with no bag at all. \n\nYou take a deep breath and start heading toward your own class.\n\nBut you don't make it far.\n\n\"[name].\"\n\nThe voice stops you cold—not loud, but clear. Soft, steady, like it already knows you'll listen. You turn.\n\nAurora.\n\nShe's standing near the edge of the courtyard, half in shadow under one of the big cypress trees. Her arms are crossed. Her expression is unreadable. Hair dark and curling around her shoulders, tips still dyed that deep violet that makes her look like she stepped out of a dream.\n\nYou walk over. You don't need to ask why she called you over. Not really.\n\nShe studies you in silence for a moment, then slowly raises one finger—not accusing, not deliberate. Measured.\n\n<<if [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n \"Do you feel it yet?\" she asks, voice calm and low, but there's a flicker of something behind it. Not quite concern. Something sharper.\n\n You shift your weight. \"Feel what?\"\n\n She doesn't blink. \"The shift. The consequences creeping in.\"\n\n You frown. \"Is this about the [referto]? You don't have to keep doing this riddle thing, you know.\"\n\n \"I know,\" she says softly. \"But it's more fun this way.\"\n\n You sigh.\n\n Aurora steps a little closer. \"You've made choices. Some good, some... desperate. Some you thought you could bury.\" Her eyes narrow. \"There are whispers, [name]. Not the magical kind—the high school kind.\"\n\n \"The high school kind?\" you ask. \"Do you mean the rumors? That's fine. I'll just ignore it and—\"\n\n \"No,\" she cuts in. \"You won't. You think this ends with whispers? The office is already watching you. Teachers are confused. The principal asked me about you this morning.\"\n\n Your mouth goes dry. \"Wait—what?\"\n\n \"People are noticing, [name],\" Aurora says. She steps back, ignoring your question. \"And they're starting to talk louder. You can't disappear into the background anymore.\"\n\n The bell rings.\n\n Aurora looks at you once more, eyes dark and unreadable beneath the soft light slanting through the trees. Without a word, she turns and slips back into the courtyard crowd—vanishing between students and shadows so smoothly you almost wonder if she was ever there at all.\n\n But her words stay rooted, echoing beneath your ribs like something carved instead of spoken.\n\n And the school day hasn't even started yet.\n\n [Choice: Get to class]\n\n \n \"You still look the same,\" she says, tilting her head slightly.\n\n You blink. \"...Yeah? And?\"\n\n She doesn't answer at first. Just steps around you, slow and measured, like she's observing something you can't see—some invisible field around you that's too quiet.\n\n \"This far in and barely anything's shifted,\" she murmurs, mostly to herself.\n\n \"So what?\" you ask, crossing your arms. \"That's good, isn't it?\"\n\n She looks at you—finally, really looks—and there's a stranger kind of gravity in her voice.\n\n \"No it's not.\"\n\n That lands harder than you expect.\n\n She just gestures vaguely, as if motioning to the world around you. \"The curse doesn't stall unless something's wrong. This isn't balance, it's resistance.\" Her voice dips a little lower. \"You've been pressing against the tide for days, pretending nothing's changing, acting like if you just behave the right way, it'll go away.\"\n\n You open your mouth, but she cuts you off before you can speak.\n\n \"But it doesn't go away, [name]. It never does.\"\n\n You hate how final her voice sounds. Like something's already decided. Like she's already walking away.\n\n Because she is.\n\n You don't follow her.\n \n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n [Choice: Go home]\n \n \n [Choice: Go home]",

Rows of desks, whiteboard already marked with dense notation, and—at the front—Ms. Naomi Tanaka.\n\nShe's young for a teacher—late twenties. She's razor-sharp though, always in crisp slacks and a cardigan like she's ready to explain calculus concepts or sprint into battle. She doesn't waste time with pleasantries. She would never. When Ms. Tanaka starts class, she starts class.\n\nYou slide into your seat near the back as students shuffle in around you, still gossiping about the crazy \"backpacks\" that people have brought in today. Ms. Tanaka lets it go for about ten seconds before clearing her throat.\n\n\"Alright class, today we're diving into implicit differentiation,\" Ms. Tanaka says, already writing on that board. \"if that phrase makes you want to crawl into your desk and disappear, trust me, you're not alone.\"\n\n<<if [study] > 95>> \n You straighten up a little, already flipping to your notes from last week. Finally—something you understand. At least math still makes sense, even if nothing else does.\n<<elseif [study] > 89>> \n You sit up a little straighter. Implicit differentiation isn't your favorite, but you remember enough from last week's notes to feel confident. You already start working ahead as she talks.\n<<elseif [study] > 79>> \n You blink and hope this is one of those days your brain decides to actually cooperate. You write the title at the top of the page and try to look like you understand what's coming.\n\n \n You internally groan. You're still shaky on last week's material, and \"implicit differentiation\" sounds like something that should come with a large red warning label. Your pencil hovers as you hesitate.\n \n\nJust as Ms. Tanaka is about to start her lecture, it happens.\n\nThe overhead PA system clicks on with a faint buzz, followed by the cool, practiced voice of the front office secretary.\n\n''\"Good morning, Pacific Crest. Apologies for the interruption. Could we please have [name] Yoon report to the principal's office immediately? I repeat, could we please have [name] Yoon report to the principal's office immediately? Thank you.\"''\n\nA few heads turn.\n\nA few more eyebrows raise.\n\nMs. Tanaka pauses, Expo marker still in her hand.\n\nYou freeze.\n\nThe room goes still in that awkward way it does when one student gets called out and everyone suddenly wants to know why.\n\nMs. Tanaka raises an eyebrow. \"Well, Mr. Yoon—don't keep the principal waiting.\"\n\nYou nod stiffly and gather your things. You feel every eye on you as you stand. Someone in the back mutters something you can't quite hear—your name mixed with a laugh.\n\nLuke's not in the class. You wish he were so that he could make a dumb joke to cut the tension.\n\nYou step into the hallway, the door swinging shut behind you with a soft click.\n\nAnd suddenly, it's just you.\n\nThe long walk to the principal's office stretches ahead like a spotlight. The kind where everyone's watching. The kind where things start to unravel.\n\nJust like Aurora said.\n\n[Choice: The principal's office]",

The kind of institutional chill that seeps through your sleeves and makes everything feel more sterile than it already is.\n\nThe secretary doesn't even look up when you enter, just gestures toward the door at the end of the hall.\n\nYou know which one.\n\nYou hesitate for only a moment before pushing it open.\n\nPrincipal Thompson is already waiting behind his desk, hands folded over a thick manila folder. He doesn't stand. He doesn't smile. He just gestures to the chair across from him like this is a business meeting, and you're about to get fired.\n\n\"Mr. Yoon,\" he says, his voice cool, clipped, and sharpened to a razor's edge. \"Close the door.\"\n\nYou do.\n\nThen you sit.\n\nThe silence that follows stretches far too long.\n\nFinally, he leans back in his chair, eyes locking on you like he's trying to solve a puzzle he deeply resents even having to look at.\n\n\"You've changed,\" he says flatly. \"A lot. And very quickly.\"\n\nYou don't answer.\n\nHe continues. \"You've gone from being a perfectly normal, clean-cut young man to...\" His eyes flick over you—not subtle and definitely not kind. \"Well. Let's just say your presentation lately has raised some concerns.\"\n\nYour stomach tightens but you say nothing.\n\nHe taps the folder once. It's deliberate. Very much so. \"Two weeks ago, you looked like any other senior boy. Now? I've had multiple staff members ask if you're transitioning, if there's a medical record we weren't informed of, or if there's something going on at home.\"\n\n\"Sir, I—\"\n\nHe cuts you off with a wave of his hand.\n\n\"I am not asking,\" he says sharply. \"I'm telling you what is being discussed. I'm getting phone calls. Anonymous reports. A parent emailed me last night asking why their son has to share a locker hallway with 'something confusing.'\"\n\nYou feel your throat go dry.\n\n\"I, as the principal, have a responsibility to maintain a stable learning environment,\" he continues. \"And whether you realize it or not, your new appearance is disruptive. It invites speculation, rumors, and drama. Things we do not want here at Pacific Crest High School.\"\n\nHe smiles—but there's nothing kind in it. It's the kind of smile people wear when they know they have power.\n\n\"So. Let's talk about what's going on with you, Mr. Yoon.

Instead, you keep your expression even.\n\n \"With all due respect, sir, this doesn't concern you,\" you say, voice calm but clear.\n\n His brow twitches.\n\n You keep going. \"My appearance isn't a violation of any school policy. I'm not disrupting class. I'm not breaking any rules. Whatever people are saying about me—that's their problem, not mine.\"\n\n For a beat, there's silence. You can hear the low hum of the fluorescent office lights overhead. The tapping of a pencil from the front desk, far beyond the closed door.\n\n Principal Thompson leans back in his chair, folding his arms slowly across his chest.\n\n \"Interesting choice of words,\" he says quietly. \"But let's make one thing clear: everything that causes disruption on this campus is my business.\"\n\n He stares you down. \"You think you're being clever. Calm. Maybe even reasonable. But you're underestimating how fast perception becomes reality. You walk into school looking the way you do now, and people start drawing their own conclusions. That creates confusion. Discomfort. Instability. And when the hallway turns into a rumor mill, and my staff start asking questions—I have to answer them.\"\n\n You hold your ground, eyes locked on his.\n\n \"Right now, you're a conversation,\" he says, voice lowering. \"If you're not careful, you'll become a case. And cases? Well, those come with paperwork. Meetings. Parent involvement. Superintendent reviews.\"\n\n He leans forward now.\n\n \"And trust me—once that process starts, you don't get to control how it ends.\"\n\n The words hang in the air like smoke—professional on the surface, sure, but every syllable drips with threat. This isn't just about policy. This is about making you small.\n\n You sit still, jaw tight, heart pounding behind your calm exterior.\n\n Principal Thompson leans back, folding his hands again. A smile appears on his face.\n\n \"Now. Do you want to try that answer again?\"\n\n \n You shift in your seat, doing your best to keep your expression neutral. \"I've just been trying some stuff out,\" you say, trying to stay casual. \"Style, hair, whatever. It's really not that deep.\"\n\n Principal Thompson raises an eyebrow—slowly and deliberately. Then he leans back in his chair like you've just told him the most insulting joke he's ever heard.\n\n \"'It's not that deep,'\" he repeats, flat voice and icy. \"That's your explanation for why half the school thinks you're showing up to class in drag?\"\n\n Your stomach drops.\n\n He flips open the folder on his desk methodically and pulls out a printed photo from what looks like a security camera still. You're blurry in it but the angle catches enough of your face to look soft in the light.\n\n He slides it toward you like a piece of evidence in a trial. \"This doesn't look like a phase, does it? This looks like someone trying very hard to be something they're not.\"\n\n You stare at the photo. You remember you were just walking to class that day. You didn't feel like anything.\n\n \"I'm not accusing you of breaking any written rules,\" he says, stressing the word like it's some gracious concession. \"But you're walking a fine line, Mr. Yoon. A very fine line. When a student becomes the center of gossip, distraction, and discomfort... that becomes my problem.\"\n\n You look up at him and see he's not angry. He's enjoying this—the control he gets to have and that he gets to decide what's normal or not.\n\n \"I'm giving you the opportunity to be honest before this becomes something we have to escalate,\" he continues. \"Because once the school board starts asking, it won't be me you'll be talking to.\"\n\n He folds his hands again. Still smiling.\n \n \"Now. Do you want to try that answer again?\"\n\n \n You feel the heat rising in your chest before he even finishes talking. That smug tone and that little power-trip smile—it crawls under your skin and sticks.\n\n You grip the edge of your chair. Tight.\n\n \"I'm not breaking any rules,\" you snap. \"I come to class and I do my work. I haven't hurt anyone. You just don't like that I don't look like your idea of what a 'normal boy' should.\"\n\n Principal Thompson's smile tightens at the corners a little. It's just enough to crack the mask.\n\n \"Oh, I see,\" he says slowly. \"So now I'm the problem.\"\n\n You sit up straighter. \"I mean, you're dragging me into your office and interrogating me about my appearance like I've done something wrong. I don't know. That kind of is a problem if you ask me.\"\n\n The silence crackles. His jaw flexes once. Then he taps his fingers against the desk, once, twice, before leaning in.\n\n \"Watch your tone, Mr. Yoon,\" he says, voice low now. \"This isn't about me. It's about how your peers are reacting. About how your behavior—your choices—are making people uncomfortable.\"\n\n You laugh bitterly. \"So what? You're calling me in here because someone else feels weird about the way I look?\"\n\n Principal Thompson doesn't flinch. He doesn't even blink. He leans forward even further, voice dropping so low it scrapes the edge of a whisper.\n\n You stiffen.\n\n \"I've worked in schools for over twenty years, and I've seen this before,\" he continues. \"A student starts dressing and acting differently. Says it's just a 'style thing.' But then comes the attention. The rumors. The fights. The phone calls. The incident reports. And then suddenly, the same kid is crying in a disciplinary hearing, wondering how it all got so bad.\"\n\n His eyes lock onto you, something calculating going on behind them.\n\n \"And I don't do messes. I don't do disruption. So let me be very clear: if you keep testing the boundaries—if you keep pushing the school, the students, the faculty—then I will respond.\"\n\n He leans back, calm again. A smile returns to his face.\n\n \"Now. Do you want to try that answer again?\"\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

You say nothing.\n\nHe watches you, waiting, giving you one last imaginary chance to backpedal.\n\nYou don't take it.\n\nHe exhales through his nose—not tired, not exasperated. Just... smug. Like this is exactly what he wanted.\n\n\"Very well,\" he says, voice smooth as glass and twice as cold. \"I can see you're not interested in cooperation. And that's fine. But let me explain how this is going to work now—since you clearly need the structure.\"\n\nHe leans forward slowly and deliberately, elbows on the desk and fingers laced.\n\n\"You are now under administrative observation. That means I've spoken with your teachers. Several of them already had concerns. From this point on, they'll be submitting weekly behavioral and appearance notes directly to me. Everything goes in your file. Every tardy. Every dress code technicality. Every instance of classroom disruption—real or perceived.\"\n\nHe pauses, like he wants to let that sink in. Then continues, quieter now, each word sharpened to a point.\n\n\"I don't care if it's an untucked shirt or a whispered rumor in the hallway. If it lands on my desk, I will use it. And when that file is thick enough? I'll take it to the district.\"\n\nHe straightens, smoothing his tie, voice rising just slightly—not loud but just enough to let you know he enjoys this.\n\n\"I'll recommend a formal disciplinary review. You'll be pulled from extracurriculars. Reassigned from group projects. Maybe even get temporarily placed in our off-site behavioral track. You know, the place for students who can't quite adapt to the environment here.\"\n\nHe tilts his head, mock sympathy dripping from his words. \"That track doesn't look good on college applications. Or scholarship paperwork. Or anything, really. But I'm sure a student as capable as you will land on your feet.\"\n\nHe paces a few steps behind his desk now, hands clasped behind his back. \"You want to look the way you do, act the way you act, and still pretend you're just another student here?\" He stops. \"Then don't slip.\"\n\nHe looks at you like a hawk circling something already bleeding.\n\n\"Because if you do—even once—I'll be waiting. And I promise you, [name]. The next meeting won't be this polite.\"\n\nSilence stretches.\n\nFinally, he walks back to his desk, taps a manila folder once, and says—without looking at you:\n\n\"You're dismissed.\"\n\nThat's it.\n\nYou rise, quietly and carefully. Like the floor might break beneath you if you make one wrong move.\n\nYou open the office door. Step into the hallway.\n\nThe door clicks shut behind you with a sound that feels heavier than wood and metal should.\n\nYou start walking, slowly. The buzz of fluorescent lights above, the muted sound of class happening behind doors you can't open yet.\n\nThe day isn't over, but it's certainly changed.\n\nAnd so have the rules.\n\n[Choice: What do you do now?]",

Buzzing.\n\nRumors.\n\nYou can feel it the moment you walk in, lunch tray in hand. People aren't being subtle about it. Heads turn. Conversations hush as you pass, only to pick up again, even faster, behind your back. Laughter flares across the room—sharp and short, the kind that's about something, not with them.\n\nYou keep your head down and slide into your usual spot as the table. Luke's already there, halfway through some chicken tenders. Samantha arrives seconds later, balancing her tray with one hand and texting with the other, thumb moving faster than most people's brains.\n\nLuke blinks at you. \"Dude, you okay?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we're concerned,\" Samantha says, putting down her tray. She quietly places her phone face-down and looks at you, her bright green eyes filled with worry. \"What happened?\"\n\nYou shrug and stab at your lunch without answering.\n\n\"Come on, [name]. You can tell us, we're your best friends. You look like someone told you your dog just died.\"\n\nYou try to stay quiet. You try to focus on chewing. But the noise around you? It's deafening.\n\n \n \"—he got pulled out of class. It's probably for that hormone thing Jess was talking about—\"\n\n \"—I dunno, I heard he's on estrogen for a medical issue or something? She said it was private—\"\n\n \"—yeah, like something embarrassing. Like his body wasn't doing something right?\"\n\n \"—so he's not trans, he just looks like that now?\"\n\n \"—well, he acts like it. And did you see what he wore the other day?\"\n\n Some of the comments are less cruel but the undertone is still there—analyzing, poking, trying to fit you into a story they think they've heard before.\n\n \"—I heard it's like, a condition? Like his body is just messed up and that's why—\"\n\n \"—Jessica said not to talk about it, so it's probably real.\"\n\n \"I bet he hates that people know.\"\n\n \n \"—he got pulled out of class, like called to the fucking office—\"\n\n \"—I swear he looks so different, look at this—\"\n\n \"—someone said he's faking it for attention, like, pretending to be trans or whatever—\"\n\n \"—no, I heard he's using the girl's bathroom now—\"\n\n \"—it's gotta be one of those mental health things, right? Like he snapped or something—\"\n\n \"—I dunno, man, I think he's doing it on purpose. Look at him, he wants all of the attention—\"\n \n\nThe words are constant and circling. They're flickering just outside your peripheral hearing, like a mosquito buzzing next to your ear.\n\nSamantha scoots her tray a little closer, resting her elbows on the table, voice low. \"[name],\" she says, gently but firmly. \"We're not doing the whole 'pretend nothing's wrong' thing today, okay?\"\n\nYou keep your eyes on your food. The noise around you feels like it's closing in—every whisper, every glance.\n\nLuke leans in next, his usual grin gone and replaced with a rare seriousness. \"Did Thompson say something? I always hated the guy. You didn't just get called to the office to talk about something casual, man.\"\n\nYou push your tray away slowly. \"He... yeah. He knows something's off. Or thinks he does.\"\n\n \n \"You know, there's something I haven't told you,\" you say, voice low. \"Something... big.\"\n\n Samantha straightens, suddenly very focused.\n\n Luke blinks. \"Okay. Well, that's ominous. Go on.\"\n\n You take a breath, and then you say it.\n\n \"There's a [referto] on me right now.\"\n\n They both stare at you. Neither of them laughs.\n\n \"Is this like... metaphorically?\" Samantha asks, furrowing her brow. \"Or are we talking full-on witch level bullshit.\"\n\n \"Full-on witch level bullshit,\" you respond. \"Something happened at the Autumn Festival with the fortune teller—Madame Serena. She said some cryptic stuff and I've been changing ever since.\"\n\n Luke's eyes widen. \"Wait—like an actual [referto] or something?\"\n\n You nod. \"Every time I do something... emotional, or vulnerable, or feminine, something shifts. It's slow. But it's real.\"\n\n You expect disbelief or laughter. But instead, Samantha just leans back with her arms crossed.\n\n \"So that's why you've been changing,\" she says, like it's the final piece in a puzzle she didn't want to admit existed. \"And... everything else.\"\n\n \"Holy shit, dude,\" Luke says, his mouth half-open. \"That's like—that's real? I mean, it makes sense, but still. That's what's been going on?\"\n\n You nod again.\n\n There's a pause.\n\n Then Samantha sighs. \"God. First of all, that's insane. Second of all... why the hell didn't you tell us earlier?\"\n\n \"I didn't know how to, you begin. \"I didn't want you to think I was—\"\n\n \"Weird?\" Luke offers. \"Too late.\"\n\n Samantha shoots him a look, then turns back to you, gentler now. \"You're a disaster, sure. But you're our disaster.\"\n\n \n \nLuke's eyes narrow. \"What does the principal suspect though? Like 'off?' What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Well, he said people are talking,\" you say. \"Teachers, parents, and students. He's getting emails. He said I'm causing a disruption.\"\n\nLuke lets out a breath and shakes his head. \"Man, that guy sucks.\"\n\nSamantha's face darkens. \"What else?\"\n\nYou hesitate, then finally look up at them. \"He said I'm under administrative observation now. Basically, I'm being watched. Weekly reports. Behavior logs. Appearance notes. If I screw up even once, he'll escalate it. Try to get me removed.\"\n\nThere's a long pause. Samantha's lip press into a thin line. Her sarcasm drops.\n\n\"That's not just being a hardass,\" she mutters. \"That's calculated. He's trying to scare you into backing down.\"\n\n\"Man, he can't do that though, right?\" Luke asks, brows knitting together. \"There's, like, laws and stuff. You haven't done anything wrong.\"\n\n\"I know,\" you say quietly. \"But he knows how to make it look like I did.\"\n\nNo one says anything for a few seconds.\n\nThen Samantha reaches across the table and taps your hand once—quick but deliberate. \"He's not going to win. You know that, right, [name]?\"\n\nYou look at her.\n\n\"You've made it this far,\" she adds. \"It's been weird. And hard. And messy as hell, let me tell you. But you're still here.\"\n\nLuke nods. \"We've got you, man. If he comes at you, we just gotta come back louder.\"\n\nYou stare at them—your best friends are somehow making the noise fade just a little.\n\n\"I mean, if it comes to it, I'll totally fake a scandal and take the heat off you,\" Samantha says. You can't tell if she's joking or serious. \"I've always wanted to be suspended for something dramatic.\"\n\nYou can't help but laugh a little.\n\nFor a moment, it feels manageable again.\n\n[Choice: Get through lunch]",

The paint's a little more chipped here, the lights overhead buzz a bit louder, and the occasional mystery draft seeps in through the windows that don't close all the way.\n\nThe vending machine alcove near the janitor's office is a dead zone. It's half-lit, echoes way too much, and always smells faintly of mop water and sadness. You figure if Aurora were going to hole up somewhere weird and inconvenient, this would be in her top five.\n\nBut instead of mystical vibes or cryptic warnings, you hear—\n\n\"You thieving corporate bastard!\"\n\nYou round the corner just in time to see Samantha, your chaotic best friend, furiously slapping the side of a vending machine like it owes her rent. One of her sneakers is kicked off to the side. Her hands are half-covered in vending grime. A packet of hot chips is dangling from the spiral dispenser like it's hanging on for dear life.\n\n\"Seriously?\" she growls, punching the 'B3' button again like it personally betrayed her. \"You're gonna take my money, tease me, and then ghost me? Classic male behavior.\"\n\nYou lean on the wall, watching the drama unfold.\n\nShe doesn't notice you right away. After all, she's far too focused on attempting a snack heist. She gives the machine one last dramatic slap and then sighs, leaning her forehead against the plexiglass like she just lost a battle she'll never live down.\n\n\"You alright?\" you ask, voice amused.\n\nShe jumps slightly, then whips around. \"Christ, [name]! Don't sneak up on people when they're going through a rage ritual!\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"So... you and the vending machine having a rough patch?\"\n\n\"He took my fucking dollar.\"\n\nYou can't help but grin. For the swirling chaos of today, this moment feels strangely... normal.\n\nYou step forward, cock your head at the machine, and give it a sharp, strategic kick. You hit it right near the base, where the frame is the weakest.\n\nThere's a low mechanical clunk and then the stubborn packet of hot chips gives up and spirals down into the tray.\n\nSamantha blinks. Then slowly turns to you with awe, as if she just witnessed a minor miracle.\n\n\"When the hell did you become a vending machine whisperer?\" she asks.\n\nYou shrug. \"I just have a strong foot.\"\n\nShe retrieves the hot chips, holds the packet to her chest like a prized artifact, and sighs deeply. \"I take back 30% of the slander I've spoken about you this month.\"\n\n\"Only 30?\"\n\n\"Let's not get greedy.\"\n\nShe leans against the vending machine, now slightly less hostile toward it, and eyes you for a moment.\n\n\"You wanna talk about what's going on?\" she asks, her expression softening. \"I could also keep yelling at snack machines until you feel better.\"\n\n[Choice: Open up to her]\n[Choice: Keep it light]\n[Choice: Ask if she's seen Aurora]",

The buzzing fluorescent light above flickers just slightly, like even it's bracing for some emotional turbulence.\n\n Samantha's still watching you, her usual smirk dialed down to something softer. Her arms are loosely crossed and her hot chips stay forgotten in one hand.\n\n You glance over at her. \"We kind of talked about it at lunch, but...\"\n\n You trail off.\n\n She doesn't interrupt. Doesn't push. Just waits, quiet in a way only your best friend can be when something actually matters.\n\n You stare ahead at nothing in particular. \"I'm scared.\"\n\n There. It's out. It sounds stupid, but it's real.\n\n \"I keep trying to act like I'm above it,\" you continue. \"Like Thompson doesn't get to me, or like the rumors don't matter. But they do. They all do.\"\n\n Samantha nods once. \"Yeah. That tracks.\"\n\n You glance at her, expecting a joke. Some snark. But she's still quiet.\n\n So you keep going.\n\n <<if [acceptance] > 19>> \n \"I'm not ashamed of what's happening to me. Not anymore. But that doesn't mean it's easy. Every hallway I walk down, every look, every whisper, it all makes me feel like I can't just exist. Like I have to justify it. I didn't choose this [referto], but... I'm not running from it.\"\n \n \n \"I'm tired of pretending I don't care. Every hallway I walk down, every sideways look, every stupid whisper—it's like I'm being erased and put in the spotlight at the same time. I didn't ask for this [referto], I didn't ask for these changes, and now I feel like no matter what I do, someone's waiting for me to slip.\"\n \n \n Samantha shifts, gently bumping her shoulder into yours. \"You don't have to explain why this sucks. It just does.\"\n\n You nod again. \"And Thompson? He's not even pretending to hide it. He wants to catch me doing something. Anything. And the worst part is that I feel like he will.\"\n\n There's a pause, and then, quieter:\n\n \"I don't know how much longer I can keep pushing.\"\n\n Samantha sighs, muttering, \"That piece of shit.\"\n\n You almost laugh. \"Which one?\"\n\n She side-eyes you. \"Pick one.\"\n\n She goes quiet for a moment, then uncrosses her arms and looks over at you fully. \"You don't have to pretend around me. Not about the fear, not about the weirdness, not about the fact that your life's becoming some gender-bender manga.\"\n\n \"You make it all sound so simple,\" you say, huffing.\n\n \"Come on, I've got you,\" she says, smirking. \"Even when it's messy. Especially when it's messy.\"\n\n The knot in your chest loosens just a little.\n\n \"I'm still gonna scream at vending machines, though,\" she adds, holding up the hot chips like it's a trophy. \"Rage is healing.\"\n\n You finally laugh, feeling a little better. Not because anything's been fixed, but because someone's here with you.\n\n \n You lightly nudge your shoulder into Samantha's, letting a smirk tug at the corner of your mouth.\n\n \"So,\" you say, tilting your head toward the vending machine, \"was that an actual exorcism or just your usual snack-based meltdown?\"\n\n She scoffs and rolls her eyes. \"It was performance art, thank you very much. A biting critique of capitalism, rage culture, and poorly stocked vending machines.\"\n\n \"Oh, I see, that was very moving,\" you say sarcastically, using Samantha's techniques against her. \"I think I saw a ghost leave the Pringles.\"\n\n She points at you with the hot chip bag. \"If I don't get sodium and synthetic cheese powder into my bloodstream in the next five minutes, you're getting drop-kicked into the trash can, [name].\"\n\n You both laugh. The joke's not particularly funny, and the both of you are definitely laughing louder than the moment deserves, but it's nice anyway.\n \n \"You're deflecting, by the way,\" Samantha says, still wheezing.\n\n \"Who, me?\"\n\n \"Yes, you,\" she states. \"This is classic 'ha-ha, vending machine bad, don't look at my emotional trauma' energy.\"\n\n You pretend to consider that. \"I have no idea what you're talking about. I am a well-adjusted member of society.\"\n\n \"You cried during that old Clancy's commercial with the kid and the chicken nugget shaped like Idaho.\"\n\n \"Okay, okay, first of all, that was a powerful narrative about identity, geography, and the meat industry.\"\n\n Samantha snorts. \"The kid named the nugget and fucking saluted before eating it, [name].\"\n\n \"It was absolute cinema, alright?\"\n\n She snorts. \"Sure it was.\"\n\n You both fall into an easy silence, the kind that only happens when someone knows you well enough to let the avoidance be part of the process.\n\n She doesn't push and you don't explain. But you know you'll get there when you're ready.\n\n Samantha will still be here. With hot chips and threats.\n\n \n You turn to Samantha, who's still clutching her victorious hot chips like it personally saved her life.\n\n \"Hey,\" you say. \"Have you seen Aurora today?\"\n\n She raises an eyebrow. \"Why? Are you trying to summon a ghost or get hexed?\"\n\n You blink. \"What?\"\n\n \"I haven't seen her,\" Samantha says. \"And when I don't see her, I consider that a blessing. Because every time I do, she's in some weird corner of the school looking like she's about to curse a bloodline.\"\n\n You try not to laugh. \"You're scared of her?\"\n\n \"I'm wary of her,\" she corrects, holding up a finger. \"There's a difference, alright? One time in sophomore year, I made the mistake of saying she looked like she was from a period drama. She didn't blink. Just stared at me for a full ten seconds and then said, 'Perhaps I've lived many lives.' Like, what the fuck am I supposed to do with that?\"\n\n \"Run?\"\n\n \"Exactly! And she wears that pentagram thing around her neck like she's training to summon a demon. I'm not trying to get turned into a scorpion. I respect her from afar.\"\n\n You shake your head, grinning. \"I'm not asking you to form a coven with her. I just thought maybe you saw her.\"\n\n \"No sightings,\" Samantha says, shrugging. \"She tends to show up when she wants to. Or when you least want her to.\"\n\n You sigh. \"That figures.\"\n\n \"If she does show up, maybe warm me so I can duck behind a bush or something.\"\n\n \"Will do.\"\n\n \"Good,\" she says. \"I don't trust people who can make eye contact that long without blinking.\"\n\n You laugh and glance back toward the end of the hallway.\n\n Still no sign of Aurora.

It burns immediately.\n\n\"So?\" she says, licking orange-red powder off her fingertips. \"Is the pain numbing your trauma yet?\"\n\n\"A little,\" you croak. \"My mouth might be bleeding, though.\"\n\n\"Perfect,\" she says. \"That's the spice of healing.\"\n\nFor a while, you sit there in that school hallway, passing the bag back and forth, heat building on your tongues and in your lungs.

So are you for bringing that.\"\n\n \n Eventually, you stand, brushing crumbs off your pants, and swing your regular, boring backpack over your shoulder.\n\n Samantha watches you do it, completely unimpressed.\n\n \"Wow,\" she says dryly. \"Real bold of you to show up to Bring Anything But a Backpack Day with a backpack. That's some revolutionary school spirit right there.\"\n\n You shrug. \"I didn't feel like hauling a grill across campus.\"\n\n She rolls her eyes. \"That's lame. I hope it haunts your college applications.\"\n \n\n\"Okay, fine, then what did you bring?\"\n\nSamantha grins like she's been waiting for this.\n\nWithout a word, she reaches behind her and yanks up a plastic cat litter box. It's without the litter, thank God, but definitely not the cleanest-looking object you've ever seen. There's a tangle of notebooks, pens, and a suspiciously dented water bottle crammed inside.\n\nYou stare at it.\n\n\"I cleaned it!\" she says, beaming. \"Mostly.\"\n\n\"And you were seriously judging me?\" you say.\n\n\"Hey,\" she says, holding the litter box. \"Mine has a lid.\"\n\nTouché.\n\n\"Well, I should get going,\" you say.\n\nSamantha nods sagely. \"Go chase your destiny, o foolish one.\"\n\nShe pauses before adding: \"Text me if anything gets weird. Weirder. You know what I mean.\"\n\nYou nod. \"Thanks for the chips. And... everything.\"\n\nShe shrugs like it's no big deal. \"We all need a snack break before emotional ruin.\"\n\nAnd with that, you step back into the hallway.

Helmet on the ground, shoulder pads off, and sweat-darkened T-shirt clinging to his back. He's running routes, tossing the ball to himself, catching it with practiced ease, then looping around and doing it all again.\n\nYou stop just at the edge of the field, near the low metal bleachers. He notices you after a second and jogs over, brushing damp hair from his forehead.\n\n\"Yo!\" he calls, breathless but grinning. \"Didn't think I'd see you out here. Are you lost or just here to vibe?\"\n\nYou shrug. \"Bit of both, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Luke says, laughing. You notice that he's got turf on his socks and grass on his elbows. He looks down at the football in his hands for a few beats before lifting it up. \"Wanna toss?\"\n\nHe doesn't press. He wouldn't. He just waits with a wide smile plastered on his face.\n\nBut you were here for something else—someone else.\n\nStill, maybe it's worth stopping for a minute and asking if he's seen anything.\n\n[Choice: Join him for a few passes]\n[Choice: Ask if he's seen Aurora]\n[Choice: Just sit on the bleachers and watch]",

Just a few passes.\"\n\n Luke lights up instantly, jogging backward to give you space. \"Oh, hell yeah! I knew you had spiral potential!\"\n\n \"I literally just agreed to throw a ball,\" you say, raising an eyebrow. \"Don't draft me yet.\"\n\n He points a dramatic finger at you, eyes blazing. \"Well, this is how dynasties begin. This is going to be the next New England Patriots dynasty. You? Me? [name]? Luke? We're about to revolutionize high school football history.\"\n\n You blink. \"I don't even know how to play.\"\n\n He ignores that completely. \"Doesn't matter. Tom Brady was picked in the sixth round of the draft, you know. Every great duo starts somewhere.\"\n\n \"Am I Brady or Belichick in this situation?\" you ask, squinting at him.\n\n \"You're Edelman,\" he says immediately. \"You've got scrappy slot receiver energy.\"\n\n \"... I don't know what that means, but it feels like an insult.\"\n\n \"It's absolutely a compliment.\"\n\n You snort and take your place opposite him. He backs up a little more, dropping into a half-crouch.\n\n \"Okay, ready?\" he calls.\n\n <<if [athleticism] > 69>> \n You nod, and he sends the ball your way—a clean spiral, fast and tight.\n\n You track it easily, step into it, and snag it out of the air with a satisfying pop.\n\n Luke actually whistles. \"Okay, damn. That was good.\"\n\n You spin the ball in your hands with mock smugness. \"What can I say? Hidden talents.\"\n\n \"This changes everything,\" Luke says, grinning. \"I'm calling the 49ers. We need a new dynasty.\"\n <<elseif [athleticism] > 59>> \n You nod, and he sends the ball your way—a clean spiral, sharp but you think you can catch it.\n\n You catch it.\n\n Sort of.\n\n It hits your palms, wobbles for a terrifying moment, and you fumble it once before finally clutching it to your chest.\n\n \"Nice save!\" Luke calls. \"That was like... 80% skill, 20% divine intervention!\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"I'll take it.\"\n\n He grins. \"Hey, I've seen some freshmen drop worse. You're not completely cursed.\"\n \n \n You nod, and he launches the ball—a tight spiral, clean and fast.\n\n You do your best. You really do.\n\n But it bounces off your palms, spins dramatically in the air, and lands in the grass with a sad thud.\n\n Luke jogs over, eyes wide. \"Okay, okay! That was... close! You almost caught it!\"\n\n \"Pretty sure the ball had beef with me,\" you murmur, staring at your hands like they betrayed you.\n\n \"Don't worry,\" Luke replies, grinning. \"All great dynasties have humble beginnings.\"\n \n\n You throw it back, and it reaches Luke. He fumbles dramatically like he's in a movie, stumbles a step, and falls back onto the grass with a loud, theatrical \"AUGH!\"\n\n You jog over, pretending to be concerned. \"Oh no. Is the drama fatal?\"\n\n He holds the ball to his chest, eyes shut. \"Tell my mom... I loved her. And also, check my locker for a biology project I forgot to turn in.\"\n\n You roll your eyes and offer him a hand. He takes it and pops up with way too much energy.\n\n You toss the ball again, and soon you're falling into a rhythm. Back and forth. Throw. Catch. Run. Breathe.\n\n The kind of rhythm that lets your brain pause.\n\n Eventually, Luke jogs over and flops next to you in the grass, both of you panting a little, grinning like idiots.\n\n \"You've got decent hands,\" he says between breaths. \"In a pinch, I'd trust you as a backup wide receiver.\"\n\n \"I'll put that on my college applications,\" you say.\n\n Luke chuckles and lies back, arms spread. \"Man, it's nice today.\"\n\n You follow his gaze—sky stretching wide above you, clouds lazy and pale, the world just quiet enough to feel possible again.\n\n No rumors. No Thompson. No stares.\n\n Just you and your best friend, tossing a football around.\n\n \n You step closer, shading your eyes a little against the afternoon sun. \"Hey, this is a random question, but have you seen Aurora today?\"\n\n Luke tilts his head, frowning slightly. \"Aurora?\" he echoes, like he's trying to remember if that's the name of a student or maybe an ancient wizard from a fantasy novel.\n\n \"The girl who wears black all the time,\" you say, trying to jog his memory. \"Looks like she haunts abandoned bookstores for fun.\"\n\n \"Ohhh, her.\" Luke nods, then squints. \"Yeah, no. I haven't seen her.\"\n\n You sigh.\n\n \"She kinda shows up and disappears, right?\" he continues, casually spinning the football in his hands. \"Like one of those NPCs in a video game. You blink and she's just standing behind you with a riddle or something.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you mutter. \"That sounds about right for her.\"\n\n He wipes sweat off his brow with the edge of his sleeve. \"Why? She not returning your dark prophecies or something?\"\n\n You chuckle, but it's tired. \"I was just hoping she might have some... clarity. After today.\"\n\n Luke's grin fades a bit. He doesn't ask more, just nods. \"Sorry, dude. I'll keep an eye out, but I haven't seen her. But hey, if she's gonna show up, it'll probably be in some dramatic-ass place. Like you'll see her under the bleachers, surrounded by dead birds.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you say, laughing despite yourself. \"I'll check the dead bird corner next.\"\n\n Luke gives you a salute. \"If she shows up and you disappear into an alternative realm or whatever, text me first.\"\n\n \"I'll keep that in mind.\"\n\n \n \"I'll just watch,\" you say.\n\n \"Cool,\" Luke says, jogging backward a few steps with a goofy grin on his face. \"Lemme know if I look dramatic enough for a sports movie montage.\"\n\n You climb up the rusted metal bleachers, the steps creaking slightly under your weight, and plop down near the top row. The sun's warm on your face and the field stretches out in front of you. You look at Luke. Really look. His shirt's clinging to him from sweat and his cheeks are a little red from running drills in the afternoon heat.\n \n He takes a few deep breaths—\n\n And with that, he's back at it. He launches into running routes, tossing the ball up into the air with a spiral, pivoting on a dime, and then sprinting back to the starting point. It's messy and loose, but there's something kind of graceful about it.\n\n You lean your elbows on your knees and just watch.\n\n No one's looking at you. No one's whispering. No one's asking questions you're not ready to answer. It's just Luke, being Luke, and the quiet rhythm of cleats thudding against turf.\n\n Every now and then he glances back to check if you're still there.\n\n You are.\n\n You don't say much, but you don't really have to.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

The building's quieter than usual—low afternoon sunlight filters through the tall windows, and the air carries that specific, ancient paper smell that only school libraries seem to preserve.\n\n You pass the front desk. The school librarian doesn't even look up from her crossword puzzle.\n\n You don't go to the main tables. Instead, you take the path past the biographies, take a left at the broken printer with the big \"Out of Order\" sign, and head toward the back corner—the one with the old armchair, the crooked reading lamp, and the huge window that turns golden right before sunset.\n\n It's empty. Almost.\n\n You slow your steps when you spot Vincent already there, hunched over a copy of A Brief History of Time, legs pulled up on the seat like he's afraid someone might try to talk to him.\n\n The horror.\n\n He looks up as you approach and immediately straightens—like you've caught him doing something illegal or worse, deeply embarrassing.\n\n \"Oh! Uh—hey, [name]!\" he says too fast. \"Didn't see you. I mean—I did see you, eventually, just not at first, because the sun hit your—anyway, hi.\"\n\n You blink. \"Hey. I was just looking for someone.\"\n\n Vincent nods quickly, then closes his book—not with a snap, but with a slow, gentle apology to the pages. He shifts in his seat, visibly trying not to fidget.\n\n \"You looking for Aurora?\" he asks.\n\n You pause. \"Yeah, I was, actually. How'd you know?\"\n\n He gestures vaguely toward the seat next to him. \"She's... kind of the only person who ever sits back here beside me. When she's not, like, vanishing into fog or turning up in a locked room.\"\n\n You smirk. That sounds like Aurora.\n\n Then Vincent squints, suddenly more serious. \"Wait. Is this about... all the stuff going on?\"\n\n \"What do you mean?\" you ask, hesitating.\n\n Vincent winces, like he didn't mean to say it out loud. \"Just, um... people are talking. A lot. And if even I'm hearing about it—and I usually get left out of all things social unless someone needs help with their history test—it's like, a lot-lot.\"\n\n You sit down beside him, the chair creaking faintly.\n\n He glances at you, uncertain. \"Are you okay?

The place is quieter than usual. No soft chatter from the front tables or shuffling from study groups. There's just the low hum of the prehistoric ventilation system and the faint scent of paper, dust, and whatever weird tea the librarian always seems to be brewing behind the desk.\n\n You head toward the back corner. Hidden away from the oversized encyclopedias and an old globe that still has the USSR on it. It's a good place to disappear.\n\n But someone's already there.\n\n Vincent.\n\n Hunched over a thick book, glasses sliding slightly down his nose, eyes scanning the page like he's trying to decode the secrets of the universe. Which, knowing Vincent, he probably is.\n\n You slow down, unsure whether to keep going. You haven't exactly been... kind to him lately. A few sarcastic remarks and a couple of moments where you definitely brushed him off. Definitely enough for him to notice.\n\n He looks up when he hears your footsteps. His eyes meet yours for half a second.\n\n \"Oh,\" he says flatly. \"Hey.\"\n\n He doesn't smile.\n\n \"You, uh... seen Aurora around?\" you ask, hovering awkwardly.\n\n Vincent blinks, then returns his gaze to his book. \"Nope.\"\n\n Silence.\n\n You linger a beat longer. He flips a page.\n\n \"She usually hangs out around here, right?\n\n He shrugs without looking up. \"Sometimes. Not today, though.\"\n\n You wait but he offers nothing.\n\n No follow-up. No concern. No nervous ramble. No offer to help.\n\n Just the rustle of pages and the sound of him underlining something with a mechanical pencil.\n\n You're just a shadow in his periphery now—background noise. He doesn't tell you to leave, sure, but he certainly doesn't invite you to stay either.\n\n Eventually, the silence gets too heavy.\n\n You turn and walk away. Aurora's not here, but even if she was, Vincent's not helping you find her.\n\n Not after how you treated him.\n\n [Choice: Go back to the courtyard]",

Then: \"But you did get called to the principal's office today. And there are people saying some really messed up stuff. So, like... I know I'm not the president of the Emotional Vulnerability Club or anything, but don't lie. You were just like... deflecting.\"\n\n Vincent sighs. \"I just—look, I'm not great at people. But I do know when someone's using humor as a coping mechanism. I read about it.\"\n\n There's a pause as you don't know how to respond.\n\n Vincent fidgets with his sleeve. \"You don't have to explain everything to me. I just don't want you to act like you're fine if you're... y'know. Not.\"\n\n It's not a confrontation or a lecture. It's just... sincere. And that's somehow harder to deal with.\n\n \n \n You exhale slowly, staring out the big window for a moment before turning back to Vincent.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, voice lower than you expected. \"I'm... not really okay.\"\n\n Vincent blinks, startled.\n\n He closes his book fully now, resting it in his lap like it's less important than you. \"What happened?\"\n\n You glance around instinctively—no one's nearby, no one listening. Just dusty books, golden sunlight, and Vincent. His brow furrowed and eyes wide behind those thick glasses. He looks nervous, like he's afraid for you.\n\n You lean back against the chair, arms crossed, heart heavier than you'd like.\n\n \"I got called into the principal's office today,\" you say. \"Mr. Thompson... he basically said I'm being watched now. That the way I look, the way people talk about me—it's a distraction. A disruption.\"\n\n Vincent's brows knit.\n\n \"He didn't say it outright, but he made things pretty clear,\" you continue. \"Basically, if I keep showing up like this—if I slip up even once—he'll escalate it. He wants me quiet. Normal. Whatever the hell that means.\"\n\n There's a pause. You didn't mean to say this much. Not really. It just all kind of spilled out.\n\n Vincent fidgets with the corner of his sleeve. \"That's... really messed up.\"\n\n You don't say anything.\n\n He swallows, then looks up at you again. \"I mean, it makes sense. Why people are talking. I mean—not that they should, mind you, but—just...\" He trails off, then starts again, voice steadier. \"I'm sorry. That you're going through this.\"\n\n \"Thanks, Vincent.\"\n\n Vincent's quiet for a second longer. Then, quietly:\n\n \"You don't look wrong, you know. You just look like... you.\"\n\n That one sentence lands heavier than anything. Maybe because it's not dramatic or profound. It's just honest.\n\n You glance at him. He's looking down again, red in the ears.\n\n Then he adds, softer. \"If you ever need, like, a hiding space? Or a Charlemagne fact to scare someone away? I'm around.\"\n\n You laugh—a real one, small but sharp.\n\n Maybe things are spiraling. Maybe Thompson's still breathing down your neck. But for now, in this quiet corner of the library, someone's got your back.\n\n And that helps a lot.\n\n \n You shift in your seat, suddenly very aware of how close the walls feel back here. The chair creaks again as you lean forward, arms resting on your knees.\n\n \"Uh, so, what're you reading?\" you mumble, rubbing the back of your neck.\n\n Vincent blinks. There's a beat before he answers.\n\n \"Oh,\" he says, lifting the book a little. \"Just... you know. Light reading. Astrophysics, the usual.\"\n\n <<if [study] > 89>> \n You nod.\n \n \n You raise an eyebrow.\n \n\n \"It was this or re-reading something for the millionth time, and I decided to branch out,\" he adds quickly. \"Plus this one's got footnotes!\"\n\n You can't help but chuckle under your breath at his enthusiasm.\n\n He opens his book again, and you watch his eyes light up the way they always do when he gets the green light to start rambling.\n\n \"So, okay, get this—Hawking has this whole thing about imaginary time, right? Like time that doesn't exist in a measurable way but still influences the structure of reality. It's kind of like mood lighting for the universe.\"\n\n <<if [study] > 89>> \n You nod, fascinated by his words.\n \n \n You don't really follow, but you nod anyway.\n \n\n Vincent keeps talking animatedly, not demanding anything of you except maybe a laugh or a nod. And for now, that's enough.\n\n \n You glance at Vincent, his wide eyes blinking behind those slightly crooked glasses, and decide not to dodge it this time.\n\n \"Okay,\" you say. \"If you've been hearing stuff... what exactly have you heard?\"\n\n He freezes, immediately flustered. \"Oh, uh—I mean, just—uh—stuff! General... hallway stuff. You know how it is, right?\"\n\n You give him a look.\n\n He shrinks slightly. \"Okay, okay, but just remember I'm not spreading anything. I'm just, uh... absorbing it. Like a sponge. A very, very awkward sponge who doesn't want to be involved.\"\n\n \"Vincent.\"\n\n \"Fine,\" he says, pressing his palms to his knees. \"Um... so, someone said you got pulled out of class because the principal found out you were... like, pretending to be trans? Which, uh, sucks, and is also clearly not how anything works.\"\n\n You nod slowly. He keeps going, albeit reluctantly.\n\n \"There's this girl in my French class and she said she overheard a TA say the school's putting you on a 'watch list.' It sounds fake but also kind of terrifying.\"\n\n It tracks, unfortunately.\n\n Vincent fidgets. \"And then today someone claimed you were gonna be expelled for using the girls' bathroom, which is just—insane. Like, you're just existing.\"\n\n \"I know,\" he says quickly. \"It's all nonsense. But it's spreading.\"\n\n He looks at you then, really looks, and his nervous energy drops for a moment.\n\n \"I'm sorry people are being like this. You didn't do anything wrong. Just... people don't like not understanding something. So they make up stories until it fits what they want.\"\n\n You let that hang in the air.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

It takes a few tries to find the right service corridor, but eventually, you spot the faded black double doors of the abandoned theater stairwell. It's technically condemned and officially off-limits, but absolutely Aurora's vibe.\n\nYou test the handle.\n\nLocked. Of course.\n\nBut someone's wedged a thin piece of rubber between the door and the frame. You pull, and it creaks open with the groan of a place that hasn't been acknowledged in Pacific Crest's budget in years.\n\nIt's dim inside. The only light leaks through the wired glass panes above, casting fractured golden beams down the stairwell. Dust hangs in the air. The walls are covered in peeling posters from long-forgotten plays, their edges curling like old leaves.\n\nYou step in carefully, bracing for the eerie silence abandoned places always carry.\n\nBut instead, you hear a voice.\n\nNot yours. Not Aurora's.\n\n\"But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun—\"\n\nYour foot scuffs against the step, and the voice cuts off.\n\nA figure sits on the mid-level landing of the stairwell, arms resting on his knees, script pages loose at his side.\n\nJordan.\n\n<<if [jordanRelo] > 29 or [d14jordanchoice1] isnot undefined>> \n You pause on the lower step, and he looks up. He's not startled though, just curious.\n\n There's a beat.\n\n Then he smirks. Just a little. \"You lost or stalking me?\"\n\n You roll your eyes. \"Can't it be both?\"\n\n Jordan exhales through his nose, amused. \"Fair.\"\n\n You step up a few more stairs until you're level with him, the fractured afternoon light cutting lines through the dusty walls and the edge of his strong jaw.\n\n \"I was actually looking for someone else,\" you admit. \"Aurora.\"\n\n He nods like that makes sense. \"Yeah, this place does scream 'mysterious goth girl energy.'\"\n\n He shifts over on the step without saying anything else—just enough to make room for you.\n\n You sit.\n\n It's quiet for a while. Just the echo of the school distant and faded, and Jordan's foot tapping absently.\n\n Then he says, without looking at you, \"People are talking.\"\n\n You glance at him. \"Trust me, I've noticed.\"\n\n \"They won't shut up about it.\" He tilts his head your way. \"You doing okay?\"\n\n You're still getting used to this version of Jordan—the one who asks things like that. But it's real. He's trying.\n\n You nod. \"It's certainly been a day.\"\n\n Jordan's quiet for a second longer, then pulls a crumpled script page from beside him and squints at it.\n\n \"I've been running the same two lines for a while now. Bennet's going to roast me alive if I fumble my lines tomorrow.\"\n\n You can't help but laugh.\n\n The quiet after feels... different now. Comfortable. Jordan doesn't fill it. He doesn't need to.\n\n He just lets it be.\n\n [Choice: Tell him what happened with the principal]\n [Choice: Ask if he's heard the rumors too]\n [Choice: Keep it light and talk about theater]\n [Choice: Ask him why he comes here]\n<<elseif [jordanRelo] > 14>> \n He looks up when he hears you—eyes sharp and jaw tight. Not surprised. Not exactly welcoming, either.\n\n \"...You lost?\" he asks flatly.\n\n You pause at the bottom step. \"No. Just looking for someone.\"\n\n He raises an eyebrow. \"Let me guess. It's Aurora.\"\n\n You nod.\n\n Jordan huffs, glancing off to the side. \"Figures. Everyone wants something from her lately.\"\n\n You're not sure what that means, but you let it go. The stairwell is heavy with dust and shadows, and Jordan doesn't move or gesture for you to sit. He stays exactly where he is—guarded and unreadable, like the steps themselves are off-limits unless you've earned them.\n\n \"I didn't think anyone used this place,\" you say after a few beats.\n\n \"I do.\" His tone is final. \"Usually alone.\"\n\n You stay standing. The silence teeters on the edge of tension.\n\n Then he says, still looking down at his script, \"People are talking about you. Pretty much everywhere.\"\n\n You nod once. \"Yeah. I noticed.\"\n\n He doesn't say anything else. He just drops the comment like a stone and lets it sit there between you.\n\n The air is cool and quiet.\n\n You've got a choice to make.\n\n [Choice: Tell him what happened with the principal]\n [Choice: Ask if he's heard the rumors too]\n [Choice: Keep it light and talk about theater]\n [Choice: Ask him why he comes here]\n\n \n He turns, slow and deliberate. His expression is irritated. Cold.\n\n You freeze. \"Uh. Sorry. I didn't know anyone was—\"\n\n \"You're not supposed to be here,\" Jordan says, voice flat. He's not angry, but his words are sharp enough to slice through whatever apology you were building in your throat.\n\n He doesn't stand. Doesn't offer a smile. He just watches you like you're a scene partner who came in late and then said the wrong line.\n\n \"I usually come here to be alone,\" he adds. \"To run lines. Think. Breathe. So unless you're here to fix the building or audition, maybe tell me why you're standing in my stairwell?\"\n\n It's not said cruelly, just with all the warmth of the Arctic.\n\n You stand at the bottom of the steps, the air thick with dust and judgment, trying to decide if it's worth trying to explain why you were really here.\n\n Because Jordan? Jordan doesn't do small talk.\n\n And he definitely doesn't do interruptions.\n\n [Choice: Apologize and leave]\n [Choice: Tell Jordan you're looking for Aurora]\n [Choice: Ask Jordan about the rumors]\n [Choice: Try to connect]",

His focus shifts entirely to you now—shoulders squared, the practiced poise of a quarterback and stage actor both gone still.\n\n \"What happened?\" he asks. There's no sarcasm or edge in his voice. He just listens.\n\n \"He said I'm being watched,\" you begin. \"That teachers are going to be reporting on me. My behavior, my... 'presentation.' Said I'm making people uncomfortable just by existing.\"\n\n Jordan's jaw tightens.\n\n You keep going. \"He didn't say I've broken any rules, because I haven't. But he made it clear that one slip, one incident, and he'll escalate it. File a report. Take it to the district. Kick me out if he can.\"\n\n For a second, Jordan doesn't say anything.\n\n Then he mutters, almost under his breath, \"Fucking hell.\"\n\n He leans forward, elbows on his knees, and rubs a hand over his face. When he looks back at you, his expression's harder. It's not at you though. It's for you.\n\n \"That's not discipline,\" he says. \"That's intimidation.\"\n\n He looks away for a beat, then right back. \"You tell anyone else?\"\n\n \"Luke and Samantha. Jessica kind of knows something's going on, because of course she does. Aurora probably knew before it even happened.\"\n\n Jordan snorts. \"Yeah. Sounds about right for Aurora.\"\n\n There's a silence—but it's not awkward. It's thoughtful.\n\n \"You shouldn't have to deal with this,\" he says quietly. \"You didn't ask for it.\"\n\n \"I really didn't ask to become a school-wide mystery, trust me.\"\n\n That earns the faintest curve of a smile from him.\n\n But it fades fast. He's still thinking.\n\n \"If he comes after you again, let me know,\" Jordan states firmly. \"I mean it.\"\n\n You blink. \"What would you do? Tackle him through the office wall?\"\n\n He shrugs. \"I don't have to tackle him. I'm the starting quarterback—this school treats the football team like royalty. Thompson's not gonna pick a fight with someone who brings in Friday night ticket sales.\"\n\n He pauses, then adds, \"If I speak up, it won't be easy for him to ignore. And I will, if I have to.\"\n\n You stare at him but Jordan doesn't back down.\n\n \"Look, [name], you're not alone in this,\" he adds, eyes back on yours. \"You never were.\"\n\n The light from the window catches the edge of his face, soft and gold. His voice is steady, but you can tell this cost him something to say. Vulnerability, even now, isn't easy for him.\n\n But he truly means it.\n\n And somehow, just for a moment, that makes it easier to breathe.\n \n \n You shift your weight against the railing, the old metal cool beneath your palm. Jordan's watching you now—script set aside, full and focused in that quiet, intense way of his.\n\n You take a breath. \"Have you heard any of it?\"\n\n He tilts his head slightly. \"The rumors?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you nod. \"I figured if you've heard them, then it's probably worse than I thought.\"\n\n He exhales through his nose. \"I've heard some. Locker room's been buzzing since lunch. And some of the theater kids, too—people talk more when they think you're not listening.\"\n\n You glance at him. \"And what are they saying?\"\n\n Jordan's jaw tightens for a second. He hesitates—not because he's unsure, but because he's debating how much to protect you from.\n\n \"Most of it's just... garbage,\" he says. \"Stupid shit. People trying to be funny, or edgy, or maybe both. One guy said you're going 'undercover' as a girl to ruin the football team's reputation.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"That's the plan. Spy mission. Expose the deep dark scandal of Pacific Crest High.\"\n\n That gets a short huff of a laugh from him—but it's brief.\n\n \"Others are asking if you're trans,\" he continues, his tone measured. \"Or pretending. or lying about something. A couple of people are saying you're unstable. That something's wrong with you.\"\n\n Your stomach turns, but you don't interrupt.\n\n Jordan watches your face, and when you don't say anything, he adds quietly, \"None of that matters to me, by the way.\"\n\n You glance at him.\n\n \"I mean it,\" he states. \"Let them talk. They're just trying to make sense of something they don't understand. It doesn't make them right. And it definitely doesn't mean they get to define who you are.\"\n\n You nod slowly. \"Still sucks.\"\n\n \"Yeah, it does,\" he responds, leaning back. \"I've corrected people. When I could. When it wouldn't blow things up worse. I figured you've got enough fires to put out right now.\"\n\n That hits a little harder than you expect.\n\n You look at him—really look—and for a second it's easy to forget that this is the guy who got mad at you at the mall.\n\n Now he's here. Watching your back and correcting people while not expecting anything in return.\n\n \"Thanks,\" you say.\n\n Jordan shrugs, like it's not a big deal. But the slight flush in his ears says otherwise.\n\n The dust swirls quietly in the stairwell and the silence, for once, feels like safety.\n \n \n You hover on the edge of saying something heavier. The words about Thompson, the rumors, the weight of it all—they sit right there in your throat, pressing, wanting to escape.\n\n But instead, you look at the crumpled script pages beside Jordan.\n\n \"So,\" you say, nudging your chin toward them. \"Still gunning for Romeo, huh?\"\n\n Jordan exhales, a faint smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. \"Obviously.\"\n\n \"Guess you're really trying to be a teenage heartthrob.\"\n\n Jordan chuckles as he leans back against the railing, expression easing. \"Mr. Bennet said I had 'raw presence.' I think that's code for 'you didn't completely butcher the balcony scene.'\"\n\n You laugh. \"That's high praise coming from him.\"\n\n Jordan shakes his head with a small grin. \"What about you? Considering Juliet?\"\n\n You shrug. \"Maybe I could. I like the idea of terrifying the PTA.\"\n\n That gets a real laugh out of him—short, low, and genuine. He lets it hang in the air for a moment, before glancing at you again, a little more serious now.\n\n \"You don't have to keep it casual, you know,\" he says. \"Not with me. Not anymore.\"\n\n You glance at him, caught off guard by the shift in his tone.\n\n \"I get it,\" he continues. \"You've got, like... a thousand people watching your every move right now. You don't owe me your trauma dump or whatever—but if you need to talk about it? You can.\"\n\n You don't say anything for a second. Just sit there in the dim stairwell, surrounded by peeling paint and dusty sunlight and a guy who's still kind of hard to read, but not as hard as he used to be.\n\n \"I appreciate that,\" you say quietly.\n\n Jordan shrugs like it's nothing.\n\n \"Yeah,\" he says, soft and sure.\n\n Then, he flips a page of his script and clears his throat. \"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to find the emotional core of a 14-year-old dumb enough to take dating advice from a priest.\"\n\n You grin. \"Let me know when you get there.\"\n\n He shoots you a look. \"Rude.\"\n\n You feel lighter. Just a little.\n \n \n You glance around the dim stairwell—there are dust motes floating in the sunlight and old posters peeling from the walls like forgotten ghosts. It smells like wood polish and history and a little bit like someone spilled Gladiraid in here once and never cleaned it up.\n\n Then you look at Jordan, still sitting next to you, idly folding the corner of his script. His brow's furrowed like he's stuck between lines—on the page or in his head, you're not sure.\n\n You hesitate before asking: \"Why here?\"\n\n He looks at you, puzzled. \"What?\"\n\n \"The stairwell. I mean... it's dusty. Abandoned. Probably cursed. Why come here?\"\n\n <<if [jordanRelo] > 49>> \n Jordan's face shifts, a slight flicker appearing behind the eyes. His fingers are still on the script corner. \"It's quiet.\"\n\n You wait, and after a beat, he sighs, leaning back against the rail with a dull thump.\n\n \"It's because no one looks for me here.\"\n\n His voice isn't bitter. It's just tired.\n\n \"At home, it's football,\" he states. \"Always. My dad's a coach. My brother played D1. My mom literally organizes half our booster events. If I'm not training, they think I'm slacking. If I'm not winning, I'm wasting time.\"\n\n You nod slowly.\n\n He rubs the back of his neck. \"Theater? It's a joke to them. A distraction. Something I 'do for fun.'\" He air quotes it, mouth tight. \"They don't get it. They don't want to get it. I swear, my dad once asked me if moving on stage would be good cardio.\"\n\n You snort. Jordan smiles, just a little. But it fades quickly.\n\n \"So I come here. Because no one checks. No coaches. No teammates. No parents. No... problems. Just a stairwell with decent acoustics and bad lighting but ton of space.\"\n\n You watch him, and for a moment, he doesn't look like the star quarterback or the brooding scene partner or the guy who always nails his lines. He just looks like someone who's tired of being told who to be.\n\n \"I don't mind being expected to show up,\" he says after a beat. \"I can handle being expected to perform. I just wish someone—anyone—ever asked what I actually care about. Why I choose to be here.\"\n\n A silence follows. It's heavy, but not in the awkward way. It's honest. Shared.\n\n You nod. \"I get that.\"\n\n Jordan looks over at you, something a little softer in his eyes now.\n\n \"Yeah,\" he says. \"I know you do.\"\n\n And somehow, in that quiet stairwell of cracked steps and shared pressure, you both understand each other just a little more.\n\n No spotlight. No whistle. Just space.\n \n \n Jordan gives a small shrug, eyes dropping back to the page. \"I dunno. It's quiet.\"\n\n You wait for him to say more but he doesn't. He instead just shifts a little, leaning back against the railing, thumb smoothing a crease in the corner of his script.\n\n You nod slowly, settling back against the wall. \"That's fair.\"\n\n The two of you sit there in the stillness, not really talking, not really needing to. Just existing in the same slightly dusty, weirdly peaceful space.\n \n \n\n [Choice: Continue]\n<<elseif [jordanRelo] > 14>> \n \n You shift on the step, the weight of the day settling heavier than it should. Jordan's flipping through the script like nothing's wrong, like you're not standing here with something clawing its way up your throat.\n\n Still, you speak.\n\n \"I got called into the principal's office today.\"\n\n He doesn't look up. Just pauses with his thumb pressed against the page edge.\n\n \"Thompson?\" he asks, voice flat.\n\n You nod. \"That's him.\"\n\n He finally glances at you, just for a second. He's not surprised. Not particularly concerned. Just... acknowledging.\n\n \"And?\"\n\n You take a breath. \"He said I'm under observation now. That I'm 'causing disruption.' Teachers are going to be reporting on me—how I act, how I dress, what people are saying. He didn't call it a threat, but it was.\"\n\n Jordan looks back at his script. \"Sounds like Thompson.\"\n\n \"That's it?\"\n\n He shrugs. \"He's a hardass. You're not the first person he's singled out.\"\n\n You wait for something else—a question, maybe, or even the smallest hint of sympathy.\n\n It doesn't come.\n\n \"He said if I mess up, he'll escalate it to the district,\" you add. \"Try to push me out.\"\n\n Jordan flips a page, slow and deliberate. \"Then I'd be careful if I were you.\"\n\n You blink. \"Geez. Thanks.\"\n\n He looks at you again, finally meeting your eyes—but it's distant. \"I'm not trying to be a dick. I'm just telling you how it is.\"\n\n \"Yeah. Got it.\"\n\n Jordan exhales, like the conversation is already over. \"Look. It sucks. But Thompson plays power games. He always has and he always will. You're just the new spotlight. That'll change eventually.\"\n\n And with that, he turns back to his script, like he's already written you out of the scene.\n\n You stand there for another second before stepping back, the echo of your own footsteps louder than anything he said.\n \n \n You stay standing, watching Jordan flip lazily through his script. He hasn't acknowledged you much, like your presence is ambient noise at best.\n\n So you ask, flatly, \"Have you heard the rumors?\"\n\n He doesn't look up.\n\n \"Tough to miss,\" he says, voice low and bored. \"They're everywhere.\"\n\n You nod once. \"Right.\"\n\n He finally turns a page. \"Locker rooms, lunch tables, group chats. Take your pick.\"\n\n There's no judgment in his tone—but no sympathy either. Just observation, delivered with an emotional distance.\n\n \"People are saying all kind of things,\" he adds. \"That you're faking something. That you're trying to prove a point. That you're on something. No one agrees, but that doesn't stop them.\"\n\n \"And what do you think?\" you ask, watching him carefully.\n\n Jordan shrugs. \"Doesn't matter what I think. Doesn't stop them talking.\"\n\n He finally glances at you again, just for a second. \"If you're expecting me to defend you or something, you're asking the wrong guy.\"\n\n You don't say anything and Jordan doesn't fill the silence.\n\n Eventually, he goes back to reading, flipping another page.\n\n \"Anyway,\" he mutters, \"good luck with all that.\"\n\n He speaks like that's the end of the conversation.\n\n And for him, it probably is.\n \n \n You stand there a little longer, the silence hanging heavy between the two of you. The air in the stairwell feels like it's waiting for something—an explanation, maybe a confrontation—but you're too tired for either.\n\n So you try to pivot.\n\n \"Still grinding for Romeo?\" you ask, nodding toward the crumpled pages at Jordan's side.\n\n Jordan doesn't even bother to look up. \"Obviously.\"\n\n You wait, hoping he might add something else. Instead, he just stares at the page like it personally offended him.\n\n You try again. \"You think Bennet's really gonna give it to you?\"\n\n Jordan finally glances up at you. \"I didn't ask,\" he states, tone clipped.\n\n You blink. \"Oh.\"\n\n \"Either I get it or I don't,\" he says, shrugging. \"It's not a group project. He's gonna cast whoever fits.\"\n \n \"That's fair,\" you say.\n\n Silence follows. He doesn't ask what role you're going for. Just goes back to his lines like you're background noise.\n\n You stand there for a few more seconds, then realize he's not going to say anything else. Not unless you push. And it's clear he doesn't want you to right now.\n\n So you let it go.\n \n \n You glance around the dim stairwell, the dusty light catching on old paint and peeling posters. Jordan hasn't said much since you walked in. He hasn't invited you to stay but hasn't told you to leave either.\n\n You shift your weight and ask, \"So... why do you come here anyway?\"\n\n Jordan doesn't look up from his script.\n\n There's a pause. Long enough that you start to think he's going to ignore your question entirely.\n\n Then, without looking at you, he mutters, \"That's none of your business.\"\n\n The words hit like a door being shut in your face—no anger, just indifference.\n\n You open your mouth, maybe to make a joke, but he doesn't follow up. Doesn't elaborate. Just turns another page with a slow flick and keeps reading like you're not even there anymore.\n\n Conversation over.\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n \n You stay frozen for a moment on the bottom step, one hand still resting on the rail. Jordan's gaze is flat as he waits for an answer you can't quite find.\n\n He doesn't look mad—just done. Like you walked into a room already occupied and brought nothing useful with you.\n\n You clear your throat. \"Sorry,\" you say, voice quiet. \"I didn't mean to bother you.\"\n\n You take a step back down the stairs. \"I was just... looking for someone else. I'll get out of your way.\"\n\n Jordan doesn't stop you. He just doesn't say anything for a beat before glancing down at his script. He mutters, \"Yeah. Probably a good idea.\"\n\n You nod, even though he isn't looking, and quietly pull the door shut behind you.\n\n The hallway outside feels colder than before.\n\n Quieter.\n\n Aurora's not here and you still don't know where the hell she is.\n \n \n You stay at the bottom of the stairs, your voice steady but careful. \"I'm not here to bother you. I was just looking for Aurora.\"\n\n Jordan lifts an eyebrow, but doesn't move from his seat. His legs stretch out over two steps like she owns them. \"She's not here.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I figured,\" you say, nodding. \"I just thought this might be one of her spots.\"\n\n He looks at you for a long moment—expression not friendly. It's not hostile, either. Just... distant.\n\n \"Look, [name], this isn't a place to go looking for people,\" he says finally. \"Most people come here to not be found.\"\n\n You shift on your feet, unsure if he's annoyed or just being blunt.\n\n Jordan sighs, running a hand through his hair like this whole conversation is dragging more energy out of him than it's worth. \"I'm not trying to be a dick. But if you're chasing rumors or drama, go somewhere else.\"\n\n \"I'm not.\"\n\n \"Then go be 'not' somewhere that isn't here.\"\n\n His words are firm.\n\n It's a wall. Not the type that's slammed in your face but the type that's just... set down between you. Clear and cold.\n\n You hesitate, then nod once.\n\n \"Got it.\"\n\n You turn and let the door close behind you, the stairwell dimming back into quiet.\n \n \n You glance sideways at him, testing the waters.\n\n \"So,\" you say slowly. \"I'm guessing you've heard the rumors too.\"\n\n Jordan doesn't look up from the script. He turns a page like you just asked him what time lunch starts.\n\n You wait for more.\n\n It doesn't come.\n\n After a second, you press. \"And... you don't care?\"\n\n He finally looks over at you, eyes unreadable. \"Should I?\"\n\n You blink. \"I mean, they're saying a lot. About me. About what I am. What I'm not. Some of it's pretty bad.\"\n\n \"High school's full of bored people with loud mouths,\" he says, shrugging. \"You think I have time to care about hallway gossip? I've got too much coming up.\"\n\n You frown. \"So you haven't... thought about it at all?\"\n\n He gives you a look. Not cruel, but definitely done. \"[name]. You either let people talk, or you spend your life trying to control what they say. Guess which one gets you through the day faster.\"\n\n You feel your stomach tighten, but you say nothing.\n\n Jordan goes back to his script like the conversation never happened. A few seconds pass before he adds, almost as an afterthought, \"Close the door on your way out. Draft's annoying.\"\n\n And just like that, you're dismissed.\n \n \n You hesitate at the bottom of the stairs, then slowly step up one, then another, trying not to make too much noise. Jordan doesn't look up again, just picks at a corner of one of his script pages.\n\n You try anyway.\n\n \"I didn't know you came here,\" you say, trying to sound casual. \"Theater stairwell's kind of a weird spot for a quarterback.\"\n\n Jordan doesn't laugh. He doesn't even smirk. Just mutters, \"Yeah, well. Weird spots for weird times.\"\n\n You take another step. \"Do you come here a lot? Like, to run lines, or just... get away?\"\n\n He finally looks at you, and there's no sharpness in his gaze. But it's cold. Blank. A wall so well-rehearsed it might as well be made of brick.\n\n \"I come here,\" he says, flatly, \"to be alone.\"\n\n You blink. \"Right. I just thought—\"\n\n \"You didn't think,\" he cuts in, standing slowly and brushing dust off his varsity jacket. \"Or maybe you did, but either way, it's not your space.\"\n\n You pause. \"I wasn't trying to bother you. I just figured we could—\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" he interrupts again, voice sharper now. \"But I didn't ask for that. And I don't owe you anything either.\"\n\n The stairwell feels colder now.\n\n Jordan turns his back and sits down again, adjusting his notes like you're already gone.\n\n You stay for one more breath. Maybe even two.\n\n Then you nod and step back down the stairs. You leave the door open just a crack behind you. But Jordan doesn't follow.\n \n\n [Choice: Go back to the courtyard]",

He's leaned back, his script long forgotten on the step between you, and he's been glancing over at you every so often—not because he's waiting for you to say something, but because he wants to make sure you're okay.\n\n Eventually, you sigh and shift to stand. \"As much as I hate to do this, I should honestly get going. Still trying to track down Aurora.\"\n\n \"You sure you're good?\" Jordan asks, sitting up from his slouch.\n\n You nod, hesitating just a beat too long. \"Yeah. I mean... not really. But yeah.\"\n\n He gives you this look you can't quite describe. Gentle but steady. Like he cares, but doesn't know how to express it that well.\n\n \"Hey. You don't have to do the 'I'm fine' thing with me.\"\n\n You smile, just a little. \"I know.\"\n\n Jordan reaches out and gives your arm a brief, reassuring squeeze—just firm enough to be grounding. \"If you ever need to talk. Actually talk. I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\n You meet his eyes—and for a second, the whole stairwell goes still. Because this isn't the Jordan who used to barely look at you in class. This isn't the Jordan who kept everyone at arm's length, locked behind walls and cool stares. And this definitely isn't the Jordan who got mad at the mall.\n\n This is him, making the conscious choice to show up. For you. He's looking at you like you matter. He wants you to be okay.\n\n Letting you in doesn't scare him the way it used to, and that lands harder than anything else today.\n\n You nod. \"Thanks. Really.\"\n\n He tries to smile—it's small and a little crooked, like he's still figuring out how. He hasn't smiled much, but he's trying. Maybe just for you.\n\n \"Besides, someone's gotta make sure you don't get hexed into a guinea pig while chasing the school witch.\"\n\n You snort. If only he knew. \"If she turns me into a guinea pig, I hope at least it's one of the cute ones.\"\n\n You finally stand and head toward the door, but before you push it open, you hear him call out behind you.\n\n \"[name].\"\n\n You glance back.\n\n He's watching you, leaning forward on his knees, expression a little softer.\n\n \"Don't let this place change you into someone you're not.\"\n\n You nod and slip out of the stairwell, the door clicking shut behind you, feeling more like yourself again.\n<<elseif [jordanRelo] > 29 or [d14jordanchoice1] isnot undefined>> \n The silence between you and Jordan has settled into something easier now—not exactly comfortable, but certainly familiar in its own way. He's flipping through his script with one hand, the other resting casually against his knee. Every so often, he glances at you, like he's checking to see if you're still there.\n\n Eventually, you shift and glance toward the stairwell door. \"I should probably get moving. Still trying to track down Aurora.\"\n\n Jordan closes his script and rests it on his thigh. \"She's not exactly the easiest person to find.\"\n\n \"That's kind of her brand, isn't it?\"\n\n He gives a faint, amused breath—almost a laugh. \"You good, though?\"\n\n You look at him. He's not pushing. He's just asking.\n\n \"Getting there.\"\n\n Jordan nods back. \"Let me know if you need anything. Or, I don't know... moral support. Vaguely threatening stares in Thompson's direction.\"\n\n You smirk. \"Noted.\"\n\n He shifts slightly, leaning back against the wall again, looking more relaxed than when you first found him.\n\n \"Good luck finding her,\" he says, tone softer. \"She usually shows up when she wants to.\"\n\n You stand and offer him a small smile. \"Thanks.\"\n\n \"See you in theater,\" he says, already flipping back to his script.\n\n You head down the stairs, feeling the weight of the day just a little lighter behind you. Jordan doesn't say anything else.\n\n But when you look back one last time, he's watching you go.\n\n \n The silence stretches, heavy and stale like the air here. Jordan continues flipping through his script as if you're not even there.\n\n You clear your throat. \"I should get going. Still looking for Aurora.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" he says, eyes still on the script. \"Probably a better use of your time.\"\n\n You wait, maybe even hope, for anything else—a nod, a glance, even the barest flicker of acknowledgment.\n\n Nothing.\n\n \"See you around, I guess,\" you say.\n\n Jordan doesn't answer.\n\n You turn and head back down the steps, each footfall louder than it should be. The air feels colder on the way out than it did going in.\n\n You don't look back. What would the point be? He never does.\n \n\n[Choice: Go back to the courtyard]",

Not even that one you got from the fundraiser? The pastel one with the number that makes no sense?\"\n\n You shrug. \"Didn't feel like it.\"\n\n Luke clutches his chest like he's been stabbed. \"You, [name], had the chance to be loud and show off team spirit, and you passed it up? On Jersey Day?

The desks are pushed into a big rectangle in the center of the room, like an academic summoning circle.\n\n<<if [vincentRelo] > 19>> \n You slip into the seat beside Vincent, who's already mid-flip through a tattered prep guide labeled \"REGIONAL INVITATION.\" The binding is cracked and several pages are missing. There's a margin doodle of Obama dabbing. This thing must be ancient.\n\n \"[name]!\" he says, sitting bolt upright like you just saved his life. \"Good. Great. You're here. This is good.\"\n\n \n You scan the room—every seat's taken except for the one next to Vincent, who's hunched over a battered prep guide labeled \"REGIONAL INVITATION.\" The spine is crumbling, and a corner of the cover is held together with clear desperation. There's a margin doodle of Obama dabbing. This thing must be ancient.\n\n You drop your bag beside him and sit down. He doesn't look up.\n\n Just keeps flipping pages, writing something in his impeccably neat handwriting.\n\n You clear your throat. Nothing.\n\n Alright then.\n \n\nMax suddenly storms in—tall, wiry, dramatic as always. He drops his bag with a whump, kicks it under the desk, and slaps a beat-up whiteboard onto the nearest surface.\n\n\"Alright, nerds and nerd-adjacent allies,\" he announces. \"Welcome to Round Two of Operation: Finally Beat Riverview High and Make Them Cry.\"\n\nVincent mutters, \"They don't even cry, that's the worst part. They just smirk condescendingly.\"\n\n\"That's even worse!\" Max shouts, scribbling on the whiteboard. \"This year, we're qualifying. That means we prep for the Regional Academic Invitational—aka the Super Bowl for people who alphabetize their bookshelves.\"\n\nHe draws six categories on the board: Math, Literature, Science, History, Current Events, and Logic Puzzles. Then he caps the marker with some dramatic flair.\n\n\"We've got six categories and a little under two weeks to not suck. So we're splitting into pairs for practice. Vincent—you're on Science with [name].\"\n\nVincent blinks. Once. Twice. \"...Just science? Not even, like, light history on the side.\"\n\n\"Yup,\" Max says cheerfully. \"Raw, uncut, organic chemistry-flavored suffering.\"\n\nVincent clutches the edge of the desk. \"I once cried during a physics test.\"\n\n\"Then this is your redemption arc,\" Max says solemnly. \"You are the Zuko of this team now.\"\n\nBefore Vincent can say anything else, Max continues announcing assignments and scribbling pairs on the whiteboard.\n\nVincent glances sideways at you, looking panicked. \"Okay, okay, I technically got straight As in my science courses. But it was through sheer force of will and unhealthy levels of caffeine. I hated every second of it.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"So you're saying you're traumatized.\"\n\nHe nods solemnly. \"I still flinch when I hear the word 'lab report.'\"\n\nMax slams a packet onto your desk, full of practice questions. \"Five rounds. Fifteen questions. Buzz in or perish.\"\n\nVincent flinches.\n\nYou flip open the packet. The first question is about kinetic energy. The second includes a diagram of a cow on roller skates going down a hill.\n\n\"Okay,\" you mutter. \"Let's do this.\"\n\nVincent mumbles, \"Please don't let me be the weak link.\"\n\nMax throws a piece of chalk like a baton. \"Avengers assemble!\"\n\nVincent catches it and immediately drops it.\n\n[Choice: Jump straight into it]\n[Choice: Make a nerdy joke to ease the tension]",

What is its acceleration?\n\n Easy.\n\n You barely blink, solving it in your head.\n\n You buzz in, calm and confident. \"Four meters per second squared.\"\n\n Vincent looks at you, eyebrows raised slightly—not shocked, but... impressed. He double-checks his notes, then nods once.\n\n Max, from the front, slaps the desk like you just scored a touchdown. \"Boom! And we're off to a strong start. [name], my guy, you may yet carry us to academic Valhalla.\"\n\n You smirk, flipping to the next page.\n\n Bring it on.\n \n \n You crack open the packet with the kind of confidence that only lasts about five seconds.\n\n Question 1: A 5kg object is pushed with a force of 20N across a frictionless surface. What is its acceleration?\n\n You blink.\n\n You know those words individually. You even remember what Newton's Second Law is... probably. You think it's the one about apples? No—force equals mass times acceleration. Or something like that. Maybe.\n\n Vincent is already scribbling formulas on his notepad with the intensity of someone defusing a bomb. You glance at him, then back at the question, and write the number 5 next to a doodle of a stick figure falling over.\n\n It's... something.\n\n You buzz in anyway.\n\n Vincent slowly turns his head toward you like he just witnessed someone commit a crime against academia.\n\n \"Seven,\" you say, absolutely guessing.\n\n Vincent doesn't respond for a moment. Then, in a whisper, \"...meters per second squared.\"\n\n You nod slowly, pen hovering. \"Right. That's what I meant.\"\n\n Max groans from the front of the room. \"We are going to die at regionals.\"\n \n\n \n <<if [study] > 84>> \n \n You glance at Vincent, who's staring at the first question. His pencil taps against the desk in a steady, anxious rhythm.\n\n You nudge your packet slightly toward him. \"You know, statistically speaking, if we both panic at the same time, we create a quantum superposition of failure.\"\n\n Vincent snorts, just once. \"That doesn't even make sense.\"\n\n You grin. \"Sure it does. Observer effect: if no one sees us bomb the quiz, did we really bomb it?\"\n\n He groans, but he's smiling now—just barely. \"Okay, that one was actually good. I'll give you that. Annoying, sure. But good.\"\n\n You smirk. \"I contain multitudes.\"\n\n And just like that, he's sitting a little straighter. Pencil tapping slowed. Eyes a little clearer.\n\n Science might not be his thing. But maybe you can be.\n \n \n You glance at Vincent, who's gripping his pencil like it personally wronged him, and you can practically see the anxiety radiating off his shoulders. You figure a little humor to cut the tension would be nice.\n\n You clear your throat dramatically. \"So... if we fail this packet hard enough, do we collapse into a black hole of ignorance, or do we just respawn in summer school?\"\n\n Vincent pauses, but you? You press on.\n\n \"Like, if Newton saw how bad I am at this, would he still invent gravity, or would he just—float away out of shame?\"\n\n Vincent blinks at you.\n\n Then groans. \"That didn't even have a punchline.\"\n\n You grin. \"You're welcome.\"\n\n He doesn't say anything, but the slight shake of his head as he turns back to the packet says it all: you've made it worse.\n\n But hey—at least now he's distracted.\n\n Kind of.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Jump straight into it]",

The packet sits between you, half-filled, smudged with graphite and pride. You may just have crushed it.\n\n Vincent adjusts his glasses and double-checks one of the later questions. \"Okay. I was definitely guessing on the molecular orbital diagram... but I think I guessed correctly?\"\n\n You glance at your copy. \"You did. I cross-referenced the electron configuration and didn't see any errors. You're good.\"\n\n He blinks at you. \"Seriously?\"\n\n You nod. \"Seriously.\"\n\n Vincent stares at his page like it might start applauding. \"I... think I'm going to cry a little.\"\n\n Max strolls by, flipping through your packet. He lets out a low whistle. \"Hot damn. This is the kind of packet you print out and slap on the fridge next to a Nobel Prize.\"\n\n You smirk. \"We have our moments.\"\n\n Max tosses the packet back on the desk like he's afraid it'll catch on fire. \"If we don't qualify this year, I'm filing a grievance with the universe.\"\n\n Vincent sits up straighter, his usual awkward energy replaced by something almost, just almost, resembling confidence. \"You know, maybe science isn't entirely evil.\"\n\n And just like that, you're pretty sure this team might actually have a shot.\n\n \n You and Vincent sit in absolute silence, staring down at the wreckage of your completed science packet like it's the aftermath of a natural disaster. A disaster you were somehow responsible for.\n\n Vincent's glasses have slid halfway down his nose. His once-neat handwriting devolved into frantic scribbles and something that might just be Morse code. You're pretty sure one of your answers involved a cow achieving escape velocity.\n\n Max walks past your desk, picks up the packet, flips through the first page, and then slowly lowers it.\n\n \"Wow,\" he says softly. \"This is... incredible.\"\n\n You look up. \"Really?\"\n\n \"No,\" Max says. \"But you did spell 'molecule' with a 'k,' and honestly? I respect it.\"\n\n Vincent groans, face in his hands. \"I blanked so hard I forgot how mass works.\"\n\n Max cackles. \"Okay, new plan. One of you studies, the other one just distracts the Riverview team with chaotic energy.\"\n\n You and Vincent look at each other.\n\n You both know which one you are.\n\n Still, Max claps you on the shoulder. \"It's not the worst round we've ever had. That title goes to the year someone confused Darwin with Da Vinci and said the Mona Lisa evolved.\"\n\n You blink. \"Okay, that's—\"\n\n \"Me,\" Max admits. \"That was me.

He stretches his arms overhead like he just finished digging a trench, not leading a study session. \"Alright, scholars of Pacific Crest...

You're letting us stop without a timed buzzer round?\"\n\n\"Come on, even I know when to give the brain a break,\" Max says, rifling through his backpack. \"And today, that break comes in the form of tabletop escapism.\"\n\nYou blink. \"What, like Uno?\"\n\nMax looks personally offended. \"No. Like Dungeons & Dragons, my sweet summer child.\"\n\nFrom the abyss of his overstuffed bag, Max pulls out a beat-up Dungeon Master's Guide, a pouch of dice, and a stack of pre-generated character sheets, many of which have scribbled notes.\n\nVincent immediately perks up. \"Wait, we're really doing this when the Regional Academic Invitational is coming up soon? Like... an actual campaign?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's real, alright,\" Max says, setting up behind the desk in the center. \"I'm talking a full questline with dangerous decisions and exhilarating combat.\"\n\nYou glance around at the rest of the club.

Binder held today with duct tape, stickers, and possibly magic. Then he clears his throat and launches in.\n\n\"The Realm of Xasnium has stood in a fragile balance for nearly seven decades. The last great war is fading from memory. Kingdoms broker peace with shaky hands. Magic, once controlled, now flickers at the edges of the world like a match near kindling.\"\n\nHe pauses, eyes scanning the table, making sure you're all focused.\n\n\"But that peace is cracking.\"\n\nHis hand moves to the map on the desk—a hand-drawn parchment of coastlines, forest, and cities.\n\n\"Rumors spread from the shadowed east. Temples closing their doors. Stars disappearing from the night sky. And whispers... whispers of an ancient text long thought destroyed—The Feror Script. A tome that does not teach spells, but rewrites them.\"\n\nHe lets the silence settle.\n\n\"You do not begin as heroes. Not yet, at least. You are strangers. Mercenaries. Scholars. Survivors. But you have heard the same name echo from a dozen mouths in a dozen dying towns: Ofren. A city where something is waking up.\"\n\nMax looks up, eyes steady.\n\n\"Your journey begins at dusk. A caravan is just outside the city walls of Ofren, taking you and a few others into a place the world has tried—and failed—to forget.\"\n\nHe sets the scene, voice dangerous.\n\n\"The sky is red. The wind is sharp. And Ofren waits.\"\n\nHe turns to you.\n\n \n \"[name]. Your wizard arrives with the caravan. What does the world see when you step down from the cart?\"\n\n You glance down at your character sheet, then sit up a little straighter.\n\n The moment Max gives the cue, you take a breath, summoning the dramatic spirit of the great poets of history.\n\n Then you begin:\n\n \"I step down slow, with a boot full of sand,\n A book on my back, and a plan in my hand.\n They call me Rhombulus—the Rhymer, that's right,\n My spells are in stanza, and my scrolls? Pure spite.\"\n\n Vincent has to stop himself from laughing. Someone at the far end of the table mutters, \"No way this is real.\"\n\n You keep going, eyes fixed on Max.\n\n \"I once lit an orc on fire with verse,\n and healed a queen's sprain with a half-written curse.\n I don't deal in whispers—I cast when I speak\n I rhyme in my sleep and I rhyme when I sneak.\"\n\n Max raises an eyebrow. \"Do you rhyme even in combat, Rhombulus?\"\n\n \"If I must—then prepare for a thrill,\n It's how I survived... and how I still will.\"\n\n Max leans back. He's clearly impressed but doing his best to look impartial.\n\n \"Alright, Rhombulus,\" he says. \"Your boots hit the earth just outside Ofren's gate. The air is dry. The city looms ahead. You feel it in your bones: something isn't right.\"\n\n He glances around the table. \n \"The rest of you arrive soon after. But for now... Rhombulus stands alone.\"\n\n And just like that, the campaign has begun.\n\n Max leans forward behind the DM screen, his fingers steepled, eyes sharp.\n\n \"The dirt road winds beneath Rhombulus' boots, cracked and dry under the fading sun. Ahead, Ofren looms—its stone walls blotting out the light, its gate half open. The air tastes of metal and ash.\"\n\n \"To your left: a wooden post, covered in torn notices and hastily scribbled warnings. To your right: a narrow footpath that dips into a shadowed grove. Behind you: the creaking caravan pulling away without a second glance.\"\n\n Max lifts his gaze to you.\n\n \"Rhombulus stands at the edge of the unknown. What do you do, lone poet of arcane tone?\"\n\n The table goes quiet.\n\n It's your turn to let Rhombulus act.\n\n \n \"[name]. Your bard arrives with the caravan. What does the world see when you step down from the cart?\"\n\n You glance down at your character sheet.\n\n Radarys the Resonant. Bard. No formal training. Proficient in Kazoo.

You raise an imaginary instrument to your lips and make a noise that is half kazoo, half air horn, and fully cursed.\n\n \"BWAAAAHP.\"\n\n Vincent chokes on his water.\n\n You stand in the spotlight of your own delusion and begin your character's entrance monologue with full confidence.\n\n \"I arrive in a burst of wind and musical genius. My name is Radarys. Bard and wanderer. I am the chosen one of the ancient windpipe gods, and my kazoo is my sword.\"\n\n Max doesn't stop you. He knows better.\n\n You keep going.\n\n \"I don't cast spells. I unleash them. Through pure, vibrating plastic.\"\n\n You raise the nonexistence kazoo again and BWAAP like it's your war horn.\n\n \"You see, the gods didn't give me a lute. They gave me something better. A kazoo with destiny and questionable acoustics.\"\n\n Max leans slightly over the DM screen, eyes narrowed. \"So... you're not playing music?\"\n\n You hold up a hand dramatically.\n\n \"Music plays me.\"\n\n You reach into thin air and mime polishing your nonexistent kazoo.\n\n \"The wind speaks and I answer through spit and vibration.\"\n\n Someone down the table whispers, \"There's no way this is allowed in the rules.\"\n\n You stare them down.\n\n \"Rules are for instruments that tune. The kazoo? It chooses.\"\n\n Max lets the silence sit for a beat.\n\n Then he exhales and flips a page in his binder. \"Alright, Radarys steps down from the cart. The city of Ofren looms. The wind dies. The streets are too quiet. You hear your own footsteps echo—almost like they're in tune with something. Faint. Reedy. Nasal.\"\n\n He doesn't say the word, but you know that it's kazoo energy.\n\n Max continues.\n\n \"To your left: a notice board full of ominous postings. To your right: a shadowed grove. And ahead... a city with no music. What does Radarys do?\"\n\n You raise the kazoo one more time, full of unearned gravitas.\n\n \"I walk toward Ofren. I bring sound. I bring truth. I bring... buzz.\"\n\n BWAAAAAP.\n\n \n Max turns slowly, eyes gleaming with anticipation.\n\n \"[name]. Your paladin arrives with the caravan.

Max gestures for you to continue.\n\n \"I survey the land not for battle, but for potential friendships. I adjust my armor, which squeaks because it's not broken in yet. And when I step down onto the dirt road, I pause to name a small rock by my boot. Gregory.\"\n\n Max bites his lip, trying to suppress a smile. \"And what does Sir Cedric do next?\"\n\n \"I vow to protect all who cannot protect themselves: the weak, the innocent, and those who have been cruelly overlooked by fate, like that poor lonely flower over there. I swear I'll write it a poem later.\"\n\n Vincent mutters, \"Oh God, he's going to end up hugging a demon, isn't he?\"\n\n Max leans into the world-building.\n\n \"The wind blows sharp from the east. You see the city of Ofren ahead—its gates half-open, as if caught between welcome and warning. The caravan behind you rolls on, leaving dust in its wake. To your left: a weathered notice board. To your right: a grove shadowed by gnarled trees. Ahead: the city, still and waiting.\"\n\n Max looks up.\n\n \"Sir Cedric stands at the edge of Ofren. What do you do?\"\n\n You square your shoulders and raise an invisible sword reverently.\n\n \"I take a deep breath and whisper a prayer to the god of kindness and conflict resolution.

They're all changed and stretching, laughing and talking in several circles.\n\nYou slow your pace a little, heart thudding, and scan the group.\n\nJessica stands at the center, arms crossed, her polished smile slipping just a little at the edges. She's dressed perfectly, as always. From the crisp white sneakers to the flawless maroon hairtie. She's pretending to be relaxed, tapping idly at her phone like none of this matters, but you catch the slight tension in her body.\n\nMia lounges nearby, tugging casually at the hem of her skirt and smirking at something only she seems to find funny. She catches you looking and winks like she's the star of a show.\n\nAshley, leaning back on her hands in the grass, looks almost bored. She pops a stick of gum into her mouth without a second thought, stretching her legs out in front of her.\n\nMeanwhile, Tori hums a weird tune to herself as she adjusts her braid. She's wearing mismatched scrunchies on both arms and chattering to no one in particular about how she's definitely going to stick her landing this time.\n\nYou hover awkwardly at the edge, still in your regular clothes. The sound of your sneakers crunching against the turf finally draws Jessica's attention.\n\n\"There you are,\" she says, flashing you a bright, albeit shaky smile. \"Okay, quick announcement before we start—\" She claps her hands to get everyone's attention. Mia rolls her eyes but listens. Ashley just raises an eyebrow. Tori salutes.\n\nJessica clears her throat. \"This Friday is the Homecoming Day game,\" she says, her voice practiced. \"Which means our halftime routine has to be perfect. No, absolutely flawless.\"\n\nTori bounces slightly on her toes, her bracelets jangling. \"Ooh, pressure! I love it!\" she chirps.\n\nMia tosses her curly red hair over her shoulder lazily. \"We'll be fine,\" she says. \"We'll crush it, just like always. People won't even be watching us much anyway. They'll all be drooling over Jordan.\"\n\nAshley blows a small bubble with her gum. \"Speak for yourself. I'm just here for the vibe.\"\n\nJessica ignores them all. \"We have to nail every count. Stunts, formation, energy. All of it. I mean it.\"\n\nShe meets your eyes briefly.\n\nYou nod once.\n\nJessica exhales through her nose. \"Alright. Let's warm up everyone. [name], get changed and meet us on the mats. Your uniform is in the locker room.\"\n\nShe flashes one last smile before turning to direct everyone through a warm-up sequence.\n\nYou head toward the locker room, the knot of nerves tightening just a little more in your stomach.\n\nHomecoming.\n\nNo pressure at all.\n\n[Choice: Go change]",

Ashley's casual and unbothered, while Tori grins wide and gives you a little finger-gun as you approach.\n\n\"First thing's first—warm-ups,\" Jessica announces. \"High knees, butt kicks, jumping jacks. Let's go!\"\n\nYou fall right into step with the others, and the next few minutes blur by as your heart pounds.\n\nOnce warm-ups are done, Jessica blows her whistle, pulling everyone into a loose circle.\n\n\"Today we're going to be working on stunts,\" she says, tapping the clipboard she's somehow produced out of thin air. \"Homecoming's going to have a huge crowd, even bigger than the first game of the season.

You're going to prove yourself today—show Jessica you're not just here to fill out the squad. You belong here.\n\n When Jessica claps her hands to start the first stunt sequence, you launch into motion. This time, everything clicks.\n\n You hit your marks with sharp precision, muscles moving like they already know what to do before you think about it. Every jump, every catch, every shift of weight—it all feels so damn right. When you step in to spot, your hands are exactly where they need to be, steady and confident. You power through the lifts, instinctively adjusting whenever someone wobbles.\n\n Out of the corner, you catch Jessica watching you. Really watching you. Her clipboard droops a little in her hand, her eyes wide for half a second before she forces her expression back. You can notice the grin she's fighting, though.\n\n When the routine ends and Jessica blows her whistle to pause the group, her voice is almost breathless with excitement. \"[name], that was amazing!\" she says, stepping toward you, the sun catching the gold in her hair as she smiles—really smiles—at you. \"You nailed it. Seriously.\"\n\n You rub the back of your neck, feeling a little sheepish under the sudden attention. \"Uh, thanks. I'm just.. trying to keep up.\"\n\n Jessica laughs, light and warm. \"You're not just keeping up,\" she says, patting your shoulder lightly. \"You're making the rest of us look bad.\"\n\n Mia lets out a low whistle under her breath. Ashley nods with an approving smirk. Tori practically bounces in place, clapping. \"[name], that was so cool! You're like a human trampoline!\"\n\n Jessica shakes her head, her eyes still on you. \"Seriously, keep this up and you're going to make Homecoming look insane.\"\n\n You can't help but grin, chest swelling with something warm. You feel like you belong. And judging by the way Jessica's still smiling at you even after she calls everyone back to formation, you know she's starting to think so too.\n \n \n <<if [jessicaRomance] > 9>> \n You plant your feet on the mat, heart thudding, determination buzzing under your skin. No holding back today. You are going to nail this practice. You're going to show Jessica that you're serious about this.\n\n When Jessica claps her hands to start the first stunt sequence, you spring forward with way more energy than precision. You charge into the lift too early, nearly knocking over Ashley, who side-steps you with a startled laugh. When it's your turn to spot, you throw up your hands way too late and end up lunging forward and skidding awkwardly across the mat.\n\n Mia bursts out laughing immediately. \"Smooth, Casanova,\" she snickers, shaking her head.\n\n Jessica covers her mouth, trying—and failing—not to laugh. There's a sparkle in her eyes, and when she finally lowers her hand, she's smiling in a way that's half amused, half... something warmer.\n\n \"Well, points for enthusiasm,\" she says, voice light. She taps her clipboard lightly against her leg, the corners of her mouth twitching up. \"Honestly? That was kind of adorable.\"\n\n You scramble upright, cheeks burning, trying to brush it off with a crooked grin. \"Just, you know... adding a little flair.\"\n\n Tori claps gleefully like you've just pulled off a full acrobatic routine. \"That was, like, the cutest almost-faceplant I've ever seen!\"\n\n Jessica shakes her head, still smiling, her voice a little softer when she peaks again. \"Okay, okay—let's reset and take it from the top. And maybe this time, [name], less flair?\"\n\n She flashes you a look that's half challenge, half inside joke, and your chest gives you a stupid little flutter you pretend not to notice.\n\n You jog back into position. You're messing up, sure—but you can feel something in your muscles, under the clumsiness. The raw instinct is there, just waiting to click into place. And judging. by the way Jessica keeps sneaking glances your way, you're clearly doing something right.\n \n \n You plant your feet on the mat, heart thudding as you try to hype yourself up. No playing it safe today. You are going to crush this practice. You're going to prove you're more than the weird extra body Jessica roped into this mess.\n\n When Jessica claps her hands to start the first stunt sequence, you spring into action with all the enthusiasm in the world.\n\n Unfortunately, enthusiasm isn't quite enough.\n\n You charge into the first lift far too early, nearly knocking over Ashley, who catches herself with a startled laugh. When it's your turn to spot, you throw up your hands way too late and end up lunging forward and skidding awkwardly across the mat.\n\n Mia snorts loudly from across the circle. \"Graceful,\" she says under her breath, tossing her hair in mock pity.\n\n Jessica pinches the bridge of her nose like she's summoning every ounce of patience in her body. \"Good energy, [name],\" she says in a strained voice. \"Let's just... focus on timing next time, okay?\"\n\n You scramble upright, cheeks burning, trying to laugh it off. \"Yeah, of course. It was all part of the plan. Totally.\"\n\n Tori, bless her, claps for you like you just won a gold medal. \"Ten outta ten for commitment!\" she cheers.\n\n Despite yourself, you can feel the natural rhythm of the routine clicking somewhere underneath all your flailing. Your body wants to get it right—you can feel it in your bones, in the way your muscles seem to hum with potential. It's like your instincts are way ahead of your coordination.\n\n \"Alright,\" Jessica says with a tight smile. \"Let's reset. From the top. And this time... maybe don't tackle your teammates.\"\n\n The squad laughs, and you force yourself to smile as you settle back into position. You're definitely making a fool of yourself—but for some reason, it doesn't feel quite so terrible.\n\n Maybe because, deep down, you know you're only just getting started.\n \n \n\n \n \n You plant your feet carefully on the mat, taking a steady breath as you watch Jessica run through the formation. The others are buzzing with energy, but you focus inward.\n\n No showing off and no crazy stunts. You just want to get through this clean.\n\n When Jessica claps her hands to start, you move into position, concentrating hard on every step and lift. You keep your motions tight and your timing sharp, even if you don't add anything flashy. You focus on sticking the landings, spotting the flyers, and being exactly where you're supposed to be.\n\n It's not glamorous, but it's solid.\n\n When the stunt sequence wraps up, you catch Jessica nodding to herself, making a quick note on her clipboard. She looks up, meets your eyes briefly, and gives you a small, approving smile. It's not the dazzled kind, but the kind that says \"I see you.\"\n\n \"Good work, [name],\" she says as she circles past you. \"Clean. Keep that up.\"\n\n You feel a small swell of pride, even if it's not the most exciting praise. It's better this way. You're showing you're a member of the squad that can be trusted. That you're not going to mess around and cause chaos on the field—especially not with Homecoming breathing down everyone's neck.\n\n Mia looks vaguely impressed, Tori gives you a double thumbs-up, and Ashley tosses you a casual nod.\n\n You reset your stance and shake out your arms. You've made solid, steady progress. And for today, that's enough.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Her ponytail swings behind her with every step.\n\n\"Alright!\" she calls, clapping her hands together. \"We're going to break into pairs and work through tumbling passes and sideline choreography! Spirit, not chaos, alright?\n\nThere's a collective shuffle as people look around, pairing almost immediately. Ashley with Tori, a few of the other girls linking up without needing to be asked. You're still stretching, scanning for someone to pair with, when you feel a sharp tap on your shoulder.\n\nYou spin around and find Mia standing there, smirking like she's been planning this all along. She's adjusting the hem of her shirt, posture loose and lazy, every movement dripping with smug confidence.\n\n\"Guess you're stuck with me, superstar,\" she says, cocking her head and flashing a sly, challenging smile.\n\nYou lift a brow, matching her energy. \"Hope you can keep up.\"\n\nMia chuckles, low and amused, like she already knows something you don't. \"Cute,\" she says easily, nudging your arm as she saunters past you to take her place on the mat, tossing a look over her shoulder that dares you to keep up.\n\n\"Each pair will run the standard sideline cheer sequence. We'll rotate who leads halfway through. Remember: the crowd watches your faces as much as your arms. You should be able to sell our boring chant like it's the most exciting thing on the planet.\"\n\nTori immediately starts waving her arms around like an inflatable tube man. Jessica ignores her.\n\n\"Alright, let's go!\" she calls, stepping back to supervise.\n\nMia cracks her knuckles exaggeratedly and flashes you a mischievous look. \"Ready to get humiliated? I've been doing sideline cheers since middle school.\"\n\nYou roll your eyes, but move into position across from her. The two of you mirror each other, feet shoulder-width apart, hands by your sides.\n\nJessica calls out the first cheer, and you both jump into motion. The rhythm pounds into your muscles—step, clap, punch, jump. It's fast, repetitive, and meant to be high-energy, but requiring ridiculous precision. You focus hard on hitting every movement at the right beat.\n\nSurprisingly, you find your rhythm quickly.\n\nThe energy rolls through you like second nature—tight fists, high arms, quick pivots. You're sharper than you thought you'd be, and even Mia looks surprised when you don't immediately fumble.\n\nShe leads, snapping out crisp counts: \"Five-six-seven-eight!\" Her voice is sharp and playful at once, keeping you on pace.\n\n\"You're not bad,\" Mia says between beats. \"For a newbie, of course.\"\n\n\"You're just scared that I'm gonna outshine you,\" you shoot back without missing a step.\n\nShe laughs—a real, full laugh—and spins into the next move. \"Keep dreaming.\"\n\nJessica walks past your groups while you're mid-sequence, tapping her clipboard. \"Wow, good energy,\" she says. She even looks a little surprised herself when she glances between you and Mia.\n\nMia just shrugs like being good at this was never in doubt.\n\nYou power through the rest of the sequence, sweat prickling at the back of your neck. As you hit the final pose—a sharp punch to the sky—you can feel the adrenaline humming under your skin, the strange but addictive high of getting it right.\n\nMia lowers her arms and gives you a sly side-eye. \"Not bad, [name]. Guess you're not just here to look pretty after all.\"\n\nYou can't tell if that was meant to be a genuine compliment.\n\n[Choice: Lean into the rivalry]\n[Choice: Be grateful]",

If she's going to throw jabs, you're more than willing to throw them right back.\n\n \n \n \n You let out a small breath, still catching your balance from the last move, and offer Mia a genuine smile. \"Thanks,\" you say earnestly. \"I'm just doing my best to keep up.\"\n\n Mia arches an eyebrow like she's not sure what to do with the sincerity, then smirks anyway. \"Careful,' she says. \"You're going to ruin your vibe if you keep being that nice.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath, feeling a little tighter as you jog back toward the center of the mats with her.

I'll see you all on Friday.\"\n\nThere's a scatter of relieved laughter and tired chatter as the squad starts gathering their things. You sling your bag over your shoulder, heading after them, but your steps slow the closer you get. The girls are already vanishing into the locker room. But you hover awkwardly a few feet away, the familiar uncertainty creeping in.\n\nTechnically you're part of the squad. Technically you could just walk right in. But standing there in your practice uniform, you can feel that invisible line, razor-thin and tense.\n\nYou shuffle your feet, pretending to fiddle with your phone, trying not to look like you don't know where the hell you're supposed to go.\n\nThat's when you notice her.\n\nJessica, sitting alone up in the lower rows of the bleachers, her back hunched slightly, her clipboard resting forgotten on the bench beside her. She's not on her phone, not texting or snapping selfies like usual. She just... sits there, staring out at the empty field with her hands twisted in the hem of her skirt.\n\nYou hesitate, then head toward her before you can talk yourself out of it. Your sneakers thud lightly against the metal steps as you climb up and slide onto the bench beside her, leaving a respectful bit of space between you.\n\nJessica doesn't look at you right away. She just exhales slowly through her nose, her shoulders stiff.\n\n\"You know, this whole field's gonna be packed on Friday,\" she says after a moment. \"Parents, students, teachers... everybody.\"\n\nShe presses her lips into a thin line, still staring out over the empty field like she can already see the crowd filling every inch. \"And all of them are gonna be watching us. Watching me. Expecting it to be good.\"\n\nHer fingers twist the hem of her skirt even tighter, knuckles whitening. She doesn't say she's scared, but she doesn't have to. It's in the way she sits too stiffly, the way her voice dips a little too low.\n\nYou sit there for a second, the cool metal of the bleachers buzzing faintly under you, the late afternoon air settling thick around both of you.\n\nJessica finally glances your way, just for a second, then quickly looks back out at the field—like she's giving you a tiny window to say something if you want.\n\n[Choice: Tease her a little]\n[Choice: Open up about your own fears]\n[Choice: Remind her she has a team]\n[Choice: Just put your hand on hers]",

If there's anyone in this whole school who could organize a perfect halftime show with their eyes closed, it's you.\"\n\n Jessica lets out a short laugh through her nose, but it's thin, brittle. She tugs once more at the hem of her skirt before forcing her hands to flatten out on her lap.\n\n \"Right,\" she says. \"Jessica Sanders. Always perfect.\"\n\n She says it like it's a weight chained to her ankles.\n\n You catch the way her words sag at the end, but you're still trying to keep it light, still thinking maybe another joke will shake it off.\n\n \"Hey, even if you do mess up, at least you'll still look good doing it. Nobody's gonna remember a missed count when you're out there stealing the show.\"\n\n Jessica gives a thin smile and then straightens up a little too quickly. Her body snaps back into that poised, untouchable position that means she's done.\n\n \"Thanks, [name],\" she says, voice smooth but hollow. \"You should probably go change before they lock things up.\"\n\n The words aren't sharp, but they land like a door clicking shut between you.\n\n She grabs her clipboard, tucks it under one arm, and stands. Without waiting for an answer, she steps down the bleachers, heading away with brisk, even strides.\n\n You watch her go, a weird twist in your stomach you can't quite name, and wonder if you said the wrong thing at exactly the wrong time.\n\n \n <<if [social] > 59>> \n \n You shift on the bench, feeling the weight in Jessica's voice, the quiet tension she's trying to hide. You take a breath and decide to just... be real with her.\n\n \"I get it,\" you say softly, keeping your eyes on the football field. \"It's a lot. Everyone expecting you to be perfect all the time. It gets heavy.\"\n\n Jessica doesn't say anything, but she doesn't pull away either. You take it as a good sign and keep going, albeit carefully.\n\n \"I feel it too,\" you admit. \"Not on your level, but... every day it feels like I'm pretending a little. Like if I slip up once, everyone's gonna notice and I'll never hear the end of it. It's exhausting, always trying to be what people want you to be.\"\n\n You glance at her, giving her space to interrupt if she wants. She doesn't.\n\n \"Look, all I'm saying is that you're not alone, Jessica,\" you say gently. \"You don't have to carry all of it by yourself. You've got us. Even if things aren't perfect, it doesn't mean you're letting anyone down.\"\n\n Jessica finally looks at you, really looks at you, and for a moment the mask drops. The tightness in her shoulder eases, and there's something close to relief in her expression.\n\n \"Thanks,\" she says quietly. \"I... I needed to hear that.\"\n\n You offer her a small smile, and for the first time since practice ended, she gives you a real one back. Not the polished one, but something honest and a little tired.\n\n She stands up, stretching her arms above her head. \"Come on, we've got to change before they lock us out.\"\n\n You laugh and hop up to follow her, the distance between you lighter now, like the weight she was carrying isn't quite as heavy anymore.\n \n \n \n You shift awkwardly on the bench, feeling the weight of her words settle between you like a thick fog. Before you can second-guess yourself, though, you blurt out, \"Yeah, I get it. I mean, not what you're going through exactly, but...\"\n\n You trail off for half a second, but the words are already spilling out, tumbling over themselves.\n\n \"I've been freaking out too,\" you say quickly, staring at the field so you don't have to meet her eyes. \"About practice, about screwing up, about looking stupid in front of everyone. Like, sometimes I barely even move without overthinking it. And it's not like I'm some expert or whatever—I'm just... trying not to be the reason everything falls apart, you know?\"\n\n You let out a nervous laugh, scratching the back of your neck. Jessica stays quiet beside you. But you're caught in the runaway momentum of oversharing.\n\n \"And it's not even just cheerleading, really,\" you continue, voice too loud. \"It's like... everything lately. Like I'm stuck between who I'm supposed to be and who I'm actually turning into, and it's terrifying. Every time I think I'm getting it right, it just gets harder, and—\"\n\n You stop yourself with a hard swallow, realizing to late how much you're rambling.\n\n The silence afterward is deafening.\n\n You glance at Jessica. She's sitting stiffly, hands folded neatly over her knees, her face perfectly composed. Too composed.\n\n Your stomach sinks. You messed things up. You weren't supposed to make this about you.\n\n Jessica stands slowly, smoothing out her skirt. \"You should probably get changed,\" she says, polite but distant. She's not angry, just... done.\n\n She grabs her clipboard from the bench and heads down the stairs without another word, her sneakers tapping rhythmically against the metal as she disappears.\n\n You sit there a minute longer, the cold breeze prickling at your skin, wondering how you always seem to say the wrong thing when it matters most.\n \n\n \n \n You lean forward a little before speaking.\n\n \"You know,\" you say, keeping your voice even and steady, \"it's not just on you.\"\n\n Jessica doesn't look at you, but you can see her shoulders tense, like she's bracing for some kind of pity she doesn't want. You keep going, albeit carefully, choosing your words like stepping stones across a river.\n\n \"I mean it,\" you say. \"You're not out there by yourself on Friday. You have us. We're not perfect either, but we're here. And we'll have your back, no matter what happens.\"\n\n You glance over at her. She's staring hard at the field, blinking a little faster than usual. Her fingers fidget with the edge of her clipboard, but she's listening.\n\n \"You're not the only one who cares about making it good, trust me,\" you add. \"We all want to make you proud. We're all in this together.\"\n\n There's a long pause.\n\n The breeze picks up, tugging gently at the edges of her skirt and sending loose strands of blonde hair dancing across her face.\n\n Finally, Jessica lets out a shaky exhale, and turns her head toward you. Her smile is small but real, fragile in a way you rarely see from her.\n\n \"Thanks,\" she says, her voice quieter than usual but much more genuine. \"I guess... I forget about that, sometimes.\"\n\n You shrug lightly, giving her a sideways grin. \"That's what we're here for. To remind you that you're not superhuman. Just almost.\"\n\n Jessica laughs softly, a real laugh, and for a second she looks less like the untouchable queen of Pacific Crest High School and more like a regular girl who's trying her best.\n\n She pushes herself to her feet, rolling her shoulders back. \"Alright. Before they lock us out of the locker room for real.\"\n\n You hop up beside her. As you walk toward the locker rooms together, you can feel the weight around her lighten a little, like maybe she's letting herself breathe again.\n\n \n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n \n \n You hesitate, heart drumming against your ribs, and then you reach out and place your hand over hers, stopping the restless twisting of her skirt.\n\n Jessica stiffens for the briefest moment, her eyes darting down to where your fingers brush hers. For a heartbeat, you think maybe you messed up—maybe you crossed some line you didn't even know was there.\n\n But then her fingers relax under your touch.\n\n She doesn't pull away.\n\n Instead, she shifts lightly, her pinky hooking shyly around yours. Her cheeks are flushed a soft pink now, the fading sunlight catching the faint color blooming high on her cheeks. She lets out a tiny, breathy laugh, more of a puff of air than anything, and tucks a piece of hair behind her ear—a little clumsy, a little too fast.\n\n \"Is... Is this meant to be a substitute for a pep talk?\" she asks, her voice quiet and a little wobbly.\n\n You grin, the kind you can't quite hold back, and squeeze her hand just a little. \"Yeah, well,\" you say, trying to keep it light. \"I figured you already have enough people pretending they know exactly what to say. Thought you might need a person who's just... kinda winging it. You know?\"\n \n Jessica lets out a real laugh this time, soft and genuine, and it warms you from the inside out. She ducks her head, trying to hide her smile for half a second before glancing up at you, her blue eyes shining even brighter now.\n\n \"I guess it's kind of nice,\" she murmurs, voice tipping into something almost shy. \"Not being expected to be perfect for once.\"\n\n For a second, everything stills—the warm air, the far-off buzz of traffic, even the long stretch of the empty field in front of you. It's just the two of you, [name] and Jessica, caught in a rare moment of peace.\n\n Jessica bites her lip, like she wants to say something but isn't quite ready yet. Instead, she gently pulls her hand back, but not abruptly—more like she's tucking the moment away and keeping it safe.\n\n She rises to her feet, smoothing her skirt in a familiar gesture, but her movements look slower now, more relaxed. She clutches her clipboard tighter than necessary and looks down at you with a real smile.\n\n \"Come on, [name],\" she says, her voice a little breathless. \"Before we get locked out of the locker room and have to go home in cheerleading outfits.\"\n\n You laugh and hop up beside her. You fall into step next to her naturally, like this was how it was supposed to be, the distance between you lighter and easier now.\n\n Neither of you says much as you walk across the field, but you don't need to. You can feel the shift—something quiet and hopeful weaving between you, something that wasn't there before.\n\n You didn't say the perfect thing, but you didn't need to. \n \n \n \n You hesitate for a second, unsure what to say. Words feel heavy and your tongue feels clumsy.\n\n So instead, you reach out and set your hand gently over hers, stilling the fidgeting fingers twisting at the hem of her skirt.\n\n Jessica freezes.\n\n At first, she doesn't move—doesn't even breathe—and for half a second you think maybe it's okay. Maybe it's comforting. Maybe it's what she needed.\n\n But then you see it—the way her whole body stiffens, a flash of something like discomfort tightening her jaw. She pulls her hand away firmly, folding it tightly into her lap like she's trying to shrink away without making a scene.\n\n You pull your hand back immediately, heat flooding your face. The air between you turns dense, prickling with awkwardness.\n\n Jessica clears her throat, forcing a polite smile. \"I should, uh... I should go change. Big day Friday and all.\"\n\n She stands up too fast, smoothing her skirt down like armor, her clipboard tucked tightly under her arm. She doesn't meet your eyes, and her steps down the bleachers are quicker than they were before—like she's trying to escape without making it obvious.\n\n You sit there, your hand still hovering uselessly for a second longer, your stomach dropping.\n\n You didn't mean to make things weird. But you definitely did.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Cheerleading practice over!]",

The hum of conversation is louder this time—excited, focused, and peppered with the occasional snap of fabric or the hiss of a steamer.\n\nThe space smells faintly of linen starch and citrusy fabric spray. Tables are covered in sketchbooks, swatches, and safety pins that look like they've seen several wars. Mood boards lean against the room, covered in Polaroids, color palettes, and scrawled notes like \"whimsical but structured???\"\n\nThere are at least a dozen girls here today, and they're all busy. Some give you polite nods while others just politely look over you once.\n\nYou probably blend in pretty well.\n\n\"Oh, look who's back!\" comes a voice from near the window. Jessica, dressed in her usual outfit, waves at you. \"Come on, we've got so much to show you.\"\n\nBefore you can answer, a taller figure emerges from behind the mannequin—Sierra, the club leader. She's wearing oversized overalls splattered with dye and a black turtleneck.\n\n\"We're starting to prepare for the Fall Showcase in two weeks,\" she says with clipped enthusiasm. \"This piece is part of our 'First Frost' collection—think shifting light, crisp air, warmth fading into chill. You need just enough shimmer to feel like magic's literally in the air.\"\n\nShe gestures toward a rack of in-progress outfits.\n\n\"And,\" Jessica chimes in, sliding up beside her, \"we need someone to model one of the centerpiece looks today. Sierra was gonna do it, but she needs to keep adjusting the design.\"\n\nSeveral of the girls turn to look at you in perfect, synchronized fashion.\n\n<<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You raise your hands slightly, a weak protest already forming.\n\n \"Wait, hold on, I mean—I'm not really the... dress type.\"\n\n But your voice doesn't exactly land with conviction. Especially not with your eyes darting back to the dress Sierra's holding up—the delicate ruffles, the soft blues, the way it sparkles faintly under the overhead lights.\n\n You shouldn't want this.\n\n In fact, you don't want this.\n\n Probably.\n\n But your heart does this strange little flutter, and before you can process that treacherous warmth in your chest, Jessica's already grinning and giving you a look that says \"you'd look so cute in this and we both know it.\"\n\n You mumble. \"It's just for trying on, right?\"\n\n Sierra smirks. \"Of course.\"\n\n [Choice: Accept immediately]\n [Choice: Accept reluctantly]\n [Choice: Protest, but secretly want to try it on]\n [Choice: Refuse]\n\n \n Your spine goes stiff. You blink once. Twice.\n\n \"Uh—me?\"You gesture awkwardly at yourself. \"In that?\"\n\n Jessica nods like it's the most obvious thing in the world. \"Yeah! You've got the right frame, and you pull off delicate really well.\"\n\n \"Delicate?\" you reply, wincing.\n\n You look at the outfit again. It's undeniably pretty. Blue, soft, kind of shimmery—but it's definitely not something you've ever seen yourself wearing. Not even as a joke.\n\n \"I don't know if that's really... my thing,\" you start, rubbing the back of your neck. \"I'm not exactly a—uh—model.\"\n\n Sierra tilts her head, cool and composed. \"We don't need a model. We need someone who fits the vibe. And right now? That's you.\"\n\n You don't move.\n\n Jessica pouts. \"It would really help. Just for a sec?\"\n\n You sigh. You're cornered by glitter of all things.\n\n [Choice: Accept reluctantly]\n [Choice: Refuse]",

She hands the dress to you with both hands, like it's something precious.\n\n And when your fingers touch the fabric, you feel it. Not just the weight of the dress, but something else. Like maybe this moment has been waiting for you.\n\n You don't even try to explain the flutter in your chest, the quiet rush of yes that floods in like sunlight through an open window.\n\n \"You're gonna look amazing,\" Jessica says.\n\n You hold the dress a little closer, not like it's a costume or a favor, but like it's yours.\n\n Sierra nods toward the changing curtain, already pulling out matching accessories like this is the most natural thing in the world.\n\n You walk over with the dress in your arms, something warm blooming in your chest.\n\n It feels right.\n\n [Choice: Go to wear it]\n\n \n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You look at the dress.\n\n Then at Jessica. Then Sierra. Then the rest of the girls, who are watching you with this open, easy kind of expectation—not pushy or patronizing. Just like they see something you're still figuring out how to look at.\n\n You run your thumb over the edge of the hanger. The fabric is soft. Lighter than you thought it'd be. Pretty in a way that feels kind of dangerous if you think about it too long.\n\n Jessica's voice is gentle. \"You don't have to. But I think you'd really pull it off.\"\n\n You hesitate. Not because you don't want to, but because you do.\n\n You swallow down that flicker of fear that always shows up when something feels too close to honest.\n\n \"...Okay,\" you say, quietly. \"Yeah. I'll try it.\"\n\n Jessica's face lights up with genuine appreciation. \"Thank you. Seriously.\"\n\n Sierra just gives a satisfied nod. \"Changing room's over there.\"\n\n You take the dress and walk toward the curtain, heart thudding a little louder than before.\n\n You're not doing this to help. You're not doing it as a joke. You're doing it because, somewhere deep down, you want to see.\n \n \n You look at the dress.\n\n Then at Jessica. Then Sierra. Then the dozen other girls in the room watching you—not with judgment, not even really with curiosity, but with this weird kind of encouragement.\n\n You run a hand through your hair and let out a breath. \"You're really sure I'm the best choice for this?\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head. \"Well, you've go the right shape for the cut, the shoulders for the sleeves, and the height to pull off the silhouette. We wouldn't ask if we didn't mean it.\"\n\n You stare at the hanger again. It's a nice dress. Not something you'd ever wear, but objectively nice. Still, it's definitely not you.\n\n You hesitate just a moment longer.\n\n Then sigh.\n\n \"...Alright,\" you mutter. \"Fine. I'll do it.\"\n\n Jessica's face lights up with genuine appreciation. \"Thank you. Seriously.\"\n\n Sierra just gives a satisfied nod. \"Changing room's over there.\"\n\n You grab the hanger like it might bite you and start walking toward the curtain.\n\n You're not thrilled about this. You're not curious. You're not trying to make some kind of statement. You're just helping out.\n\n That's all.\n \n\n [Choice: Go to wear it]\n\n \n \n You shift your weight from one foot to the other as every pair of eyes in the room lands squarely on you. The shimmering hope and excitement is impossible to ignore.\n\n Jessica clasps her hands like she's already picturing you in the dress. Sierra tilts her head, cool and calm, like she knows the answer before you do.\n\n You swallow. Hard.\n\n \"Uhm...\" You lift your hands a little. \"I mean... it's... a dress.\"\n\n You say it like that's supposed to disqualify you.\n\n Sierra just raises an eyebrow.\n\n You glance at the hanger again. The dress is beautiful. Light blue with delicate lace, cinched at the waist with a ribbon that catches the light just enough to sparkle. It's soft. It's... pretty.\n\n There's a quiet, fluttering warmth in your chest. You try to ignore it.\n\n You try.\n\n \"But like...\" you add quickly, eyes darting anywhere but the dress. \"I'm not—uh. I'm not a girl.\"\n\n Jessica's voice is gentle. \"No one said you had to be.\"\n\n You pause, her words settling somewhere deep.\n\n Sierra adds, \"We asked because it would look good on you. That's it. That's the whole reason.\"\n\n You blink. Slowly. And in that silence, something inside you quietly unfurls. Like the very first breath of winter against your cheek.\n\n \"...Okay,\" you say softly.\n\n Jessica lights up immediately. \"Yes! The dressing room's that way. I'll grab some shoes too.\"\n\n As you follow her, part of you wants to rationalize this. Call it a favor. An experiment. Something temporary.\n\n But the other part? The one that's been whispering all along?\n\n It's not protesting at all.\n\n [Choice: Go to wear it]\n\n \n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You shift uncomfortably, eyes lingering on the dress for a second too long before tearing them away.\n\n \"It's not really my thing,\" you say quickly. \"I'll pass.\"\n \n Jessica blinks, surprised—but she doesn't push. She just gives a small nod, like she heard more in your voice than you meant to give away.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says softly. \"Offer's open if you change your mind.\"\n\n You nod once, keeping your face neutral as you sit back down. But your hands refuse to stop fidgeting in your lap.\n\n You don't look at the dress again. It's like something you almost touched, but weren't ready for.\n \n \n You glance at the dress, then quickly look away, forcing a short laugh.\n\n \"Yeah, uh... I'm good,\" you say, trying to keep it casual. \"Not really my vibe.\"\n\n Jessica doesn't press. She just gives a polite nod and hands the dress back to Sierra.\n\n \"No worries,\" she says. \"Thanks for considering it.\"\n\n You sit back down, relieved—though part of you still feels weird being in the middle of this. Maybe you should've picked another club.\n \n\n [Choice: Finish up with the Fashion Club]",

Her heels click quietly against the tile, the usual bounce in her step dialed down to something gentler.\n\n She doesn't say anything at first. Just hands you the dress with a soft, knowing smile.\n\n The fabric is lighter than you expected. Soft, layered, delicate in a way that feels almost too nice to touch. You hold it for a second, letting your fingers trail along the off-shoulder neckline, the ribbon at the waist, and the embroidered detailing near the hem.\n\n \"...Are you okay if I help you with the zipper?\" Jessica asks, voice low and sincere.\n\n You nod, just once.\n\n You pull the curtain closed behind you and step out of your clothes slowly, your heart beating a little too fast. You try not to look in the mirror yet. You're not ready.\n\n Not until the dress is on.\n\n You step into it, careful not to tug too hard, and slide the straps into place. It fits surprisingly well, like it's meant for you. It's almost like the fabric already knew the shape of you before you did.\n\n Jessica steps in quietly when you call her, helps with the zipper, and smooths out the back.\n\n She doesn't joke or tease.\n\n <<if [jessicaRomance] > 9>> \n She meets your eyes and her voice drops just enough to feel like something unspoken is riding the edge of it. \"You look really good,\" she says. Then, quieter: \"Like, really good.\"\n \n \n She just meets your eyes in the mirror and says, \"You look good.\"\n \n\n You don't answer. You can't. Because when you do look in the mirror, it's like something slots quietly into place. Not loudly or dramatically—but gently. Like a drawer finally closing. Like breathing out after holding it for too long.\n\n You're still you. And also... maybe not just you.\n\n Your reflection is softer, sure. But there's a certain strength in the softness that feels earned. The kind that's been there all along, just waiting for you to stop running.\n\n <<if [jessicaRomance] > 9>> \n Jessica steps back a little, eyes trailing over the way the dress settles against your frame—not critically, but like she's memorizing the moment.\n\n \"We can tweak the sleeves a bit for the show,\" she says softly, arms folding across her chest. \"But honestly? That's the only thing I'd touch.\"\n\n You look at the mirror, still unsure, still holding your breath. \"Do you really think it looks okay?\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head and smiles. But it's not that performative grin she gives in hallways or classrooms. This one's smaller. Quieter. Real.\n\n \"I think you look... beautiful,\" she says, and her voice dips at the end like it surprised even her. \"And not just because of the dress.\"\n\n Your heart skips—because she's not teasing.\n\n Then she catches herself and laughs once, soft and close. \"I mean, you're kind of glowing, [name]. It's not fair.\"\n\n And for a second, you don't know what to say. But part of you doesn't want to say anything at all. Not if it means this moment ends.\n \n \n Jessica steps back a little and folds her arms. \"We can adjust the sleeves a bit for the show, but honestly? That's all I'd change.\"\n\n You blink. \"You really think it looks okay?\"\n\n She laughs once—light, not mocking. \"[name], I think you're glowing.\"\n\n And for a moment, you are.\n\n Not because of the dress, but because just for this one quiet, perfect second—\n\n You let yourself want it.\n \n\n \n Jessica leads you to the curtained-off changing area with practiced ease, the dress draped carefully over her arm. She's smiling, but it's subdued. Maybe she can tell you're easy. Maybe she's giving you space to breathe.\n\n She hands you the dress without a word, and you stare at it for a second too long. Light blue, soft, and floaty. Definitely not something you've ever imagined putting on—not for Halloween, not as a joke, and definitely not at school.\n\n You hesitate, but you also don't say no.\n\n Behind the curtain, you change slowly, careful not to wrinkle the fabric. You don't look in the mirror at first—just get it on, zip it up, and fidget with the sleeves. It fits... surprisingly well. Too well, maybe. The thought makes your stomach twist.\n\n \"Need help?\" Jessica's voice comes from just outside.\n\n You clear your throat. \"Uh, yeah. Zipper's a little stuck.\"\n\n She steps in and fixes it without comment. No teasing. No weird looks. Just a quiet efficiency like this is just another fitting, nothing more.\n\n When she steps back, her hands rest lightly on her hips as she gives you a quick once-over.\n\n \"Nice,\" she says genuinely. \"Good posture. The skirt falls right. I think the sleeves need a small adjustment, but otherwise? Yeah. It works.\"\n\n You shift awkwardly, eyes finally drifting to the mirror. You barely recognize yourself. Not only because you look like someone else, but because there's something so... different about the way the dress reshapes your image.\n\n It's still you. But not really how you see yourself.\n\n You rub the back of your neck. \"This is... kinda weird.\"\n\n Jessica catches your eye in the mirror. \"Yeah. But you're doing it anyway, and I respect that.\"\n\n You nod once, unsure what to say. You're not uncomfortable, exactly. But you're not comfortable either.\n\n \"Don't worry,\" Jessica reassures. \"We're not trying to make you into anyone else. We just needed a body the dress would fit.\"\n\n There's something grounding about that. Simple. Clear.\n\n You exhale, a little of the tension leaving your shoulders.\n\n It's just fabric. It doesn't change who you are.\n \n\n[Choice: Put on the shoes]",

Not hesitation—just noticing that your legs are shaved.\n\n Her eyes flick upward, meeting yours briefly. Then, she gives a nod of approval.\n\n \"Smooth,\" she murmurs, more to herself than to you, and you feel your ears go warm. \"Looks good.\"\n\n She slips the first shoe on gently, then the second, her fingers grazing your skin lightly. It's clear she knows exactly what you're doing, and she's even more aware of the way you're watching her right now.\n\n She doesn't say anything right away. Just looks up at you where she's crouched, eyes catching the light. In that quiet moment, you feel something very, very real shift.\n \n \n You lift one foot awkwardly, suddenly aware of how hairy your legs are. They're not smooth, and very exposed now that you're in a dress.\n\n Jessica pauses slightly as her fingers brush your ankle. She doesn't say anything at first, opting to just gently slip the shoe on with the same calm care as before.\n\n But after a beat, her lips quirk up.\n \n \"You know, you could rock the leg hair thing,\" she says, looking up at you. \"You're pulling it off more than you think.\"\n\n She dusts her hands together and steps back, eyes scanning you head to toe—not judging, just... taking you in.\n\n And the way she's looking at you?\n\n Yeah.\n\n The leg hair's not exactly killing the vibe.\n \n \n\n Jessica glances down and murmurs with a playful smile, \"...Okay, not to be weird, but your feet are kinda stupidly nice.\"\n\n \"Way to ruin the moment,\" you say, chuckling.\n\n \"I just had to comment.\"\n \n\n \n Jessica kneels down beside the chair, white flats in hand. Her expression is focused. She slips the first shoe on carefully, making sure it doesn't catch on the hem of the dress, then reaches for the second.\n\n \n \"You've got a good foot shape,\" she says, almost absentmindedly, like she's already analyzing proportions. \"Rounded toe works better when ankles are this narrow.\"\n\n You blink. \"Is that a compliment?\"\n\n She grins a little, but it's all in good fun. \"It's a design note. Don't let it get to your head.\"\n \n \n \"Okay, so your feet aren't dainty,\" she says, \"but they'll do. We've worked with worse.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Is that an insult?\"\n\n \"It's a professional observation,\" she says, smirking.\n \n\n She finishes and rises to her feet, brushing her hands together.\n\n \"There.

You've already checked the mirror several times, but it still catches you off guard. The shape. The softness. The strange, quiet rightness of it.\n\n You take a breath.\n\n And then you step out.\n\n The room goes quiet—not in a dramatic way, but like a hush that falls when something just works. A few of the girls look up, pausing mid-sentence or mid-stitch. Jessica is standing a few feet away, sorting through fabric swatches, and she actually stops what she's doing when she sees you.\n\n <<if [jessicaRomance] > 9>> \n Her eyes widen, just a little. Then soften.\n\n \"Woah,\" she says quietly, almost under her breath. \"Okay, that's a look.\"\n \n \n \"You look great,\" she says, beaming.\n \n\n You don't know what to do with your hands, so you let them hover awkwardly at your sides.\n\n \"It doesn't look... weird?\" you ask, voice quiet.

She just means it.\n\n You nod, trying not to smile too hard.\n\n Weirdly enough, standing here in the middle of a busy room full of pins and fabric scraps, you feel seen.\n\n \n You linger behind the curtain for a second longer than necessary, staring down at your hands gripping the sides of the dress. It's not uncomfortable—the fabric's soft and the fit is fine—but it feels like you're stepping into someone else's reflection.\n\n You sigh quietly and push the curtain aside.\n\n The room doesn't go silent, but a few heads turn. Some of the girls glance up from their sketchbooks or sewing projects. Jessica's the first to actually react.\n\n She gives you a quick once-over and nods, like she's checking off a mental list.\n\n \"Nice,\" she says simply. \"The fit's actually better than I thought.\"\n\n \"I'm glad I could... be helpful, I guess.\"\n\n Jessica catches that hesitation and offers a small smile—warm, but not overly personal.\n\n \"You don't have to be into it,\" she says. \"You're doing us a favor. That's all.\"\n\n You nod, not really knowing what to say. You're not miserable, but you're not exactly joyful either. This isn't you, not really. Just something you agreed to.\n\n Still, the dress moves quietly around your legs when you shift, and there's a strange sense of calm.\n\n Just another weird day in Fashion Club. Nothing more.\n \n\nSierra appears beside Jessica with a measuring tape draped around her neck like a statement piece and a pencil already tucked behind one ear. The two of them move into position with smooth efficiency. It's clear that this isn't their first fitting rodeo.\n\n\"Arms out, please,\" Sierra says.\n\nYou do as you're told, holding your arms slightly away from your sides while Jessica steps in to adjust the sleeves and Sierra takes measurements along the waist and shoulder seams.\n\n\"The hem's a little long,\" Jessica mutters, crouching to pinch the fabric.\n\nSierra nods. \"We can take it up an inch, maybe two.\"\n\nThey move around you with the calm focus of people in their element. Sierra gently adjusts the neckline and a couple of the girls peek over, giving quiet commentary.\n\n\"Skirt flow is good,\" one says.\n\n\"The back seam's a little loose,\" another adds.\n\nJessica steps back and tilts her head. \"You're carrying it well,\" she says. \"We'll tighten the bodice, shorten the hem, and maybe add a little more structure to the sleeves.\"\n\nSierra's already scribbling notes on a clipboard. \"We can do all of that by next week. You free to try it again later?\"\n\nYou nod.\n\n\"You made this a lot easier, you know,\" Jessica says, giving you a smile. \"Thanks.\"\n\nAnd somehow, in your own way, you kind of did.\n\n[Choice: Finish up with the Fashion Club]",

You stay in the dress longer than you expected—partly because they need extra reference for adjustments, and partly because nobody rushes you to change.\n\n The girls move around you as they tuck here, measure there, and debate whether the ribbon at the waist should be double-knotted. Someone occasionally steps back to squint thoughtfully at you, as if seeing a vision they hadn't expected.\n\n Jessica loops back around once or twice, helping with pins or smoothing out wrinkles in the skirt, always flashing you an easy smile when your eyes meet. Not over-the-top or making a big deal out of it. Just... normal.\n\n And somehow, even with the dress, you settle into it. It becomes less strange and more routine. It's like you're helping build something real.\n\n Finally, Sierra claps her hands once. \"Alright! We've got everything we need for now. Great work today.\"\n\n There's a round of applause—half for you and half for themselves—and a general scattering as people begin packing up.\n\n Jessica steps closer, holding out a bag with your regular clothes inside. \"You can go change back now.\"\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You nod, taking it. You're going to step back from all this for now.\n \n \n You nod, taking it. You're going to step back from all this now.\n \n \n They made space for you today, and you took it.\n\n \n You never put on the dress, but that didn't mean you didn't help.\n\n After the initial wave of attention faded, the club fell back into its usual rhythm—fabric rustling, scissors snipping, quiet debates over threads and hemlines. You drifted into the background a little, offering an extra pair of hands when someone needed help holding fabric steady or passing along pins. You even helped untangle a crazy knot in the trim drawer that had apparently haunted the club for years now.\n\n Nobody gave you any grief for saying no.\n\n Jessica tossed you a smile here and there. Sierra handed you a clipboard at one point and said, \"You've got a good eye,\" like it was just a fact, not a compliment.\n\n The work wasn't glamorous, but it felt... useful. Like you were actually part of something.\n\n Eventually, Sierra claps her hands. \"Alright, that's it for today.\"\n\n There is a small ripple of polite applause for the work done before everyone starts packing up.\n\n Jessica passes by you as she grabs her bag. \"Thanks for helping out today,\" she says.\n\n You nod.\n\n Even without putting on the dress, the club made space for you.\n \n\n[Choice: Go to lunch]",

It ain't glamorous, but it's important. First thing people see when they walk in is the tables—gotta keep 'em looking sharp.\"\n\n You make your way over and set your bag carefully down under the counter nearby. Up close, the table looks even worse—a battlefield of shirts in the wrong size stacks, jackets that probably belonged three racks away, and a hoodie someone had clearly just given up on folding halfway through.\n\n You take a breath, plant your feet, and get to work. The rhythm of it settles in quickly—straightening out shirts, smoothing wrinkles, lining up the size tags. Fold, straighten, stack. It's mindless, sure, but kinda satisfying as well. Out of the corner of your eyes, you catch Kendra watching you from the register, arms crossed, a faintly amused smile on her face. She doesn't say anything, just gives you a small nod when you glance over, letting you know you're on the right track.\n\n By the time you're done with it, the table looks clean. You brush your hands off against your pants, feeling a small, solid sense of accomplishment settle in your chest.\n\n Not a bad start.

It's a delicate balance—to be approachable without being pushy—but you're doing a good job at it.\n\n When you glance back at the counter, Kendra's watching you with an approving smile, arms crossed over her clipboard.\n\n \"Look at you, already workin' the floor like a pro,\" she says with a wink. \"We're gonna keep you around for sure.\"\n\n You grin back, feeling a buzz of pride hum through you. Right now, you're making it work.\n \n \n \"I'll, uh, greet people,\" you say, doing your best to sound confident.\n\n Kendra raises an eyebrow, clearly a little surprised, but then she smiles. \"Love the initiative, [name]. Go get 'em.\"\n\n You nod, wipe your sweaty palms on your jeans when she's not looking, and make your way toward the front of the store. The closer you get, the heavier your footsteps feel. Your mind blanks in that horrible way it does way too often, and suddenly you can't remember what you're meant to say.\n\n You panic.\n\n \"Um... hi,\" you blurt, voice weirdly high-pitched. \"Welcome to... shopping.\"\n\n They stare at you. One raises an eyebrow. The other bites her lip like she's trying not to laugh.\n\n You feel your face burning but barrel on, desperate to fill the silence. \"If you, uh, need clothes... I mean, if you want clothes. Which obviously, you do. Because you're here. In... the store.\"\n\n Both girls exchange a look that's impossible to read but definitely not encouraging.\n\n \"Thanks,\" one of them says flatly, before they turn back to their phones.\n\n You groan under your breath and pivot toward the guy flipping through the jackets, determined not to mess this one up.\n\n You had one more shot, and you were going to make the most of it.\n\n \"Hey!\" you say, a little too loudly. The guy jumps like you startled him. \"Uh, if you need a jacket—or like... advice... on jackets... I can help. Or not, if you're good.\"\n\n He nods slowly, clearly unnerved, and mutters, \"I'm good,\" before walking off toward the jeans section without looking back.\n\n You stand there for a second, feeling like you might actually dissolve into a puddle of goo out of embarrassment. You turn and shuffle back toward the counter where Kendra is watching you with barely concealed amusement.\n\n She doesn't say anything right away, opting to just offer a sympathetic smile.\n\n \"First day jitters,\" she says kindly. \"You'll get the hang of it.

The overhead light is broken, occasionally flickering like it's got a ghost stuck in it. The space smells faintly of old books and incense. The blinds are drawn.

      "text": "You barely even hesitate.\n\n The moment Aurora gestures toward the door, Milo's already halfway upright. You don't know what you expected when you joined the Occult Club—rituals? Tarot? A weekly horoscope and maybe some light spooky vibes?—but \"expedition\" is new.\n\n Still... your feet are moving before you can think twice.\n\n \"Yep,\" you say. \"Why the hell not.\"\n\n Aurora turns. She doesn't say anything, but there's a flicker of approval in her expression. Not a smile. Not quite. Just the slightest shift in her eyes, like you passed some test she never told you about.\n\n Milo practically hops behind her. \"Yes! You're gonna love this. Or hate it. But probably love it.\"\n\n You smirk. \"That's encouraging.\"\n\n Aurora pauses at the door. She glances over her shoulder at you, gaze sharp but calm.\n\n \"Good,\" she says. \"You'll need that attitude.\"\n\n \"Should I be worried?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n She doesn't answer, opting to just open the door.\n\n You take a step forward, not looking back.\n\n \n You watch Aurora glide toward the door like she's leading a procession to the underworld and not just stepping into the school hallway.\n\n Milo is already bouncing on the balls of his feet like a caffeinated raccoon.\n\n You, however, stay put.\n\n \"Okay, hold on,\" you say, crossing your arms. \"Before I follow you into a potentially cursed location, can we clarify one thing?\"\n\n Aurora stops, hand resting on the doorknob. She turns slowly, her expression the picture of serene mystery.\n\n \"Where are we going, exactly?\"\n\n She tilts her head, as if the question itself is charmingly naive. \"To a place the school forgot.\"\n\n Milo makes a dramatic sound from the corner.\n\n You give her a flat look. \"That's not a place. That's a concept.\"\n\n \"Exactly,\" Aurora replies, like that explains everything.\n\n You look to Milo for backup, but he doesn't seem bothered.\n\n \"I asked her that the last time we went on an expedition,\" he says cheerfully. \"She just told me, 'When you find it, you'll know.' Then the lights flickered for six minutes straight.\"\n\n You blink. \"And you didn't think that was maybe a reason to not follow her?\"\n\n \"Oh no, I loved it,\" he says, like you're the weird one.\n\n Aurora simply opens the door, light from the hallway spilling into the dim room like an invitation—or a trap.\n\n \"Well?\" she says, glancing back at you with that knowing half-smile. \"Are you coming or not?\"\n\n You hesitate, but against your better judgment... you follow.\n\n \n You glance at Aurora, then back at Milo—who is practically vibrating with chaotic energy, already halfway to grabbing his notebook like he's preparing for a ghost hunt.\n\n You lean slightly toward him and mutter out of the side of your mouth, \"Do you ever actually know what she's talking about?\"\n\n Milo beams like you just paid him a compliment. \"Nope! Not even a little.\"\n\n You blink.\n\n \"She once spent an entire meeting trying to summon the concept of a memory that had never happened,\" he continues brightly. \"I didn't get it, but I saw a shadow move across the ceiling and my pencil started leaking black ink, so like... something worked?\"\n\n You stare at him. \"And you're just cool with that?\"\n\n Milo nods solemnly. \"She's got the vibes, [name]. You don't question the vibes.\"\n\n Aurora, still not facing either of you, says, \"The vibes are accurate.\"\n\n You make a face, crossing your arms. \"Okay, but what if the vibes get us detention? Or possessed. Or both.\"\n\n Milo shrugs. \"Worth it.\"\n\n You sigh, pinching the bridge of your nose.\n\n Around the room, Aurora moves toward the door. She turns just enough to glance over her shoulder, one eyebrow raised ever so slightly. \"Coming?\"\n\n Milo's already halfway to the door.\n\n And against your better judgment... you follow.\n \n\nThe hallway outside the Occult Club's classroom feels colder than the rest of the school. It's quiet in the way that settles around people.\n\nAurora leads without explanation, the hem of her plaid skirt swaying with every deliberate step. Milo practically buzzes beside her, glancing back at you every few steps like a kid on a field trp he wasn't supposed to be on but is thrilled to be attending.\n\nYou trail them down the hall, past the cafeteria, past the side stairwell, until Aurora suddenly veers off through one of the rarely-used exit doors. It's the kind that's supposed to be for emergencies, but creaks open under her hand like it's been waiting.\n\nOutside, the air hits different—cooler, sharper, laced with the scent of damp earth and autumn leaves. The concrete path back here is cracked and half-swallowed by weeds, hidden behind a wall of overgrown hedges and one sagging chain-link fence that does not look secured. It's the kind of spot no one really visits.\n\nAurora doesn't pause. Her shoes crunch softly over the grass as she makes her way toward the tree line behind the east field, where the school grounds blur.\n\nMilo bounces after her, ducking under a low branch with the kind of unearned confidence only someone with no sense of danger can manage. \"Dude, this is gonna be so good,\" he whispers to you. \"Last time she brought us out here, we found a mystic tree that might've eaten a squirrel. Still unconfirmed.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, hesitating as you reach the edge of the woods.\n\nAurora glances back at you once, the purple tips of her hair catching in the wind.\n\n\"Well?\" she says, voice calm. \"Don't fall behind.\"\n\nYou push past the last tangle of branches, the sound of nature giving way to something... quieter. Quieter than it should be. Like the sound has thinned out around you.\n\nAurora stops just ahead, in a small clearing surrounded by tall pines and a half-buried stone bench, its surface cracked by time and moss.\n\nThe wind goes still.\n\nMilo skids to a stop beside her, his eyes wide. \"Woah. It's doing it again.\"\n\nYou step closer—and feel it.\n\nA low, humming pressure in your chest. Like the moment before a thunderclap. The air here is thick with something—not heat, not cold, but presence. The leaves don't rustle. The sunlight through the canopy doesn't shift. It's as if the clearing itself is holding its breath.\n\nAnd in the center is a circle of stones. Small, deliberate, arranged perfectly on the ground around a patch of untouched earth. The soil inside is almost black, and you could swear it's pulsing.\n\nAurora kneels at the edge of it, running her fingers lightly along one of the stones. She doesn't look up.\n\n\"This isn't a place,\" she says softly. \"It's a wound.\"\n\nYou frown. \"A wound?\"\n\n\"In the world. A tear between what's seen and what's not. It's subtle, but it's open again. Something's drawn it out.\" She looks at you now. \"You feel it, don't you?\"\n\nYou don't respond right away—but your skin prickles, goosebumps forming along the surface. Not with fear, but with something older than that. Recognition.\n\nMilo, standing a little too close to the surface, blurs, \"Can I touch it?\"\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Aurora states.\n\nYou kneel beside them, staring into the center. There's no glow, no light show, no mana. Just earth.\n\nAnd yet... it feels alive.\n\n[Choice: Ask Aurora what this place is]\n[Choice: Step closer and study the circle]\n[Choice: Ask if it's actually safe]",

      "text": "You glance at the stones again. They're perfectly arranged, too precise to be accidental and too strange to be something as simple as a prank. Whatever this is, it feels ancient. Like it was here long before the school, long before you.\n\n You turn to Aurora.\n\n \"Okay, but seriously,\" you say, keeping your voice low. \"What exactly is this place?\"\n\n She doesn't answer right away. Her gaze is fixed on the center of the circle, like it's whispering to her in a language only she understands. Her fingers hover just above the dirt, not touching, but rather listening.\n\n \"It's a threshold,\" she finally says. \"A place where the veil between things is thin. It doesn't show up on maps. It's not on any ley lines. It's more... organic than that. Almost like a bruise.\"\n\n You glance at Milo, who's busy sketching the stone pattern into his notebook with a marker that smells like blueberries.\n\n \"So it's not dangerous?\" you ask.\n\n \"It's not safe,\" Aurora replies, like that's a different thing. \"But it is safe. For now.\"\n\n She finally looks at you, a calm but purposeful expression on her face. \"I brought you here because it's real. And you've been needing something real.\"\n\n That lands harder than you expect.\n\n She rises to her feet, brushing dirt off her skirt, then looks out past the trees as if she's searching for something just beyond sight.\n\n \"I'm going to fix it,\" she adds, almost like a promise to herself. \"Or at least close it. Before someone stumbles into it and doesn't come back out.\"\n\n You glance down at the circle. Nothing moves. Nothing glows. And yet, you still feel like it's looking back at you.\n\n Aurora pulls an old, weathered pendant, a handful of dried herbs, and a silver pen with strange etching carved onto the side out of thin air. She begins setting them on the ground in quiet, deliberate motions.\n\n Whatever happens next, it's starting soon. And whether you're ready or not, you're a part of it now.\n\n \n You step closer to the circle.\n\n The earth inside the ring of stones is darker than the rest of the forest floor—not just in color, but in feel. It's not wet or muddy, but it looks rich and dense, like it's been untouched by time. Like it's been watching.\n\n You crouch beside it, careful not to disturb the stones, and peer closer.\n\n No markings. No obvious symbols. Just a perfectly round patch of soil framed by weathered rocks, each one different—some smooth, some rough, one with what looks like a faint burn mark across the surface.\n\n The closer you get, the more your skin hums.\n\n Not unpleasant or painful, just... aware. Like the static before a radio station tunes in. You don't know what you're picking up, but you know something's definitely there.\n\n You reach a hand out, hesitating just above the center. You don't touch it. You don't need to.\n\n You feel it.\n\n Something old. Something awake. You swear, for half a second, that the dirt pulses—just once, like a heartbeat under the surface. You pull your hand back instantly.\n\n Milo leans over your shoulder, whispering, \"Woah. Did you feel that too, [name]?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, nodding. \"It's... alive.\"\n\n Aurora's voice comes from just behind you. It's measured, like she's been waiting for you to see it for yourself.\n\n \"This place was left open a long time ago. By someone who didn't close it properly.\" She walks slowly around the edge of the circle, not stepping inside. \"It's not dangerous—not yet. But it is leaking.\"\n\n \"Leaking what?\" you ask, eyes still fixed on the dark soil.\n\n Aurora's lips curve into something almost like a smile. \"Possibility.\"\n\n \"That is not helpful.\"\n\n \"It's not supposed to be,\" she replies.\n\n Then, wordlessly, she kneels beside the circle and starts summoning tools out of thin air—an aged pendant, a bundle of dried herbs, and a silver pen.\n\n She places them carefully beside the stones, her fingers slow and precise, like she's done this before. Like every motion matters.\n\n The air gets still again.\n\n Something's coming. And you're part of it now.\n\n \n You take a slow step back from the circle, the hair on your arms still standing on end. There's no sound in this part of the woods. No birds, no breeze. Just that faint, oppressive hum. It's like the air itself is vibrating in some frequency you can't quite hear.\n\n You glance at Aurora.\n\n \"Okay, I gotta ask,\" you say, voice lower and more serious now. \"Is all of this actually safe? Like—should we really be standing here?\"\n\n Aurora doesn't look up right away. She's crouched at the edge of the stone rings, eyes scanning the pattern like it's shifting just slightly beneath the surface. Her fingers trace the dark soil, hovering just a breath above it.\n\n She finally responds, not with panic or fear—but with honesty.\n\n \"No,\" she says plainly. \"Not entirely.\"\n\n You freeze. Milo pauses mid-sketch, looking up like he was just now processing the full weight of that word.\n\n Aurora continues, calmly. \"Fixing it isn't risk-free. There are old currents running through places like this. It's like stitching closed something that wasn't meant to be open—sometimes the thread fights back.\"\n\n \"That's comforting,\" you mutter.\n\n She glances over at you, something like amusement flickering behind her eyes. \"But it's safe enough. I've done this before.\"\n\n \"You've closed one of these before?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n Aurora's smile is thin. \"Not exactly like this. But close enough.\"\n\n You want to ask what \"close enough\" actually means, but she's already moving.\n\n She pulls tools out of thin air. An old, weathered pendant, a handful of dried herbs, and a silver pen with strange etching. She sets them on the mossy ground with the kind of care usually reserved for delicate glass.\n \n Milo leans in, wide-eyed, whispering, \"It's happening, isn't it?\"\n\n Aurora doesn't answer. She just breathes in, readying herself for what's to happen.\n \n\n[Choice: Help Aurora]\n[Choice: Let Aurora handle it]",

      "text": "You don't wait for Aurora to ask. You don't even know if she will. You just step forward.\n\n She doesn't look surprised—if anything, there's a quiet flicker in her eyes as you crouch beside her at the edge of the circle. The pendant and herbs are already laid out. The silver pen still gleams faintly, catching the light like it's breathing.\n\n You glance at her. \"What do you need me to do?\"\n\n Aurora's voice is calm, even. \"You're going to help guide the energy. Mirror me. But don't try to control it. You're talented, but you're not there yet.\"\n\n \"Thanks for the vote of confidence,\" you say, chuckling.\n\n \"It is confidence,\" she states, placing a dried sprig of lavender in your hand. \"You're doing something most people would pass out trying.\"\n\n You don't know if that's encouraging or terrifying.\n\n Aurora begins moving, her hand tracing invisible lines above the circle's edge with the pen, speaking in a low, steady rhythm—an incantation that feels more felt than heard. You follow her lead, letting your fingers hover just above the dirt, the herb in your palm warming unnaturally fast.\n\n And then you feel it.\n\n Something tugging at the edge of your thoughts. It's a presence—not malevolent, but vast. It's a feeling you can't quite describe.\n\n Your breath catches. Your fingers tremble. For a second, the pull is too much, like it wants to pour straight through you and out the other side. You start to lose focus. Your thoughts start to fade.\n\n \"Ground yourself,\" Aurora says, her tone sharper now. \"Now, [name].\"\n\n You grit your teeth and press your hand into the earth beside the circle, steadying your breath. The pressure lessens just enough for you to fall back in step with her.\n\n The air hums again. This time it's around you, not through. The herbs start to burn softly at the corners, releasing a smoky smell that curls upward and dissolves into the stillness. You feel your pulse syncing to something bigger—something ancient, and not entirely distant.\n\n Aurora lifts the pendant, and you match her rhythm.\n\n The circle pulses once—then contracts. Not violently or loudly. Just a quiet collapse.\n\n And it's done.\n\n The soil inside the ring darkens. The stones settle. The weight lifts.\n\n You exhale, slowly, your body buzzing like it just ran a marathon through static. But you're standing. And Aurora?\n\n She lowers the pendant, breathes out through her nose, and gives a small nod.\n\n The two of you closed it.\n\n \n You watch Aurora move with the kind of practiced focus that makes everything she does feel ritualistic—like this isn't just a spell, it's a language you were never taught. The herbs, the pendant, and that glinting silver pen are arranged in a careful triangle around the circle, each placed with almost surgical precision. She doesn't rush.\n\n You glance at Milo, who's sitting cross-legged a few feet away, watching with wide eyes.\n\n You could offer to help. Could step forward, kneel beside her, ask what to do.\n\n But something about the way Aurora is moving—her posture, the set of her jaw, the way her eyes narrow just slightly as she kneels—tells you she's already deciding this is hers to handle.\n\n So you sit back.\n\n And let her.\n\n Aurora lowers the pendant into the center of the circle first, letting it rest on the soil with a near-silent thump. Her lips begin to move, too quiet to hear, the words falling into the dirt like rain.\n\n The herbs she scatters in short, sharp tosses—north, east, south, west. The scent of sage and lavender blooms strong, earthy and grounding. The forest itself seems to listen.\n\n And then—there's resistance.\n\n You see it hit her. Not all at once. More like a ripple beneath her skin. Her shoulders stiffen. Her fingers tremble for half a second before she locks them still.\n\n Milo tenses beside you, leaning in like he's watching a tightrope walker start to wobble.\n\n Aurora exhales hard through her nose, eyes fluttering closed, and you swear the edges of the circle shift. Like the stones are pressing against something invisible. Like the world is trying to close a door it forgot how to lock.\n\n Her voice rises now, firm and commanding. She holds the pendant high in one hand, the pen still moving in the other, the air practically buzzing around her. The circle begins to pulse—slow, dim flashes in the soil, like heat lightning under the ground.\n\n Then her nose bleeds.\n\n It's sudden—a thin red line slipping from one nostril, trailing down her upper lip. She doesn't notice right away. Or maybe she does and just doesn't care. Her eyes are locked on the pendant, her jaw clenched, her hand still drawing in the air with painful precision.\n\n You sit frozen, unsure if stepping in would help or ruin everything.\n\n Finally, with one last whispered phrase and a sharp, downward slash of the pen—\n\n It ends.\n\n The air lets go of you.\n\n The humming stops.\n\n The pressure in your chest eases, like something exhaled all at once. The soil in the circle darkens slightly, no longer pulsing, no longer... aware.\n\n It's just dirt now.\n\n Aurora's arm drops. The pendant clatters softly to the ground. She stays kneeling, head bowed, one hand braced against the earth, the other wiping the blood from under her nose with the back of her sleeve.\n\n She doesn't speak.\n\n Not yet.\n\n But the wound is closed. And she did it all by herself.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Point is, you helped stabilize it.\"\n\n Milo, wide-eyed and now several pages deep into sketching the circle from memory, lets out a low whistle. \"Dude. You glowed.\"\n\n You didn't. Probably. But your fingers are still warm, and your heartbeat hasn't quite come down yet.\n\n Aurora gathers the tool carefully, her movements slower now, but not strained. She grips the pen and the pendant with a quiet reverence.\n\n Then she straightens, brushing the dirt from her skirt.\n\n \"We should go,\" she says. \"There's time before the bell, and I need to rebind the tools before the energy settles too far.\"\n\n You glance back once more at the now-silent circle of earth.\n\n Whatever it was, you helped seal it.\n\n It wasn't perfect, and it definitely wasn't clean.\n\n But you did it. Together.\n\n And something inside you knows—you could do more.\n\n One day.\n\n \n The silence after the ritual feels loud.\n\n The forest is still again—actually still this time. No hum, no pulse, no unseen weight pressing against your ribcage. Just the sound of your own breath, and the faint rustle of wind through leaves that suddenly remember how to move.\n\n Aurora stays kneeling, her head bowed, one hand braced on the ground like she's anchoring herself. The other trembles slightly as it wipes the streak of blood from under her nose with a practiced sort of grace, like this isn't the first time she's pushed herself so far.\n\n Milo scrambles toward her the second the circle fades. \"Aurora—hey—are you okay? That was like—actual blood. That's not, like, supposed to happen, right?\"\n\n He drops to one knee beside her, wide-eyed, one hand hovering like he wants to help but doesn't quite know how to. \"Do you need water? Bandages? A trauma blanket? I don't have one, but I could find one—probably—\"\n\n Aurora holds up a hand, still breathing hard. \"I'm fine.\"\n\n \"Aurora, you are not fine,\" Milo blurts. \"You bled out of your face, and you look like you're about to fall over.\"\n\n She exhales slowly, finally pushing herself upright with a small wince. \"It's just feedback. The circle was more resistant than I expected.\" She glances at you briefly. Just enough to acknowledge your presence. \"But it's closed now. That's what matters.\"\n\n You nod, still watching her carefully. She's steadier now. No shake in her voice. No panic.\n\n Still, Milo hovers like she might dissolve into smoke if he looks away for too long.\n\n Aurora adjusts her skirt, grips the silver pen and pendant, and finally stands fully. She brushes the dirt from her knees and turns back toward the trail.\n\n \"We should return to the club room,\" she says simply, already starting to walk. \"There's time before the bell, and I need to rebind the tools before the energy settles too far.\"\n\n Milo shoots you a look that's 20% worry, 80% confusion, but he doesn't argue. He just jogs to catch up with her, still talking rapid-fire about magical safety protocol and maybe making an emergency kit.\n\n You glance back at the circle one last time—now just a patch of oddly dark soil in an ordinary clearing.\n\n No hum. No pulse.\n\n Whatever it was... it's gone.\n\n Aurora made sure of that.\n\n And now you follow her, back through the brush, toward the school. Toward normal.\n \n\n[Choice: Get back to the club room]",

But now, under the hum of the flickering fluorescent lights and the faint scent of incense that never really fades from the carpet, it's like stepping out of a dream.\n\n The only thing that feels different is you.\n\n She summons the used tools, grabbing them out of nowhere, and begins quietly sorting through them. The herbs are now brittle and half-burned. The pendant, faintly warm. The pen, still gleaming.\n\n There's no weakness, because she didn't do it alone.\n\n Milo is bouncing beside the desk, practically vibrating with leftover adrenaline. \"Okay, that was insane,\" he says, wide-eyed. \"You were glowing. I swear you were glowing. Both of you. It was like some Sailor Moon team-up, but way moodier.\"\n\n Aurora doesn't respond right away. She finishes sorting, then sits cross-legged on the rug like she's centering herself.\n\n \"The threshold is sealed,\" she says steadily. \"No rift. No pull. It's quiet now.\"\n\n Milo flops down dramatically next to the bookshelf. \"Okay, but, uh—what was it? Just a... hole in the world?\"\n\n Aurora nods. \"A fracture. Not a doorway. But it could have become one.\" She looks at you then—eyes unreadable, voice softer. \"It responded to both of us. That's rare.\"\n\n You sit on the edge of the rug, fingers still tingling slightly. You don't say it out loud, but the magic felt like it recognized you. Like it knew you could carry some of its weight, even if just for a moment.\n\n You glance over. \"So... we're good? It's done?\"\n\n Aurora picks up the pendant again, running her thumb over its edge. \"It's quiet now,\" she repeats. \"That's enough for today.\"\n\n Milo stretches out on the floor. \"Man. Other clubs just hand out stickers or talk about anime. We're out here preventing magical trauma vortexes.\"\n\n Aurora lifts an eyebrow. \"We're doing this to protect them.\"\n\n Milo just sighs dramatically. \"That's fair.\"\n\n The bell rings—sharp and shrill, pulling you all back to the reality that you're still, somehow, in high school. That lunch is next, and there's probably mystery meat waiting for you in the cafeteria.\n\n Aurora stands, brushing a faint bit of dirt off her skirt. She turns to you one last time, her voice a little softer than usual.\n\n \"You did well today,\" she says. \"You're strong.\"\n\n You meet her eyes, and for once, she isn't being cryptic. She means it.\n\n She blows out the final candle, and the flame dies with a soft puff of smoke curling toward the ceiling.\n\n \n Back in the club, the shift in atmosphere is immediate.\n\n The strange quiet of the forest, the static hum of the circle, the gravity of the clearing—it all fades the second the second the door clicks shut behind you. You're back in the mysterious room with flickering fluorescent lights, dusty shelves, and mystic artifacts.\n\n Aurora moves with a slow but steady calm, moving slower than usual as she sits at her usual spot on the rug. She doesn't speak right away. She just sits.\n\n Milo, on the other hand, is a tornado of concern. He's already cleared a spot in front of her, digging out a half-crushed granola bar and a bottle of water like he's a nurse.\n\n \"Are you sure you're okay?\" he says for the third time, crouching beside her. \"Because, like, that nosebleed thing? That wasn't chill. That was scary. It would be what you feel if you did reverse meditation.\"\n\n Aurora gives him a faint, amused glance. \"I'm fine, Milo. That kind of feedback was expected.\"\n\n He looks unconvinced, hovering with the water bottle. \"Expected doesn't mean good, Aurora.\"\n\n You linger near the desk, watching her carefully. She doesn't look as tired anymore, but she's quieter than usual. It's like she's still calculating something behind her eyes.\n\n Finally, she speaks. \"The threshold is sealed—for now.\"\n\n Milo leans forward, eyes wide. \"So it was a threshold. I knew it! You could feel it humming.\"\n\n She nods. \"It wasn't an open gate, but it was fractured. Bleeding energy. Enough to attract attention, eventually.\"\n\n \"What attention?\" you ask, swallowing.\n\n Aurora looks at you directly. \"Things that like to crawl through cracks.\"\n\n Milo lets out a small, nervous laugh and mutters, \"Okay, yeah, cool, I'm sleeping with the lights on tonight.\"\n\n She summons the used tools, grabbing them out of nowhere, and begins quietly sorting through them. The herbs are now brittle and half-burned. The pendant, faintly warm. The pen, still gleaming.\n\n \"I'll reinforce it later,\" Aurora says. \"It won't hold forever, but it's quiet again. That's enough for now.\"\n\n The room falls silent for a moment—still, focused.\n\n Then the bell rings, high and sharp through the walls, jolting you all back to the fact that, yes, this is still technically an extracurricular club at a public high school.\n\n Milo sighs. \"Man. No one else's club is like this. The photography club just takes pictures of squirrels and eats muffins.\"\n\n Aurora rises, smoothing her skirt. \"Then they are woefully unprepared for the apocalypse.\"\n\n She gives you one last thoughtful look.\n\n \"Thank you for coming today,\" she says simply, then turns to blow out the last candle.\n\n And just like that, the moment is over.\n \n\nClub's out. The threshold is closed. And the world is, for now, still.\n\n[Choice: Go to lunch]",

It's part-time, since we know a lot of people working here are high school or college students.\"\n\nShe flips to another page, scanning it quickly. \"We're mostly looking for weekend help right now. Maybe four or five-hour shifts, depending on how busy it gets. We're flexible around school schedules as long as you show up when say you will.\"\n\nYou nod slowly, absorbing.\n\n\"Actually, we could really use someone tonight,\" she adds, glancing at the clock behind her. \"A few people bailed last minute, and the clothing section's a mess after the afternoon rush.\"\n\nShe leans on the counter, lowering her voice into something almost pleading. \"Just a few hours. Three, max. After that, it would just be weekends unless you wanted to pick up extra shifts.\"\n\nYou glance toward the entrance of one of the bigger clothing stores—Threadz—where a teenager is trying to restock a table of jeans while a swarm of middle schoolers dismantle a rack of jackets two feet away.\n\nIt doesn't look that bad.

They sell clothes for everyone—guys, girls, whoever—lots of casual stuff, some dressier options, accessories, all that.\"\n\nYou glance toward the store as she speaks.

A digital screen inside flashes rotating images of smiling teens and young adults posing in streetwear.\n\nIt looks... cool.\n\nIntimidating, maybe, but cool.\n\nThe woman must see the hesitation flicker across your face because she leans in a little, offering a reassuring smile. \"Don't worry about fitting into some crazy fashion vibe or anything,\" she says. \"The manager there—Kendra—she's super chill. She's the type who wears ripped jeans to meetings. Real easygoing. As long as you're responsible, she won't be breathing down your neck.\"\n\nYou relax a little, feeling the edge of nerves ease off.

There's a sticky note that says \"GET CHARLOTTE COFFEE OR SHE'LL BITE\" on the door that wasn't there last week.\n\n<<if [jordanRelo] > 29>> \n You step in and Jordan's already there—seated in the far corner with his arms crossed and that permanent look of annoyance etched on his face. He doesn't look up right away, but you catch the twitch of recognition when you enter.\n\n \"Hey,\" you say.\n\n He glances at you, then at something he's sketching, then back at you. There's a faint curve to his mouth—not quite a smile, but close to it.\n\n \"You're late,\" he says, but there's no bite to it.\n\n You check the clock. \"I'm literally two minutes early.\"\n\n \"I was earlier,\" he says, and there's a flicker of something behind the words. Like maybe he waited.\n\n He goes back to his notes, but there's a tiny pause in his pen. If you didn't know any better, you'd say he's waiting for you to sit down beside him.\n\n Maybe the seat next to him was never supposed to stay empty.\n<<elseif [jordanRelo] > 14>> \n You step into the yearbook room, and Jordan's already there—posted up in the corner like he's guarding something, jaw tight in a way that makes him look like he's always mid-argument.\n\n He doesn't look up at first, just keeps sketching something, fingers tapping against the side of his knee.\n\n \"Hey,\" you offer.\n\n His eyes flick toward you for half a second, then back to the page. \"Hey.\"\n\n No smile. No warmth. But not dismissive, either. Just... neutral. Guarded, like always.\n\n You slide into a seat a couple of chairs over—not next to him, exactly, but not far either. He doesn't shift or react, but his tapping slows down just slightly. His eyes drift sideways for a heartbeat. Then his pencil starts again.\n\n If he cares that you're here, he doesn't show it. But now that you think about it, if he didn't care at all, he probably wouldn't have noticed you walk in.\n\n \n You step into the yearbook room, and Jordan's already there—sitting in a back corner with his arms crossed, a notebook in front of him, and an expression like he's tired of everyone and everything.\n\n He doesn't look up when you enter. Doesn't acknowledge you at all, really.\n\n You hesitate for half a second before finding an open seat a few spots away. Close enough to work together if you have to. Not close enough to feel like you're inviting conversation.\n\n You glance over once. He's scribbling something in tight, sharp strokes, his jaw set.\n\n If he knows you're here, he gives no sign of it. And honestly? You're not sure what you'd say anyway.\n \n\nThe class slowly fills up, but there's still no sign of the Yearbook Club's leader. The bell rings and the door swings open just as you're starting to get concerned, and Charlotte bursts into the room, half-jogging, her messenger bag flopping against her hip and a water bottle clutched in one hand.\n\n\"Okay, okay—sorry I'm late!\" she says, breathless but smiling. \"I swear the vote from the last club block was down to the wire, and I wanted to make sure I counted right.\"\n\nShe drops her bag onto the nearest chair, pulls out a clipboard with many tallies, and dramatically fans herself with a laminated piece of paper.\n\n\"Y'all really couldn't make this easy, huh?\"\n\nThere's a murmur of low laughter around the room. Jordan doesn't look up, but his pen pauses.\n\nCharlotte grins, scanning the group. \"Alright. You ready to find out which yearbook theme took the crown?\"\n\nShe pauses. Just for drama.\n\n \"A School Odyssey took it,\" she announces, loud and proud. \"By one vote. Literally one.\"\n\n There's a small ripple of reactions—someone near the window pumps their fist, another groans theatrically, and one of the girls in the front mutters something about how sci-fi is really boring. Charlotte ignores the chaos and powers on.\n\n \"So. Get ready for chrome gradients, glowing borders, digital font families, and a whole lot of fake data overlays. It's going to look like our lives are being broadcast from the inside of a space shuttle.\"\n\n She flips through her notes.\n\n \"I want transitions that feel like loading screens, portraits with scanner-bar effects, and captions formatted like glitchy interface logs.\"\n\n Charlotte raises her water bottle like a toast. \"Time to build the yearbook of the future, nerds.\"\n\n And just like that, the room kicks into motion.\n\n \"Through the Lens wins it,\" she announces, loud and proud. \"Barely, by the way. It was a one-vote difference.\"\n\n There's a small cheer from a few students. Jordan, unsurprisingly, doesn't react much, but his pen stops mid-markup for half a second.\n\n Charlotte keeps going, already turning to the whiteboard.\n\n \"So here's what that means: we're focusing on moments. And I mean the real ones. The unplanned smiles, the hallway chaos, the way Ms. Palmer always forgets her coffee on the roof of her car. Snapshots of actual lives, not just poses.\"\n\n She pops the cap off an Expo marker and draws a rough layout outline on the board.\n\n \"Each section will feel like you're flipping through someone's camera roll.\"\n\n She pauses, then turns to face the room.\n\n \"We're telling stories this year. No filters. Just truth.\"\n\n A few people nod. Even Jordan... almost smiles. Almost.\n\n Charlotte lifts her water bottle like a toast. \"Let's make this yearbook feel like us. Not the polished version, but the real thing.\"\n\n And with that, everyone starts moving, ideas already flying.\n\n \"Alright, folks—Timeless Traditions takes the win. It was close, literally one vote, but y'all clearly love nostalgia.\"\n\n A few students let out small cheers; someone pretends to sob into their sleeves like they had just won a gold medal. Jordan doesn't move, but his posture relaxes a little. He probably voted for it.\n\n Charlotte spins toward the whiteboard, already uncapping an Expo marker. \"So here's what this all means: we're reading into heritage. Every page should feel like you're flipping through the best parts of a scrapbook. Old photos, fun facts, class memories. We'll be mixing in black-and-white elements, retro borders, maybe even some notes or doodles.\"\n\n She begins sketching a layout with bold headline spaces, layered photo stacks, and sidebar timelines.\n\n \"This is a tribute to Pacific Crest—not just the buildings, but the people. The chaos. The weird traditions we pretend to hate but would totally miss if they vanished.\"\n\n Charlotte turns back to the group and lifts her water bottle like a toast. \"Let's make a yearbook that feels like opening a time capsule!\"\n\n And with that, the room kicks into gear. Pens tap, laptops open, and the past starts taking shape.\n\n \n You either cheated or broke something.\n \n\n[Choice: Yearbook Club begin!]",

I trust you three to get me usable photos, which puts you ahead of most people.

Instead, he just huffs quietly, leaning back in his chair and tapping his pencil against the table once.\n\n \"Figures she'd stick us together again.\"\n\n He says it like he's complaining, but there's no real bite behind it. Just the usual energy he carries when he's around you—familiar and begrudgingly fond.\n\n You shrug, playing along. \"Guess you're stuck with me.\"\n\n Jordan smirks, just barely. \"Could be worse.\"\n\n You catch the faint smile he tries to bury by flipping through his notebook again. He doesn't say anything else, but the fact that he doesn't immediately shut down the conversation says enough.\n\n He's not fighting it.\n\n Not when it's you.\n<<elseif [jordanRelo] > 14>> \n Jordan gives you a brief glance—measured, unreadable.\n\n He doesn't say anything at first. Just taps his pencil against the corner of his notebook a few times before looking back down like you're just another assignment he has to deal with.\n\n \"Whatever,\" he mutters, almost more to himself than to you.\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Good to see you're thrilled.\"\n\n He shrugs without looking at you. \"As long as you don't screw it up, I don't care.\"\n\n It's not hostile—just distant. He's keeping you at arm's length. It's like this is just another thing to get through. And to him, you're nothing special.\n\n \n For a second, he barely seems to register you. When he does, he taps his pencil against his notebook, then mutters, \"Great.\"\n\n The word sounds anything but.\n\n You fold your arms. \"Well, it's nice to see you too.\"\n\n Jordan doesn't respond. He just goes back to his notes like the conversation's already over, shutting the door on anything more before it can even stop.\n\n You're not exactly surprised.

It's time to work.\n\n Simon hovers next to you, looking around like he's hoping someone will suddenly start doing something artistic and profound.\n\n \"Simon, just... start snapping,\" you whisper. \"Candid stuff.

It has natural lighting and genuine despair.\"\n\n You snort quietly and snap the picture, catching a perfect shot of two students arguing over whether or not The Emoji Movie qualifies as a postmodernist satire.

He looks like he's trying to compose a National Geographic spread or something. Too bad all he has to work with is Film Club.\"\n\n You snort. \"I mean, it all started going downhill the second someone greenlit this movie.\"\n\n She leans back dramatically, arms stretched out over the backs of the chairs. \"You joke, but this?\"—she gestures broadly at the shit unfolding around the room—\"this is the purest form of cinema appreciation.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Seriously?\"\n\n She nods solemnly. \"No papers to write. No debates about staging. Just vibes, popcorn, and the slow death of dignity. This is what film is really about. You just don't get it.\"\n\n You laugh. \"Samantha, you may just be the worst critic I've ever met.\"\n\n \"And yet,\" she says, popping a handful of Skittles in her mouth, \"you keep sitting next to me.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but don't move. It's kind of hard to argue with Samantha's logic here.\n\n Simon, meanwhile, is still trying to take a respectable photo while someone throws popcorn at him from behind a beanbag chair. Jordan hasn't even moved from his spot by the door, arms crossed so tightly that he might just snap.\n\n Maybe this isn't exactly prestige cinema. But despite all that, it's weirdly perfect.\n\n \n \n You lower the camera a little and give it to Simon, who looks overwhelmed but determined. it's probably safer to let him handle it for now.\n\n Instead, you drift toward where Jordan is standing stiffly near the door, arms crossed so tightly he might cut off his own circulation.\n\n <<if [jordanRelo] > 29>> \n You stop next to him and bump your shoulder lightly against his.\n\n \"How's the cinematic masterpiece treating you?\"\n\n Jordan huffs out a breath that's almost a laugh.\n\n \"It's a crime against humanity,\" he mutters.\n\n You grin. \"Come on, you're telling me you wouldn't clap whenever the poop emoji is on screen?\"\n\n He finally glances at you, eyes narrowed but a little more alive than they were a second ago.\n\n \"[name], if I ever clap for this, assume the worst has happened.\"\n\n You snort and lean casually on the wall against him, close enough that your shoulders nearly brush.\n\n He doesn't pull away.\n\n You knew he wouldn't.\n\n For a moment, you both stand there, shoulder to shoulder, silently judging the room together.\n\n Jordan shifts slightly, lowering his arms, a little less tense now.\n\n \"It could be worse,\" he mutters. \"At least you're here.\"\n\n He says it so low you almost miss it. But luckily you don't. And you don't point it out, either. You just let it hang there, warm and quiet between you.\n <<elseif [jordanRelo] > 14>> \n You stop a few feet away and nudge him lightly.\n\n \"You doing okay over here?\"\n\n Jordan doesn't look at you right away, but he doesn't ignore you either. He lets out a low breath through his nose, somewhere between a sigh and a grunt.\n\n \"This is brutal,\" he mutters, still watching the chaos unfold. \"I feel like I'm losing brain cells just by being in this room.\"\n\n You smirk. \"Come on, it's a masterpiece. Pure and raw cinematic suffering.\"\n\n That earns the tiniest twitch at the corner of his mouth—a reaction so small you almost miss it.\n\n \"Yeah, well,\" he says, voice low, \"next time, you're sitting through this alone.\"\n\n It's dry, almost teasing. You decide to take it as a minor victory.\n\n You settle into a spot next to him without really thinking about it. It's not a deep conversation, but Jordan doesn't move away. And somehow, that says enough for now.\n \n \n You stop a few feet away. \"You surviving over there?\" you ask, half-joking.\n\n Jordan doesn't even glance at you. He just stares straight ahead at the chaotic room like he's waiting for something to happen so he has an excuse to leave.\n\n \"Fine,\" he says shortly.\n\n You shift awkwardly. \"Film Club's not exactly what you expected, huh?\"\n\n \"Didn't expect much,\" he mutters, voice low. \"Still disappointed.\"\n\n You let out a dry chuckle, but it dies quickly when Jordan gives you a sharp look. It's clear he's not in the mood to chat.\n\n Honestly, you're not even sure if he's in the mood to exist in the same room as The Emoji Movie.\n\n You shove your hands in your pockets and lean back against the wall, keeping a respectful distance.\n \n Not every teammate has to be a friend.

Jordan follows silently behind, hands shoved deep in his pockets.\n\nNext stop: Sports Club.\n\nYou push open the double doors to the gym, and the instant you step inside, you're hit with the sharp echoing sounds of sneakers squeaking against polished wood, dodgeballs smacking walls, and someone yelling across the court.\n\nLuke spots you almost immediately. He's in the middle of a game, decked out in athletic shorts and a T-shirt, grinning like a dog who just found out he's getting two dinners tonight.\n\n\"Ayy, [name]!\" he bellows, loud enough that half the gym turns to stare.\n\nYou give him a quick wave, trying not to laugh. Simon cringes a little beside you like he's not built for this much raw athletic energy.\n\nJordan, on the other hand, just mutters, \"Kill me now,\" under his breath.\n\nLuke jogs over to the sidelines, catching a dodgeball one-handed on the way without even glancing at it. He's a little sweaty, a little scuffed up, and somehow thriving.\n\n\"You here for photos?\" Luke asks, bright-eyed.\n\n\"Yeah,\" you say, lifting the camera. \"Don't worry, I'll make you look like a professional athlete. Even if you appear to be a maniac right now.\"\n\nLuke beams. \"Just don't expect anything on my end!\"\n\nBefore you can respond, a rogue dodgeball flies past his head and nails the wall next to you with a loud thud. Luke doesn't even flinch—he just throws a lazy peace sign back at whoever threw it and grins wider.\n\nYou take a few quick shots—Luke posing with a ball over his shoulder, a group mid-throw, and the intensity when there are only a few players left on the court. It's chaotic as all hell, and honestly a lot more fun to capture than you expected.\n\nSimon, meanwhile, flinches before edging a little further behind you every time a dodgeball whizzes too close. Jordan leans against the bleachers, arms crossed, staring at the ceiling like he's counting down the seconds until he can leave.\n\nAfter a dozen or so minutes, Charlotte's checklist is mostly satisfied—candids, action shots, one or two blurry pictures that still have vibes.\n\nYou check the time and glance at Simon and Jordan.\n\n\"Alright,\" you say. \"Let's get out of here.\"\n\nLuke throws you a thumbs-up before diving back into the game like his life depends on it.\n\nYou shake your head, smiling despite yourself, and head for the door.\n\n[Choice: Get back to class]",

Simon's still buzzing a little from the chaos of Film Club, while Jordan walks silently, the only sound from him the steady rhythm of his sneakers hitting the floor.\n\nWhen you finally push open the door to the Yearbook Club room, Charlotte looks up from her laptop, a half-eaten granola bar hanging out of her mouth.\n\n\"Survivors have returned,\" she says, muffled but triumphant. \"Good. Return the camera to the bin and upload the shots by tomorrow.\"\n\nSimon gives a tired salute and practically collapses into a chair to start the upload. You unclip the camera strap from around your neck and follow suit, feeling the comfortable weight of being finished settle onto your shoulders.\n\nJordan hangs back by the door with his arms crossed, watching but not rushing you.\n\nCharlotte taps away at her laptop. \"You guys did a really nice job, by the way. You actually got usable photos, which puts you ahead of most of the photographers I've gone through.\";\n\nYou snort. Simon beams. Jordan... shrugs.\n\nAfter a few more minutes of housekeeping—reminders about deadlines, layout brainstorming, and an ominous warning about what happens if anyone turns in photos with timestamps—you're finally free to go.\n\nYou shoulder your bag and glance toward Jordan, who's lingering by the door.\n\n<<if [jordanRelo] > 49>> \n He glances at you as you gather your things, and his gaze lingers for a while.\n\n He shifts his weight from one foot to the other before speaking. \"Hey, [name], you did good today,\" he starts, voice a little rougher than usual. \"Not just with the photos.\"\n\n There's a pause—like he's second-guessing saying anything at all—but then he just pushes forward.\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow, okay?\"\n\n This time, his voice is a little softer and less guarded.\n\n He gives you a small, almost shy half-smile and lifts two fingers in a lazy half-wave before turning to leave.\n\n You watch him go, and despite yourself, feel a warmth settle low in your chest.\n<<elseif [jordanRelo] > 29>> \n Jordan glances at you, a little longer than necessary, then jerks his chin toward the hall.\n\n \"Later, [name],\" he says, voice low but not cold.\n\n There's a pause afterward, like he wants to say more, but then he just gives a quick nod before slipping out the door.\n\n It's casual, sure, but it sticks with you anyway.\n<<elseif [jordanRelo] > 14>> \n Jordan gives you a brief look, impassive as ever.\n\n \"Later,\" he mutters, barely above a grumble, and pushes open the door without waiting for a response.\n\n It's not friendly. It's just... Jordan. Keeping people at arm's length, like always.\n\n \n Jordan doesn't really look at you at all.\n\n He just leaves without saying a word.\n\n You're just two people who happened to get grouped together, after all.\n \n\n[Choice: Go to lunch]",

      "text": "Text Nobody Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n You stare at your phone a second longer, thumb hovering just above the screen. No new notifications. No pings. Just the quiet glow of the lock screen and your own reflection faint in the glass.\n\n You could text someone. You could reach out. But the weight in your chest isn't heavy—it's just still. Like the day's folded itself neatly and is waiting to be set down.\n\n You turn your phone off and toss it on the nightstand. It misses by a few inches and lands face-down on the bed, but you don't bother fixing it.\n\n \n You scroll up, rereading the short conversation that just occurred. What happened is clear, though—it fizzled out before it even really started. You stare at it for a second longer, thumb hovering, then pull it back.\n\n You turn off your phone. The screen goes black, and the room feels just a little heavier. The quiet presses in—not comforting, just... still.\n\n \n The last bubble of text hangs on your screen, soft blue against the dim glow of your bedroom. The conversation has slowed, the back-and-forth tapering off like the end of a good song. You reread the last message once or twice, thumb hovering as if debating a reply—but there's nothing else that needs saying. Not tonight, anyway.\n\n You turn your phone off with a soft click. The room goes darker. You shift, letting yourself settle into the mattress, the hum of quiet wrapping around you.\n \n\nYou pull the covers up, the cool sheets brushing against your legs as you shift to get comfortable. The room hums with that low, late-night quiet—the kind that settles deep and asks nothing of you.\n\n \n You glance over at your goat plushie, slouched against the pillow like he owns the place. You grab him and pull him close, fingers brushing his fuzzy little horns. He's a dopey-looking thing, all lopsided, and you can't help but smile as you squeeze him gently. One of his legs sticks out at a weird angle, and you nudge it back like you're tucking him in. \"[goatplushieName],\" you whisper, almost like a roll call, and set him against your chest. It's quiet now, just you and him. Something about having him there—goofy and soft—makes the night feel easier.\n\n \n You reach out toward the nightstand, where your new meerkat plushie sits propped up like he's been waiting all day. You scoop him up without thinking, pressing him close to your chest. His tiny paws flop a little, his stitched eyes peeking up at you like he knows something you don't. You nudge his snout with your finger, muttering some nonsense under your breath like you're both in on a joke. It's silly and childish, but the way it fits against your arms feels right. You whisper the name you gave it once, [meerkatplushieName], and let it rest beside you.\n\n \n You reach over and grab the bee plushie from where he's nestled by your pillow, his stubby little wings sticking out like he's mid-flight. He's round and squishy, with a tiny embroidered smile and little felt antennae that you swear twitched under your fingers. You give him a light squeeze and murmur, \"[beeplushieName],\" under your breath. He fits perfectly in your arms, warm and familiar in that silly way only a stuffed bee can be.\n\n \n Your thoughts wander—not to anything you bought for yourself, but to the fox plushie now sitting on your mom's nightstand. The one with the patchy ear, its fur soft from age and love. You wonder if she smiled when she set it down. If she gave it a little pat goodnight, or maybe even whispered something to it, just because. You hope she likes it. You really do. Something about the thought settles warm and low in your chest, like you gave her something that really did mean a lot.\n\n \n Your thoughts drift—not to the shoes or accessories or any of the things you picked out for yourself, but to the red panda plush now resting on Lily's bed. Mochi. The one with the round ears, sleepy face, and little stitched paws. You picture her setting it down right before collapsing into bed, maybe giving it a quick squeeze or tucking it against her pillow. You hope she likes it. You really do. Maybe giving her that plushie meant more than just a cute gift. Maybe it said something you weren't always good at saying out loud.\n\n \n [plushieName]'s already on the bed, sitting just off-center on your pillow like he didn't want to assume you'd want him close. His little stitched eyes catch the moonlight, dull and waiting. You didn't bring anyone new home tonight—no smug goat, no cheerful meerkat, no wide-eyed bee. That, for whatever reason, makes the room feel heavier. [plushieName] doesn't say anything, can't say anything, but he looks a little smaller than usual. Like maybe he thought today was the day he'd get a new friend to sit beside. You lie down next to him, feeling the soft press of his faded plush against your shoulder. It takes you a second before you whisper, \"Sorry.\" His silence says it's okay. But it also says he's lonely.\n\n \n The bed swallows you whole tonight. It's too quiet, too cold, too empty. There's no plushie waiting to curl against your side, no stitched smile meeting you halfway, no soft weight to pretend the silence isn't closing in. You never picked one. And now there's nothing. You curl in tighter, but it doesn't help. There's nothing to hold but yourself.\n \n\nYour thoughts wander, soft and loose. Nothing sharp. Just images: someone laughing. Your own reflection in the mirror. A shopping bag. The weight of something warm in your hands. A faint, feminine voice. The feeling of being seen.\n\nThen the thoughts blur, your body softens, and sleep begins to fold itself around you.\n\nYou don't dream right away. You just rest.\n\n[Choice: Friday tomorrow!]",

Tucked between a cracked snow globe and a roll of tape.\n\n The Creeper.\n\n A tiny, plastic Creeper action figure from the game Blockscape. It's definitely from a Clancy's Joyous Meal. You don't even remember getting it—maybe someone gave it to you as a joke years ago—but somehow it's survived multiple cleanings, two room rearrangements, and a mysterious month in your backpack without breaking.\n\n It's ridiculous. And also... kind of perfect.\n\n You pluck it from the shelf and turn it over in your hand. The plastic is faded just enough to make it look like it's been through many battles. Its blocky body and head remain weirdly charming and a little nostalgic.\n\n \"Yeah, alright,\" you say out loud, tossing it a grin. \"You're coming with me.\"\n\n You grab your backpack, unzip the front pocket, and slide the Creeper in carefully, making sure he's upright and ready for his day of being a desk mascot. He fits perfectly, like he's ready to explode at the slightest inconvenience.\n\n You sling your backpack over your shoulders and head toward the door, your new \"pet\" safely packed and ready to silently threaten your homework with doom.\n\n \n Your eyes drift across your desk, shelves, and the top of your closet, trying to decide which object deserves the honor of sitting beside you during class.\n\n That's when you spot it.\n\n Half-buried under a notebook, peeking out just enough to catch the light with its unnerving, painted-on eyes.\n\n The clown duck.\n\n It's a rubber duck, sure. But it's not just any rubber duck. This one has a curly red wig sculpted from plastic, a painted-on white face with a huge smile, and a ruffled collar molded around its neck. The thing honks with the slightest bit of pressure, and it radiates a certain energy you can't quite describe.\n\n You honestly don't remember where it came from. A Halloween clearance bin? A gift from Samantha? A fever dream?\n\n All you know is it's been sitting in your room for years and somehow feels too powerful to throw away.\n\n You pick it up and stare into its eyes.\n\n It stares back.\n\n \"...You'll do,\" you mutter, almost reluctantly.\n\n You give it a quick wipe and then gingerly place it in the front pocket of your backpack. Its little face pokes out, and you can tell that it's definitely plotting something. You zip the bag halfway shut. There's no need to traumatize anyone.\n\n You grab your bag, adjust the straps, and head for the door—ready to unleash clown chaos on Pacific Crest High.\n\n \n You're halfway through rejecting a number of options—too weird, too childish, too haunted—when your eyes land on something soft, round, and familiar sitting right at the foot of your bed.\n\n [plushieName].\n\n The little panda plushie you bought two weeks ago at the mall. You've told yourself at the time it was just a silly impulse buy, a bit of retail therapy. But you've kept him propped against your pillow ever since.\n\n He's small enough to fit in your hand, with fuzzy fur and big, shiny eyes. One of his ears is now permanently bent slightly forward—probably from the time you used him as a pillow.\n\n You pick him up without thinking and squeeze him once.\n\n Still soft. Still oddly comforting.\n\n You smile, a little more to yourself than to him. \"You're up, buddy. Time to see the world outside of this room.\"\n\n He doesn't reply, of course. But in your head, you imagine him sighing dramatically, ready to face the chaos of Pacific Crest High alongside you.\n\n You grab your backpack and gently nestle [plushieName] into the main compartment, carefully leaving his head sticking out just enough to breathe. Well... he doesn't really need to breathe, but still. You need to show respect.\n\n There's something kind of nice about bringing him today. Not as a joke or to make a statement, but just because he's yours.\n\n The morning light spills in from the window, warm and steady. You sling your bag over your shoulders and head for the door, [plushieName] riding behind you.\n\n \n You scan your room with a growing sense of dread. Plushies, action figures, novelty erasers—somehow, none of them feel right for Desk Pet Day. You want something memorable. Something that screams insanity.\n\n And then your eyes land on it.\n\n The Furby.\n\n It sits high on your bookshelf, nestled between a dusty trophy from elementary school and an old lava lamp. Its once-white fur is now a little gray with age, its beak permanently parted in a haunting smile, and its electronic eyes—big, glassy, and vaguely unsettling—glint in the morning sun like it knows you're looking at it.\n\n You don't remember the last time you turned it on, although that's probably for the best. But it's survived for years now, including that one time you tried to donate it before changing your mind at the last second.\n\n You slowly reach up and take it down, cradling it like a fragile artifact.\n\n \"Alright, nightmare creature,\" you murmur. \"Let's go haunt a few classrooms.\"\n\n You briefly debate whether to pull out the batteries before bringing it—just in case—but decide against it. If it starts talking in the middle of class, that's between you and fate.\n\n You tuck the Furby into the front pocket of your backpack. It fits surprisingly well, its ears sticking out at weird angles and its beady eyes staring blankly out into the room.\n\n It looks both horrifying and perfect.\n\n You take one last glance at yourself in the mirror and see the cursed gremlin in your bag.\n\n All ready.\n\n \n You stare at the school notification on your phone for a while, rereading the words \"Desk Pet Day\" like they might make more sense the tenth time.\n\n They don't.\n\n You glance around your room—at the stuffed animals, toys, and weird little knickknacks scattered about. Some of them make you smile. Some just remind you how much you've changed. None of them feel like the right thing to pack.\n\n You sigh and toss your phone face-down onto your bed.\n\n Maybe it's the pressure to be clever about it. Maybe it's the idea of walking into class and pulling out a plushie. Maybe it's just that you're tired today.\n\n Whatever it is, the thought of participating just... doesn't appeal to you.\n\n You zip up your backpack without adding anything extra and swing it over your shoulder. There's a small, dull pang of guilt—like you're skipping out on a shared inside joke—but it's fleeting. Everyone will forget about it by lunch anyway.\n\n You can deal with sitting at your desk alone.\n \n\n \n[Choice: Choose your clothes]\n[Choice: Just wear something]\n[Choice: Outfit Preset #1]\n[Choice: Outfit Preset #2]\n[Choice: Outfit Preset #3]",

Per usual, Luke is already waiting for you at the end of your driveway, bouncing slightly on his heels like he's been standing there for five seconds but has already cycled through six different thoughts and three songs in his head.\n\n When he sees you, he throws both arms in the air like you've just arrived onstage. \"Let's go!\" he shouts, then immediately lowers his voice like it was too loud even for him. \"Dude. You're lucky I didn't text you five times. I've been SO ready for Desk Pet Day.\"\n\n You chuckle, falling into step beside him as the two of you start the familiar walk toward Pacific Crest. Luke eyes your backpack, squinting like he's searching for something.\n\n \"Alright, [name], spill it,\" he says. \"What'd you bring? Don't say anything. I know you brought something. You have desk pet energy today.\"\n\n You unzip the front pocket just enough for the little green head of your Creeper action figure to peek out.\n\n \"NO WAY,\" Luke exclaims, skidding to a stop and clutching his chest. \"Is that—is that a Joyous Meal Creeper?! The old one? Like OG survival mode vibes?\"\n\n You nod, already grinning. \"He's a little worn, but yeah. Somehow still intact.\"\n\n Luke grins back. \"Dude, that's so... iconic. Nostalgic. Literally explosive.\"\n\n Then he unzips his own bag, clearly holding back the excitement of a magician about to reveal their greatest trick. \"Okay, okay, okay. Prepare your soul. Because you are not ready for mine.\"\n\n From his backpack, he pulls out a can of Munchmeat.\n\n You blink. It's not even a plush ham. It's a literal, unopened can. Slightly dented.\n\n He beams. \"Meet Sir Hammington the Third. My emotional support meat.\"\n\n You stop walking. \"You brought a can of fucking ham, Luke.\"\n\n He nods solemnly. \"Desk Pet Day said to bring what comforts you. Sir Hammington's been through a lot with me. Field trips. Finals. That time I got grounded for trying to duct tape myself to a drone and fly.\"\n\n \"You are so weird.\"\n\n Luke nudges your shoulder with a proud smile. \"And you brought a tiny explosive cube with anger issues. We're perfect.\"\n\n The two of you keep walking, laughter trailing behind you as the school comes into view. Whatever today brings, you've already got the best start possible.\n\n \n The morning sun spills across the front yard, catching the dew on the grass as you step out of your house. As usual, Luke is waiting at the curb, practically vibrating with energy, arms folded over a messenger bag. The moment he sees you, he lights up.\n\n \"[name],\" he yells dramatically, like it's been years instead of hours. \"Tell me you brought something for Desk Pet Day. Tell me you didn't bail.\"\n\n You smirk and unzip the front pocket of your bag just enough for the clown duck's curly red hair and ruffled collar to peek out.\n\n Luke leans in, squints, and then reels back in horror. \"NO. No. What—what is that?\"\n\n \"A duck,\" you say flatly.\n\n \"Bro, that is not a duck,\" he replies, staring like it might come alive. \"That is a cursed spirit that climbed out of a sewer drain and decided to haunt a kid's birthday party.\"\n\n \"I mean, you're not wrong.\"\n\n Luke grins wide, then raises a dramatic hand to the sky like he's about to perform in the middle of the sidewalk. \"You are not the clown, [name]. You are—wait.\" He squints. \"You're not the clown... You're... you bring the clowns? No. You own the circus?\"\n\n You blink. \"What?\"\n\n \"No, hold on, I got it.\" He pauses, then proudly declares, \"You are not just the clown, you are the whole party!\"\n\n There's a long pause.\n\n \"That's not it either, is it?\" he says, frowning.\n\n \"Not even close,\" you respond. \"But I appreciate the support.\"\n\n \"Okay, okay. Now it's your turn to be horrified.\" He unzips his messenger bag with a flourish and pulls out a can of Munchmeat.\n\n A real, honest-to-God metal can of processed meat, the label slightly faded and the top dented like it's survived a few earthquakes.\n\n \"Behold Sir Hammington the third,\" he says, holding it up like it's a sacred relic. \"Emotional support. Emergency lunch. Paperweight. He wears many hats.\"\n\n You stare at him. \"You brought... canned ham.\"\n\n \"Yup.\" He pats the can fondly. \"The school said no live animals. The pigs that contributed to this are long gone. A noble sacrifice, if you ask me.\"\n\n You both laugh as the school comes into view at the end of the block, ready for whatever weird judgments your \"pets\" are about to enjoy.\n\n \n You step outside into the soft morning glow, backpack over your shoulder. The gentle weight in the main compartment feels oddly comforting and familiar. Nestled inside is [plushieName]—your little panda plushie.\n\n You bought him back at the mall two weeks ago, and you've quickly come to actually care about him. He's soft, perfectly round, and still has that slightly lopsided ear that makes him look like he's always a little confused.\n\n Luke's already waiting at the curb, hands shoved into his pockets, bouncing lightly. He perks up the second he sees you. The moment he spots [plushieName], his face really lights up.\n\n \"Ayy, [plushieName] is back in action!\" Luke beams, jogging a few steps toward you. \"Man, I just knew you were gonna bring him. I was literally thinking about it last night.\"\n\n You blink at him, eyebrows raised. \"Wait, how do you even remember his name?\"\n\n Luke stops dead in his tracks, placing a hand over his chest like you just personally insulted his honor. \"Excuse me?\"\n\n You stifle a laugh as he glares at you, clearly wounded. \"You think I forgot [plushieName]? The panda you bought at the mall? The one that has been smugly sitting on your bed ever since?\"\n\n He shakes his head, deeply offended in the most Luke way possible. \"I'm hurt. I remember everything important, including the name of your plush panda. And the fact that Samantha got that elephant at the exact same time and named it Trample because she said 'Crush' was too subtle.\"\n\n \"Alright, alright,\" you say, grinning. \"I believe you.\"\n\n \"You better,\" Luke says, still pretending to be outraged, though there's a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. \"[plushieName] is an official member of our friend group. He gets birthday cake now. It's canon, I'm telling you.\"\n\n You chuckle, gently patting the plushie's fuzzy head. \"Well, he's ready for his first public appearance.\"\n\n \"And he's gonna crush it,\" Luke exclaims. \"Just like Trample. Probably. Unless Sam's not in the mood to participate today. You never know with her, I swear.\"\n\n \"Oh, she's definitely bringing it,\" you say. \"She'll complain about it until she gets to class, then spend ten minutes picking the perfect place to pose it on her desk.\"\n\n \"Classic Sam,\" Luke says, nodding sagely.\n\n Then with a mischievous glint in his eye, he unzips his bag like he's revealing a sacred artifact.\n\n \"Speaking of classics, allow me to introduce—Sir Hammington the Third.\"\n\n He dramatically reaches inside and pulls out a can of Munchmeat with both hands, holding it up like it's the Holy Grail. The metal catches the morning light, its dented side glinting just enough to make it look vaguely heroic. The label is partially peeling, but the bold red font still proclaims it as \"Premium Baked Ham.\"\n\n You stop walking. \"You actually brought that?\"\n\n Luke beams. \"Of course I did. He's seen many things over the years. Now he'll accompany me to school.\"\n\n You laugh, shaking your head as the two of you keep walking. [plushieName] peeks out from your main pocket, and from the look on Luke's face, you can tell he's definitely planning a crossover fanfic.\n\n \n The early morning sun filters down through the quiet streets of your neighborhood as you step out the front door. Your backpack feels a little heavier than usual thanks to the... very specific passenger riding inside.\n\n You reach the curb just in time to see Luke pacing a little by the mailbox, ranting to himself about something. When he spots you, his face lights up. \"There you are!\" he calls. \"Did you bring one? Please tell me you brought something wild for Desk Pet Day.\"\n\n Without uttering a word, you unzip your backpack's front pocket and tilt it toward him. A pair of wide, unblinking plastic eyes stare out. Tufts of synthetic fur. A beak. Mechanical ears. A relic of nightmares and dreams.\n\n Luke freezes. \"No. No, [name]. You did not.\"\n\n You smirk. \"I did.\"\n\n \"You brought a Furby,\" he says, voice full of awe and horror. \"Like... an actual, functioning Furby?\"\n\n \"Well, functioning is generous,\" you say. \"It made a noise in my backpack while I was changing. I don't even know if it was turned on.\"\n\n Luke inches closer, peering into the bag like he's not sure whether to bow or run. \"This is next-level cursed. This isn't just a desk pet. This is a warning.\"\n\n You zip it closed halfway, leaving just its creepy little eyes peeking out.\n\n \"I'm going to make it stare at my math teacher all period,\" you add casually.\n\n Luke bursts into laughter, nearly tripping over the sidewalk. \"You're a menace. That thing's going to get you sent to counseling or summon you into another dimension.\"\n\n You grin. \"Then at least I'll have company.\"\n\n Luke pretends to wipe a tear from his eye. \"I was gonna say I brought something weird, but man, there is no topping haunted Furby energy. The bar is in the basement now. In the dirt. In Furby hell.\"\n\n You nudge him with your elbow. \"C'mon, now I have to know. What did you bring?\"\n\n Luke grins like he's been waiting for the question. \"Alright, prepare yourself.\"\n\n With the kind of theatrical flair that suggests he rehearsed this, he swings his messenger bag around, unzips it slowly, and then—with both hands—pulls out a can of Munchmeat.\n\n It's dented. The label curls at the edges. Faded red text proudly declares it as \"Premium Baked Ham.\" The image on the label looks less like meat and like a pink blob.\n\n You blink. \"No way.\"\n\n \"Sir Hammington the Third. Long may he reign.\"\n\n \"You're bringing a canned ham as your desk pet?\"\n\n He nods solemnly. \"He's got presence. Gravitas. A quiet dignity. Also, I forgot to get anything last night, and this was the only thing here.\"\n\n \"My Furby's better. It's got personality.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" Luke says, eyeing your bag with mild fear, \"and possibly a soul. Mine's just processed pork. Safe and predictable.\"\n\n \"And if it somehow explodes?\"\n\n \"Then so be it.\"\n\n You laugh as the school begins to come into view. Somehow, your Furby and Luke's Munchmeat still feel like the most unhinged pairing possible. And that feels exactly right.\n\n \n The morning sun is already high enough to warm the sidewalk as you step outside, backpack slung over your shoulders. You feel light. Maybe too light. The front pocket of your bag, where a chaotic little desk pet could have lived, is conspicuously empty.\n\n And waiting at the end of your driveway, as always, is Luke.\n\n He spots you immediately and grins wide, waving like you've just returned from war. \"There he is! Okay—tell me what you brought. I can tell it's gonna be good. You had that look in your eye yesterday. Like... unhinged potential.\"\n\n You cringe slightly. \"Uh... I didn't bring anything.\"\n\n Luke stops walking. Full. Stop.\n\n \"You what.\"\n\n You shrug, already bracing yourself. \"Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I couldn't decide. Everything felt kinda dumb, so I just... didn't.\"\n\n \"[name],\" he says, staring at you like you just told him you forgot your own name. \"It's Desk Pet Day. The one time we get to bring cursed objects to school without judgment.\"\n\n He slowly unzips his messenger bag, still maintaining intense eye contact, and pulls out a can of Munchmeat. He cradles it gently in both hands like it's his baby.\n\n \"Look at this,\" he says. \"Look into his dented metallic soul. This is Sir Hammington the Third. My emotional support meat. And you brought nothing? You had infinite options, and you decided to go with the void?\"\n \n \"I just wasn't feeling it.\"\n\n Luke gasps like he's physically in pain. \"You're killing him, [name]. Look—he's trembling.\"\n\n You glance at the can of Munchmeat. It is very much not trembling.\n\n \"Yeah, he looks terrified,\" you deadpan.\n\n Luke gently returns the can to his bag like he's tucking in a child. \"Well, now I gotta carry the weird energy for the both of us.\"\n\n \"Per usual.\"\n\n \"True,\" he says, grinning again as the two of you fall into step toward school. \"But I'm just saying, if your desk looks boring today, I'll loan you Hammington. Shared custody. You can have him on weekends.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but don't argue.\n\n Maybe you didn't bring anything, but with Luke around, it's not like your day's gonna be lacking in weird.\n \n\n[Choice: Go to school]",

You make your way to the corner, where your table—claimed since sophomore year—is half-covered in crumbs, cracked in one spot, and eternally yours.\n\nLuke's already there, halfway through a tray of fries. Across from him, Samantha sits with one foot on the bench, a salad container in her lap, and eyes sharp.\n\nYou slide into the seat beside her, and both of them pause, like they've been waiting for you.\n\n\"There he is,\" Samantha drawls. \"Mr. Capsule Wardrobe himself.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"What?\"\n\nLuke points at you with a fry. \"She's been on this for, like, five minutes. Something about your entire closet being made of the same three items.\"\n\nSamantha doesn't even look up from her salad. \"I'm just saying that I wouldn't need more than two crayons to color in a sketch of your outfit.\"\n\nYou realize that they're referring to your usual outfit. A plain white T-shirt and cargo shorts. It's comfortable, dependable, and possibly worn far too often.\n\n\"It's not that bad,\" you say.\n\n\"You've been dressed like an NPC since middle school,\" Samantha says flatly. \"It's not an insult, mind you. NPCs are great, real reliable. I just think it wouldn't hurt to... expand your closet.\"\n\n\"Yeah!\" Luke jumps in, full of renewed purpose. \"Like, surprise everyone with a cool outfit! Walk into school and suddenly people are surprised.\"\n\n\"Come on, I have other clothes,\" you insist.\n\n\"Do you, though?\" Samantha asks, leaning in. \"The other stuff you have isn't that exciting either. I think half of your outfits use the white shirt as a base.\"\n\nLuke squints dramatically. \"I mean, now that I think about it, I haven't seen much.\"\n\n\"Okay, fine,\" you say, throwing your hands up. \"So what if I have a uniform?\"\n\n\"It's not a uniform,\" Samantha says. \"It's a cry for retail help.\"\n\nYou open your mouth to argue, but she's already side-eyeing you.\n\n\"I mean, if you're not doing anything after school...\" she adds, more casually this time, twirling her fork like she's debating whether to stab the lettuce or you. \"I could take you to the mall. Help you pick out something that doesn't scream '[name].'\"\n\n\"Wow,\" you say, raising an eyebrow. \"Generous and insulting. How do I repay you?\"\n\n\"By letting me incinerate those shorts in a trash can,\" she replies without missing a beat.\n\nLuke, halfway through a mouthful of burger, lifts his head. \"Wait, you guys are going shopping? That sounds—\" He pauses before slowly shaking his head. \"Nope. I was gonna say fun, but I remembered I have practice.\"\n\n\"Football?\" you ask.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he nods. \"Homecoming game's this weekend, remember? Coach has me running routes until my legs fall off. Apparently, I'm supposed to be 'explosive off the line' or whatever that means.\"\n\nSamantha mutters, \"He probably means stop eating entire sleeves of MornPops before bed.\"\n\n\"How could you say that?\" Luke utters, a hand on his heart. \"Also, MornPops are explosive. Emotionally.\"\n\nYou snort, and Samantha doesn't even bother hiding her grin.\n\nLuke leans across the table toward you. \"But real talk? Even if I wasn't busy, I'd be useless. I have, like, two fashion settings: 'jersey' and 'shirt.'\"\n\n\"Didn't you once buy a shirt that just said 'no.' in Comic Sans?\" you ask.\n\n\"Yeah, and people loved it,\" he says proudly. \"It was a mood.\"\n\nSamantha gives you a sideways glance. \"So, what do you think, [name]? You up for a little retail therapy?\"\n\nYou shrug, trying to play it cool. \"I mean... maybe.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" she echoes with a sly smile. \"I'll take it.\"\n\nLuke gestures with dramatic flair. \"Go forth, my fashion children. I'll be scoring touchdowns while you discover the magic of jorts.\"\n\nYou shake your head and lean back in your chair, watching the two of them banter. Shopping sounds mildly terrifying, but with Samantha leading the charge, it doesn't seem quite as bad.\n\nMaybe even... kind of fun.\n\nIn a mildly chaotic, soul-crushing way.\n\n[Choice: Onwards!]",

The quiet hum of the house greets you—TV faint in the living room, the dishwasher running, that familiar soft stillness that means no one's rushing.\n\nYou head straight upstairs, not even glancing at your phone. By the time you collapse face-first onto your bed, your backpack's already halfway on the floor and your arms are spread wide like you just finished a marathon.\n\nThe fabric shifts uncomfortably against your skin, and overall it just feels snugger than you remember. Everything's been feeling a little... different lately. A little off. Or maybe too on, like the mirror knows more about you than you do.\n\nYou shift, rolling onto your back, and let your eyes drift up to the ceiling. The light from the window cuts across your room in stripes, and for a second, it's just you and the slow tick of the clock on your wall.\n\nAnd then a knock.\n\nYour door opens a crack, and your mom pokes her head in. \"Hey, sweetie,\" she says in that voice she uses when she's trying to be casual.\n\nYou tilt your head, not quite sitting up. \"Hey.\"\n\nShe steps in, holding a laundry basket against her hip. She doesn't really look at it, though. Instead, her eyes flick to you—lingering for a second longer than usual, like she's noticing the way your frame sits in those clothes now. She doesn't comment. Not directly.\n\n\"You, uh... you doing okay?\" she asks. \"School alright?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" you say, then add, \"It was Desk Pet Day.\"\n\nShe pauses. \"Is that the one with the stuffed animals?\"\n\n\"And assorted emotional support objects, yes.\"\n\nShe smiles faintly and walks further in, setting the laundry basket at the foot of your bed. \"You know, you do have to go shopping at some point,\" she says as she starts idly sorting socks.\n\nYou blink. \"For...?\"\n\nShe gives you a look. \"Clothes that actually fit,\" she says gently. \"Or clothes that feel more like you.

Trying stuff on. Seeing what fits now. learning what you like now.\"\n\nYou nod, barely. But it's enough.\n\nShe pats the end of your bed, then grabs the laundry basket and heads for the door.\n\n\"Oh, and if you want help paying for it,\" she adds, glancing back with a wink, \"I still owe you for pretending to like my dumplings last week.\"\n\nThe door clicks shut behind her, and you're left with her words. They linger, weaving into the quiet.\n\nClothes that feel more like you, huh?\n\nYou lie there, staring at the ceiling, and let the idea settle in.\n\nWho should you go shopping with?\n\n[Choice: Ask your mom]\n[Choice: Ask your mom and Lily]\n[Choice: Ask Samantha]\n[Choice: Ask Samantha and secretly invite Jessica]",

There's no hesitation now—not in your hands, not in your chest. Just a steady rhythm as you lay each item out carefully, fingertips brushing fabric like you're afraid it might just dissolve if you handle it too roughly.\n\n But it doesn't.\n\n It's all real. Soft, textured, chosen. Yours.\n\n As you start changing, there's a sense of rhythm to it—nothing rushed, nothing hidden. Each motion feels familiar, like muscle memory you didn't know you had. The way the fabric settles against your body, the way it hugs in places that used to feel off and now feel oddly right. You glance toward the mirror once, just to check the fit, but your eyes linger a little longer than they should. You adjust a fold, fix a line, and tug gently at the hem.\n\n Then you really look.\n\n And your breath catches.\n\n There's a version of you in the mirror that you've seen in dreams, in daydreams, in glances that lasted just a little too long. But this isn't a dream. It's real. You're standing here, wearing something that doesn't feel like a costume or a disguise—it feels comfortable. You're not trying to be anyone else. You just look like you.\n\n You tilt your head slightly and shift your stance, letting your arms rest at your sides with a kind of delicate confidence. There's a warmth rising in your chest, subtle at first, but growing with every heartbeat. You take a small step forward, then another, spinning just a little to watch the fabric move with you. Your laugh, when it slips out, surprises you with how natural it sounds. You really hadn't noticed how much tension you'd been holding until it finally let go.\n\n You feel beautiful. Not because anyone told you so. Not because the lighting is good. Just because, for once, you don't feel like you're chasing your reflection—you're finally standing in it.\n\n As you smooth your top one last time and meet your own eyes in the glass, something shifts in the air. A tingle begins to crawl along your spine, soft and electric. It builds slowly, familiar now in a way that isn't frightening anymore. You place a hand lightly against your chest—not to brace yourself, but to stay grounded in this feeling.\n\n It's happening again.\n\n Another change is coming, and this time, you don't flinch. You don't question it. You just breathe in, let the warmth settle around you like a second skin, and welcome it.\n \n \n You sit on the bed for a moment longer, then quietly get up and walk over to the bags. No drama or deep internal debate, just... a quiet decision.\n\n The clothes are still folded neatly from earlier, tags brushing against your fingertips as you lift them out one by one. It's strange how familiar they already feel—how easily they slip into place, like your body isn't fighting the shape of them the way it used to.\n\n You change without rushing. There's no hesitation, but no thrill either. Just a steady sense of calm. You glance at yourself in the mirror as you finish. No wince. No smile. Just a nod.\n\n It works.\n\n You shift your posture a little, trying different stances. Arms loose at your sides and shoulders relaxed. You don't go full model or try any goofy poses—you're not that comfortable—but you let yourself move in it. It's not a joke, and it's not something sacred either. It's just... fine.\n\n You tilt your head at your reflection. You still look like you. Maybe a version of you you hadn't expected to meet, but still you.\n\n And you're okay with that.\n\n You're not giddy. You're not caught in some moment of self-discovery. But you're not resisting it, either. This isn't a costume. This isn't a crisis.\n\n It's clothes. They feel good on your skin. That's enough.\n\n You glance down, adjusting a sleeve, and that's when you feel it.\n\n The chill.\n\n It spreads slowly—up your spine, across your shoulders, down through your fingertips. Your breath catches without meaning to, body tensing just slightly out of instinct.\n\n You know this feeling. You've felt it many times before.\n\n You look back up at the mirror and exhale, steadying yourself. You're ready.\n \n \n \n You sit on the edge of your bed for a while, elbow on your knees, staring at the bags by your desk like they're staring back.\n\n Eventually, you sigh.\n\n You're not sure why you stand up. Maybe it's just to get it over with. Maybe it's curiosity, or just a small itch in your chest that says to look. Not for fun. Not to enjoy it. Just to understand—to put it on, stand there, and see if it's still weird. Still off. Still not you.\n\n You peel back the plastic and dig through what you picked out. You just think about the fabric, the color, and the shape.\n\n You change with mechanical precision, not letting your mind linger too long on any one motion. Just getting dressed. That's all.\n\n The mirror doesn't lie.\n\n You stand in front of it, arms slightly stiff at your sides. You shift your stance a little. Straighten your back. Set your jaw. Try to find something neutral in the way you hold yourself—nothing soft or dramatic. Just solid. The kind of pose that doesn't invite any questions.\n\n You try crossing your arms. Then uncrossing them. You don't feel ridiculous exactly. But you definitely don't feel comfortable either. Your reflection is clear, sure, but your reaction isn't. It's not disgust. Not panic. It's more like... staring at someone you don't know well enough to trust.\n\n You take a slow breath, flex your shoulders, and shift your weight again. Just trying to find a pose that'll make it all click.\n\n It never does.\n\n And then—right as you're about to turn away—you feel it.\n\n That tingle.\n\n Low in your spine. Creeping outward. Warm. Electric. The air feels thinner. Your skin prickles like the world just exhaled around you.\n\n You know this feeling.\n\n It's happening again.\n \n\n [Choice: Transform]\n\n \n You glance at the bags again, sitting there next to your desk... but the moment passes.\n\n Not now.\n\n You exhale through your nose, soft and slow, and let your shoulders drop. There's no rush to figure it all out. No reason to try and squeeze more out of a day that's already asked so much of you.\n\n You shift back onto your bed, legs stretched and arms folded behind your head. The mattress creaks in a familiar way beneath you. Your body aches in that way that tells you that you've done enough for the day.\n\n The bags stay by the desk. Waiting. Quiet. You'll get to them when you're ready.\n\n You don't check your phone. Don't turn on music. You just let yourself be.

The music from Lily's room fades behind you. You hesitate, then drift out into the hallway. The laundry room is open, and your mom's there, folding towels with a practiced rhythm. Her back is mostly to you and she hums something soft and aimless, surrounded by warm light and the scent of clean linen. As you lean against the doorframe, she glances over her shoulder, catching sight of you.\n\n \"Hey, sweetie. How'd it go?\"\n\n You shrug, trying to sound casual. \"She said no. Didn't even think about it, just—'not with you.'\"\n\n Mom pauses, folding the towel in her hands a little slower. \"Oh,\" she says gently. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n You keep your eyes on the floor. \"It's fine. Whatever. We haven't really been talking much lately anyway.\"\n\n She gives you a look—one of those looks that sees more than you want her to. You sigh, letting out a tired breath. \"I just thought... I dunno. I leave for college soon. Figured it might be nice.\"\n\n Your mom steps over, still holding a towel, and places a hand on your shoulder. \"You two have time, [name]. I know it doesn't always feel like it, but you do. Siblings drift, but they find their way back to each other. It's not always quick, and it's most definitely not always easy. But it does happen.\"\n\n You nod, not quite trusting yourself to say anything back.\n\n She pats your shoulder and flashes a smile. \"For now, you've got me. And a mall full of overpriced clothes. Let's go, alright?\"\n\n You manage a small smile. \"Yeah. Let's go.\"\n\n \"Let me grab my purse,\" she says, disappearing down the hall.\n\n A few minutes later, she meets you at the front door, keys in hand.\n\n \"You ready?\" she asks, smiling.\n\n You nod.\n\n And together, you step outside and head toward the car, the mall waiting quietly ahead.\n\n \n You lie there for a few more minutes, staring at the ceiling like it's going to give you answers. Your mom's words still echo gently in your head. For once, instead of pushing the thought away, you sit up.\n\n Your voice comes out quieter than you expected as you call down the hallway. \"Mom?\"\n\n There's a pause, then her voice drifts back. \"Yeah?\"\n\n You hesitate, then stand, crossing the room and stepping out into the hallway. She's in the laundry room, folding towels like she always does. Her back is to you, but she turns slightly as you lean against the doorframe.\n\n \"Um... would you maybe wanna go to the mall?\" you ask, not quite meeting her eyes. \"Just to help me find some stuff?\"\n\n Her hands freeze on a towel, and for a second, she doesn't say anything. You glance up and catch the flicker of surprise on her face—quickly followed by something else. Warmth, maybe even hope. She's excited in a way she's trying very hard to smother beneath a carefully casual expression.\n\n \"Yeah,\" she says, a little too quickly. \"Yeah, of course. We can do that if you want.\"\n\n You nod. \"Cool.\"\n\n She smoothes the towel in her hands like it's suddenly become the most interesting object on earth. \"I mean, it's been a while since we did anything like that. It might be nice. Could use a break from folding things that aren't mine.\"\n\n She's trying to keep her voice steady and her smile easy, but there's a brightness in her eyes that gives her away. You haven't spent much time with her lately—caught up in the school, the [referto], and everything else. Without even meaning to, you've been keeping her at a distance, and it's clear she's noticed.\n\n \"Let me grab my purse,\" she says, disappearing down the hall with a little more bounce in her step than she probably meant to show.\n\n A few minutes later, she meets you at the front door, keys in hand.\n\n \"You ready?\" she asks, smiling.\n\n You nod.\n\n And together, you step outside and head toward the car, the mall waiting quietly ahead.\n \n\n[Choice: Drive to the mall]",

The soft thump of pop beats pulse through the door. It's one of those boy band tracks she claims to be \"so over,\" but still listens to on repeat. You knock gently, careful not to startle her.\n\n There's a pause—then a loud, \"What?\" from the other side, just sharp enough to be dramatic.\n\n You crack the door open. \"Hey, Lily. I was thinking of going to the mall with Mom,\" you say, trying to sound casual. \"Wanna come?\"\n\n Inside, Lily's sprawled across her bed, phone in hand, legs tangled in a blanket. She looks up, blinking at you, suspicious like you just asked her to help you do taxes.\n\n \"What, with you?\" she asks, like it's some impossible idea.\n\n \"No, with your evil twin,\" you say, snorting. \"Yeah, with me.\"\n\n She rolls her eyes and drops back dramatically onto her pillow, the way she always does when she wants to look annoyed, but isn't actually mad. \"Ugh that sounds like so much work.\" Then, quieter, almost like she doesn't want you to hear it: \"But... I guess I could go.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"You guess?\"\n\n Lily tosses her phone aside, grabbing a pillow and hurling it half-heartedly at you. \"Don't make it weird, [name].\"\n\n You laugh, dodging the pillow. \"Wouldn't dream of it.\"\n\n She sits up straighter, trying to look unimpressed, but you catch the flicker of something—interest, maybe even excitement—before she masks it. \"Okay, but don't, like, stand there and watch me get ready. Obviously.\"\n\n \"Right, obviously,\" you say, backing up a step.\n\n \"Out,\" she insists, already climbing off the bed and waving a hand at the door. You obey, but not before you catch her pulling open the closet and eyeing a cute oversized zip-up and a plaid skirt combo. She'd never actually admit it, but you just know she spent hours picking it out in order to appear effortless.\n\n The door clicks shut behind you, and a few minutes later, it swings back open. Lily steps into the hallway in a black zip hoodie over a fitted top and the skirt you spotted, paired with her favorite pair of sneakers. Her eyeliner's still sharp from earlier in the day, and even though she's clearly redone her lip gloss, she plays it off like she didn't. Her wolfcut is brushed out just enough to look like she didn't try as well.\n\n \"You gonna keep staring, or are we telling Mom?\" she asks.\n\n \"I didn't know I needed permission to admire fashion excellence,\" you state, smirking.\n\n She rolls her eyes. \"Shut up.\"\n\n But when she bumps your shoulder as you turn down the hall together, it's playful and familiar.\n\n Together, you head down the hall to find Mom.\n\n The laundry room is warm and smells like fresh fabric softener. Sunlight filters through the small window above the counter, casting soft shadows across neat stacks of folded towels. Your mom is at her usual post, humming aimlessly while she folds. When she hears your footsteps, she glances over her shoulder with a smile already tugging at her lips.\n\n \"Hey, sweetie. What's up?\"\n\n You lean against the doorframe, trying to sound casual. \"So, uh... I was thinking. About the mall. If you're still up for it, I wanna go.\"\n\n Your mom raises an eyebrow, a little surprised—but clearly pleased. \"Oh? Yeah, of course. That sounds nice.\"\n\n \"Also,\" you add as Lily comes into view. \"Lily's coming too.\"\n\n \"I'm being dragged against my will,\" Lily says dryly, though the small smirk on her face betrays her.\n\n \"Mmm, sure you are,\" your mom says, chuckling. \"Alright then, let me grab my bag.\"\n\n A few minutes later, the three of you meet up by the front door, shoes squeaking lightly on the tile. You hold the door open as Lily steps out, squinting at the light like it's too early for sunshine, even though it's not. The breeze is crisp, and the scent of autumn leaves hangs in the air.\n\n You follow her outside, Mom locking the door behind you. Your footsteps echo softly on the pavement as you all head down the path toward the car.\n\n For a moment, things feel easy, like they used to be.\n\n [Choice: Drive to the mall]\n\n \n \n You pause in the middle of the hallway, clutching the hem of your top as you listen to the faint hum of Lily's music bleeding through her closed bedroom door. It's some overly dramatic boy band she's obsessed with lately—soaring harmonies, sugary lyrics about heartbreak, and just enough autotune to make you question humanity.\n\n You sigh.\n\n Mom offered to take you shopping today, and part of you thought—maybe—if Lily came too, things wouldn't be so awkward. Maybe you could even patch things up a little, be normal siblings like you used to be. But even as you raise your hand to knock, doubt creeps in.\n\n You haven't been close to her in a long time. It didn't happen all at once, just little moments that slipped by: skipped dinners, quiet car rides, jokes that didn't land, and conversations that never started. You used to be closer, back when things were simpler, but somewhere between middle school and now, the space between you stretched wider and wider until neither of you knew how to cross it. Since the [referto], you've barely made an effort—too wrapped up in your own chaos to check in on her. You've just been... gone.\n\n Still, you knock.\n\n Three times. Firm, but not loud.\n\n The music lowers just a bit. Then you hear her voice, sharp through the door. \"What?\"\n\n You swallow. \"Hey. Um... I was thinking about going to the mall with Mom. Thought maybe you'd wanna come too?\"\n\n There's a pause that stretches just long enough to make you regret asking.\n\n Then her voice comes through, flat and disinterested. \"No thanks.\"\n\n \"Seriously?\" you ask, frowning. \"I thought you liked the mall.\"\n\n \"Not with you,\" she snaps back immediately. The music goes back up.\n\n You stand there for a second, staring at the door. You could try again, knock louder, push the issue—but you know better. Lily's made up her mind, and you've given her more than enough reasons not to say yes. Her rejection stings more than you want to admit, but what did you expect?\n\n After a beat, you turn and walk away, the thud of your footsteps heavier than before. You hear the music crank up even louder behind you, and for a second, you wonder if she did that for your benefit—just to make sure you knew she was done talking.\n\n Guess it's just you and Mom today.\n\n [Choice: Ask your mom]",

The golden California sun filters through the windshield, warm but not hot, casting gentle shadows across the dashboard. Outside, the trees wear their autumn colors proudly—leaves blazing orange and gold, swirling across the pavement with every breeze.\n\nYou and Lily are in the back seats, your knees bumping occasionally every time the car passes a speed bump. She's already halfway into a rant about her science teacher before you've even made it past the corner.\n\n\"I swear he just makes up half the stuff he says,\" she groans, pulling at the sleeves of her hoodie. \"Like, he told us that static electricity could technically make your hair explode. What does that even mean?\"\n\n\"Hmm, that honestly sounds like a valuable life lesson,\" you say, snorting. \"I think you should test it. For science, of course.\"\n\nLily glares at you. \"Yeah, [name]. Let me just go rub a balloon on my head and stand next to a power line.\"\n\n\"I'll bring the balloon,\" you offer, a wide grin on your face.\n\nFrom the front seat, your mom glances at the rearview mirror with a fond smile. \"Please don't explode your sister's hair. At least not today.\"\n\n\"You're no fun,\" you mutter.\n\n\"Correct,\" she replies. \"That's how I survive parenting.\"\n\nLily smirks and leans against the window. You're glad she came. The banter feels easy for once—like things are still a little tangled between you, but not impossible. Not today.\n\nThe car passes by rows of houses and dry lawns scattered with leaves, the breeze flickering through slightly cracked windows. You watch the sunlight dance through the interior as the road hums beneath you.\n\nYou glance at Lily, then at your mom, and think about where to steer the conversation next.\n\n[Choice: Bring up that one time Lily got lost]\n[Choice: Ask if they also feel like time's moving way too fast]\n[Choice: Who would survive the longest in a zombie apocalypse?]",

Just a clean, gentle garment that feels safe.\n\n You turn it over in your hands, feeling its lightness, the subtle elasticity in the band. It doesn't ask much of you. It doesn't demand you know who you are or how you want to be seen. It just exists. It's just neutral.\n\n You slip it on slowly and carefully. It hugs your chest like a whisper—present, but barely. Looking at yourself in the window, you almost don't look different. But you feel different.\n\n Your mom doesn't say anything, but she does give you a smile.\n\n You did enough for today.\n \n \n \n You hesitate the longest in front of the black one. It's the kind of bra that feels serious, like it belongs to someone confident. You take it off the hook, heart pounding a little, and slowly ease it on.\n\n It fits like a second skin—firm but not tight, clean lines, no lace or color to distract. In the mirror, you look sharper. Like someone who made a decision instead of getting swept into one.\n\n You breathe out, and it feels like the first full breath you've taken in a while.\n\n Your mom tilts her head, looking at you. \"You look... grounded.\"\n\n You nod.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"I guess that's kind of the point.\"\n \n \n \n You reach for the lavender bra, hesitating for a second before lifting it from the hook. It feels light in your hands, the pale purple fabric catching the light.\n\n It's a small thing, but it does feels like a choice.\n\n You try it on, adjusting the straps slowly. It fits snugly, securely. You glance at yourself in the mirror, and it's still you, just with color.\n\n Your mom sees your expression and doesn't say anything for a moment. Then, quietly, \"It suits you.\"\n\n You nod, and though your voice barely comes out, it's steady.\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n \"Yeah, I think so too.\"\n \n \n \"I guess, yeah.\"\n \n \n \n \n Your fingers hover over the lacy one for a full ten seconds before you finally take it down. It's delicate. Intricate. The floral patterns are stitched in black thread, the material a little sheer. It's pretty. You're not quite sure why you chose it, only that part of you needs to.\n\n You slip it on slowly, and it feels softer than it should. In that bra, it doesn't look like you're hiding, it looks like you're being.\n\n Your mom doesn't say anything at first. She watches you for a long moment before her expression softens.\n\n \"Beautiful,\" she comments, nodding.\n\n You don't respond right away. You just stare at the mirror, eyes wide, chest rising and falling steadily.\n\n \"...Yeah,\" you whisper.\n \n\n \n \n \n You reach for the white bra.\n\n It's the most neutral of the bunch—plain, seamless, and soft. The kind of thing you could wear and forget it's even there. No color to read into or message to send, it's just... safe. And safe feels okay right now.\n\n You unclip it and slip it on, the band fitting snugly around your ribs. It's gentle. Light. Not restrictive, just present. You glance at your reflection in the mirror and realize your body feels a little more comfortable, like it finally has permission to settle.\n\n There's no dramatic revelation or swelling music, just a soft kind of rightness.\n\n You breathe out and roll your shoulders. This, you can handle.\n \n \n \n Your fingers hover, then curl around the sleek black one. There's something about it—minimal, structured, and just a little bold. You're not sure what exactly draws you to it, but you want it.\n\n You try it on.\n\n The fabric hugs your chest firmly, but not uncomfortably. The straps feel solid. Supportive. You look at yourself in the mirror and for a second, you seem more grounded.\n\n There's a small shift in your spine, a straighter posture, and a breath that comes easier.\n\n You didn't expect this, but here you are.\n \n \n \n You hesitate over the lavender one.\n\n It's soft. Delicate, but not girly. Calm. You hold it up and it feels like something chosen—not just worn. Almost like it's for you.\n\n You slip it on.\n\n It fits perfectly—gentle and stretchy, not too tight, not too loose. The color is subtle, but undeniably there. You look in the mirror, expecting to feel awkward. But instead, you feel something close to warmth.\n\n It's not about standing out, it's about softening into yourself.\n \n \n \n Your eyes land on the lacy one.\n\n It's delicate. Floral-patterned. Slightly sheer. Something about it feels like stepping off a ledge and trusting the ground will rise up to catch you. You're not even sure why the hell you reach for it.\n\n Maybe it's because it scares you a little. Or maybe because it doesn't.\n\n You slip it on slowly. The lace settles across your chest. You face the mirror, expecting to feel ridiculous. But you don't.\n\n You actually, somehow, feel pretty.\n\n For a moment, you stop bracing against yourself. You just exist.\n \n\n \n \n \n You take the white bra off the hook, your fingers brushing over the fabric. It's soft—like really soft. Smooth and simple, nothing loud about it. No lace, no patterns, no bright colors or extra straps. Just something clean and neutral, like it was made to not make a big deal out of anything. Something that feels... safe.\n\n You turn it over in your hands, testing the give of the band, running your thumb along the edge. It's light, barely anything. There's no pressure in it to be anything more than what it is. No frills, no signals. It doesn't ask you to figure anything out, and you're grateful for that. It just exists.\n\n Behind you, your mom watches quietly, still giving you space but clearly tuned in. lily is perched on the edge of the bench, leaning forward with her elbows on her knees, unusually quiet for her. She's not fidgeting. She's not cracking jokes. She's just waiting.\n\n You slip it on slowly, carefully—your first real bra. The band settles around your chest, snug but not tight. The fabric presses against your skin with a kind of softness you didn't expect. It doesn't flatten. It doesn't lift. It just fits.\n\n You glance at the mirror—not to admire or scrutinize, but just to check. And you almost don't look different at all. The shape is subtle, from a distance, and you might not even notice a change.\n\n But you feel it. And that's the difference.\n\n Your mom catches your eyes in the reflection. \"How's it feel?\" she asks softly.\n\n You don't answer right away. You shift a little in place, testing how the straps move with your shoulders, how the band holds when you breathe.\n\n \"Kind of like it's not even there,\" you say.\n\n She smiles. \"That's how you know it's the right one.\"\n\n Lily tilts her head slightly. \"You look... like yourself,\" she says, a little awkward, like she's still working out the words as they come. \"Not, like, 'different [name]' or anything. Just... comfy [name]. You know?\"\n\n You glance at her, surprised. She shrugs, like she didn't say something weirdly kind.\n\n You look back in the mirror. You don't have answers. You don't need them right now.\n\n You did enough for today.\n \n \n \n You pause the longest in front of the black one. It hangs from the hook like it knows exactly what it is—clean lines, simple shape, no lace, no decoration. Just fabric and structure. It feels like the kind of bra that belongs to someone who knows who they are. Or maybe someone trying to get there.\n\n Your heart beats a little faster as you reach for it. The material is smooth but firm in your hands, the band holding a quiet confidence you don't quiet feel yet. Still, you step into it, ease the straps over your shoulders, and adjust it slowly.\n\n It fits like a second skin. Secure. Not restrictive, just present. It doesn't push or shape much, but it holds. In the mirror, the reflection looking back at you isn't dramatic, but it's... different. Cleaner and sharper. You look like someone who chose something, not just someone caught in something.\n\n You breathe out, and the breath feels full for the first time in a while. Like your lungs finally had room again.\n\n Behind you, your mom watches with quiet focus, and then tilts her head slightly. \"You really do look grounded,\" she says, her voice soft but certain. \"Like you're standing on your own.\"\n\n You blink once, then nod. \"Yeah,\" you say. \"I guess that's kind of the point.\"\n\n Lily is still sitting on the bench, her arms draped over her knees. She leans forward a bit, studying you in the mirror like she's trying to see what's changed. \"It's kinda cool, honestly,\" she says after a beat. \"Not saying that you look cool—you don't—but you seem solid. Like you're not flinching.\"\n\n You glance at her, surprised by the honesty.\n\n She shrugs, eyes still on the reflection. \"I'm just glad that you still look like... you.\"\n\n You meet your eyes in the mirror again. There's no sudden clarity, no grand transformation. But something in your shoulders shifts. Something in your posture settles.\n\n You look like someone who made a decision.\n\n And for now, that's enough.\n \n \n \n You reach for the lavender bra—the softest shade of purple—hesitating as your fingers close around the fabric. It feels light, almost delicate, yet surprisingly real. You remember how lavender's always been your favorite color. In this moment, it feels like something more than just a color—something personal.\n\n You slide it over your head and adjust the straps slowly. The band settles comfortably around your ribcage, secure but not tight. You take a break and face the mirror.\n\n You're still you—no drastic change in shape, no dramatic shift—but there's color now. A little bit of your personality woven into something basic, something intimate. It's a small thing, but it truly feels like yours.\n\n Your mom watches you for a long second before speaking. Her smile is quiet but sincere. \"It suits you,\" she says gently.\n\n You nod, voice soft but steady. \"Yeah,\" you murmur. \"I think so too.\"\n\n From the bench, Lily leans forward, her elbows resting on her knees. She's not full of her usual fire, instead watching like you're somebody she genuinely wants to support, not tease. \"Lavender, huh?\" she says, a spark in her eyes. \"Bold choice. I mean... it's your favorite. I remember your middle school backpack. Makes sense.\"\n\n Your mom steps closer, smoothing a wrinkle on your bra. \"It looks comfortable. You look comfortable. If this feels good, then let's take it.\"\n\n Lily flexes her arms. \"I vote yes. Lavender for the win.\"\n\n Although it's just a color, it feels like so much more to you.\n \n \n \n Your fingers hover over the lacy one for a long moment—long enough for Lily to notice. She tilts her head, brows raised slightly but not saying anything. The bra is delicate, black floral stitching over sheer fabric, the kind of thing that looks like it belongs in a magazine.\n\n It really is pretty. And not in a soft, quiet way like the lavender one. This is a different kind of pretty. Sharper. Braver.\n\n You take it down slowly, the lace catching slightly on your fingertips. You're not sure why you picked it up. You just know something in your chest tugged when you saw it, like a quiet little voice saying, this one.\n\n You slip it on, careful with the straps. It's surprisingly soft against your skin, nothing scratchy or stiff like you expected. It hugs you differently—still gentle, but more revealing. In this bra, you don't look like someone trying to disappear. You look like someone who's not only existing, but choosing.\n\n You glance at the mirror, heart knocking unevenly in your chest.\n\n Your mom doesn't speak right away, just watches. Then, slowly, her expression softens and she nods, her voice quiet. \"Beautiful.\"\n\n You blink. It doesn't sound like flattery. It just sounds true.\n\n Lily, still seated on the bench, squints a little like she's processing the moment. \"Okay, I did not think you'd go for the lace,\" she says honestly, but without judgment. \"Kinda thought you'd grab a plain black one.\"\n\n You glance her way.\n\n \"But—\" she shrugs a little. \"It actually fits. Like, not just size-wise. You look... confident. I don't know. It just works.\"\n\n You meet your own eyes in the mirror, the breath in your chest slow and steady. You almost don't recognize the person looking back, but at the same time, you do.\n\n \"...Yeah,\" you whisper, your voice barely there.\n\n And this time, you mean it.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Bra shopping begone!]",

She doesn't gush or fawn, just offers a warm smile—quietly proud, but careful not to overwhelm you.\n\n \"That's the one?\" she asks, voice low enough that it could be mistaken for a whisper.\n\n You nod. \"Yeah,\" you say. It comes out steadier than you expected.\n\n Lily is still nearby. She stands now, arms crossed loosely over her chest. She eyes you for a second, then nods with a grin that's small, but definitely there. \"You don't look freaked out,\" she says. \"That's... probably a good sign.\"\n\n You huff out a quiet laugh. \"I was definitely freaked out.\"\n\n \"Sure,\" she says. \"But you didn't look it. You look... like you.\" She doesn't say anything else, but her words land heavy in the good kind of way.\n\n Your mom steps up, gently takes the tag from your hand, and heads toward the counter. Riley is already behind it, hands folded neatly, her posture easy and unbothered. There's no side glance, no hesitance. Just a simple nod and the soft beep of the scanner as she rings it up.\n\n \"Appreciate your help,\" your mom says warmly as she pulls out her card.\n\n \"Of course,\" Riley replies, giving a nod before turning to you. \"You made a great choice. First times can feel weird—I get that—but you handled it very well.\"\n\n You shift on your feet a little, unsure where to put the compliment. \"Thanks,\" you murmur, rubbing your palm against the back of your arm.\n\n Your mom gives a final thank-you before turning back to you and Lily. \"Ready?\"\n\n You nod. Lily gives a thumbs-up that's only slightly awkward, like she wants to fist-bump you, but isn't sure if this is the moment for that.\n\n As the three of you walk out of the store together, the bell above the door gives a bright little chime.\n\n Outside, the mall feels different somehow. Not any louder or busier—just a little brighter.\n\n Maybe you are too.\n\n \n You step out of the fitting room, now wearing your top over the bra you chose, the fabric soft and unfamiliar against your skin. It's strange how such a small thing can feel like a milestone. Like a line you didn't know you were ready to cross until you were already standing on the other side of it.\n\n Your mom smiles at you—warm, proud, but not overdoing it. She knows better than to make this moment bigger than you're ready for.\n\n \"That's the one?\" she asks.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you reply, nodding.\n\n She takes it from you with a gentle hand and heads to the counter while you hang back. Riley is already there waiting, hands resting on the counter. She doesn't ask questions or give any weird looks, just rings it up with a practiced ease.\n\n Your mom pays without hesitation.\n\n \"I appreciate your help,\" she tells Riley.\n\n \"Of course,\" Riley replies with a sincere smile. She then turns to you. \"You made a great choice. First times can feel weird, I know, but you handled it really well.\"\n\n You shift slightly, not quite sure what to do with the compliment. \"Thanks,\" you manage.\n\n \"Take your time figuring out what fits,\" she adds. \"Not just the size, but everything. You'll know when something's right.\"\n\n You nod again, eyes lowering slightly. There's something soft in your chest, something that almost feels like relief.\n\n Your mom takes the bag, and you both turn to head out. The bell above the door chimes as you step into the mall again.\n\n The world feels a little brighter than when you first walked in.\n \n\n[Choice: Bra acquired]",

Lily walks a little ahead at first, like she's trying to pretend this wasn't a big deal. But the bounce in her step gives her away.\n\n After a few strides, she slows until she's next to you again. She nudges you lightly with her elbow.\n\n \"So,\" she says, glancing sideways with a smirk just beginning to creep back onto her face, \"now that we're officially past the emotionally delicate bonding part, I'm allowed to tease you again, right?\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but it's not annoyed—more relieved. The energy between you is lighter now, even familiar.\n\n \"I mean, I did see you in a bra,\" she continues, hands shoved in her hoodie pockets. \"That gives me, like, a whole library of jokes I can make now.\"\n\n Your mom chuckles softly beside you, but doesn't interrupt. She knows better than to get in the middle of whatever this is.\n\n You glance at Lily, about to come up with a comeback, but then you see her expression shift slightly—just a flicker of something a little more sincere behind the bravado.\n\n \"Hey,\" she says more quietly now, her voice a little rough around the edges, \"I'm glad you let me come. Like... for real.\" She shrugs, not quiet meeting your eyes. \"You didn't have to. But you did. So... thanks. For trusting me.\"\n\n You're not sure what to say at first. But the words settle in your chest like warmth.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"Thanks for coming.\"\n\n She lifts her chin, regaining her usual swagger. \"Just doing my job as annoying little sister slash emotional support goblin.\"\n\n And with that, she tugs lightly on your sleeve and charges ahead like nothing ever happened.\n\n But something did. And she was there for it.\n\n \n You and your mom make your way back through the mall, weaving past groups of shoppers and the clatter of food court trays until the neon glow of the arcade comes into view. It's loud—flashing lights, electronic jingles, the occasional cheer of someone beating a high school.\n\n Lily is easy to spot. She's parked in front of a claw machine, her hoodie sleeves pushed up as she maneuvers the joystick with intense focus. A pair of plush ducks are just barely within reach, their shiny plastic eyes staring out through the scratched glass like they've accepted their fate.\n\n She doesn't notice you at first, not until the claw descends, misses by a hair, and thuds back into place with a mechanical sigh.\n\n She lets out a soft groan. \"Rigged,\" she mutters, stepping back from the machine.\n\n When she turns and sees you both, she straightens like nothing happened. \"Oh, hey,\" she says, casual, hands stuffed into her hoodie pocket. \"Did that take forever, or was I just in the zone?\"\n\n Your mom smiles gently. \"Not too long.\"\n\n Lily looks you briefly—too briefly—and asks, \"Did it go okay?\" The words are a breeze, like she's just asking how the weather was. But her eyes flick down for a second—to your chest, to the way your top fits now that something is underneath—and then quickly away again.\n\n You nod. \"Yeah,\" you say.\n\n She shrugs, like she doesn't care either way. \"Cool. Guess we can keep shopping now.\"\n\n But there's something quiet in her posture—shoulders a little lower than before, arms tucked in closer to her sides. She doesn't say anything more, and neither do you.\n\n You follow your mom as she turns back toward the main mall hallway, and Lily walks just a step behind instead of beside you like earlier.\n\n It's not a fight. It's not anger. Just distance.\n\n And somehow, that feels so much worse.\n \n\n[Choice: Shopping Spree]",

But only because the anime guys are hot, and if I pull that one of Kaito in the black jacket, I win. Emotionally. Forever.\"\n\nShe folds her arms, dead serious. \"This is art, [name].

It smells faintly like body spray and rebellion.\n\nStepUp Footwear, a staple of the Crestview Bay mall, has so many shoes it nearly makes you dizzy.\n\nCuddle Creations has so many adorable stuffed animals that the cuteness might just overwhelm you.\n\nYour mom nudges you lightly.\n\n\"No wrong answers.

The buzz of chatter, soft music, and footsteps, but there's a gentle calm that wraps around the three of you. It's like finishing the day's errands have stripped away all the anxiety and replaced it with something softer.\n\n\"You did great today, [name],\" Mom says, voice proud and smile steady. \"Really, I'm just so happy to see you shine.\"\n\nYou glance down at the small mountain of shopping bags hanging from your arms—different sizes, soft rustling plastic and paper, all packed with pieces that you chose.\n\nLily bounces on her toes, pacing in tiny circles beside you. Her energy's electric this close to her target. \"Okay, okay, we've shopped your heart out. It's—what?—been hours? My feet are dying, but I don't care. The HonShin Zero pop-up is calling, and I am not letting it go unchallenged.\" Her hands are on her hips, fierce and unrelenting.\n\n\"Alright, sweetheart,\" Mom says, giving Lily a nudge. \"Deep breaths—you'll burst if you don't calm down.\"\n\n\"Nope,\" Lily states, glaring at her. \"No calm until I get those gachapon capsules.\" She makes grabby gestures in the direction where the stand is.\n\nYou smile, shaking your head. She's been talking about this all morning—Honshin Zero, that anime gacha game with its hot guys and holographic photocards—for the past few months. And now? There's no stopping her from exploring every inch of the pop-up.\n\n\"You had a big adventure today, [name],\" Mom says, glancing at your shopping bags. \"I think one little sister quest wouldn't hurt.\"\n\nLily puffs up proudly. \"It definitely wouldn't!\"\n\nYou look down at her, amused but warmed. \"Lead the way,\" you say.\n\nTogether, the three of you start walking across the mall, past the fountains and vending machines to where the rising banners and colorful stands herald the pop-up's location. Lily practically hums with energy, skipping ahead, her voice echoing behind you: \"Wait 'til you see Kaito. He's so hot.\"\n\nYour mom chuckles. \"I didn't expect you to fall in love with a fictional character.\"\n\nLily huffs, but it's affectionate. \"Don't steal my moment, Mom. I need to introduce [name] to Kaito's power. And his arms too, for good measure.\"\n\nYou laugh, and Mom puts a hand on both your shoulders. \"Alright, team. Let's go find some anime magic.\"\n\nWith that, you cross the threshold into the pop-up zone. As you step under the HonShin Zero sign, Lily tugs you forward, eyes bright and focused. Mom matches your pace with gentle grounding steps, and you feel something real settle in your chest. As your own two feet take you forward into whatever comes next, you feel like you belong in this small but profound moment.\n\n[Choice: Gacha]",

Lily practically lunges, eyes wide.\n\n\"There he is,\" she breathes, pointing at a life-size cardboard cutout of Kaito—pale electric-blue hair, wind-swept coat, that practiced-but-intense gaze.\n\nLily steps even closer, almost reverent.\n\n\"His aura... it's so... calm but powerful. Every time I look at him, I feel like he's looking back at me.\" She turns to you and Mom, eyes bright. \"Can I... really try for him?\"\n\nYour mom drifts over and slides a few coins into Lily's palm. \"Go on, sweetheart,\" she says, softly. \"We'll try together, okay?\"\n\nLily's face splits into a grin. \"Okay, full disclosure,\" she says as she power-walks to the machine. \"I looked this up last night. Kaito's only got a 0.8% chance in this set.\" Her voice climbs with urgency. \"That's not just rare, that's criminal. Basically, I'm gambling with my soul here.\"\n\nShe takes a deep breath and heads right for the gachapon machine nearest the Kaito artwork. Coins rattle as she feeds them into the slot. She pulls the handle with all her teenage intensity, her fingers wrapped tightly around the plastic knob.\n\nThe capsule tumbles down. Lily catches it, heart pounding, eyes fixed on the sealed orb. She peels open the plastic, and there's a slight moment—just one breath. Then she gasps and holds it up like a trophy.\n\nIt's him. Kaito, in chibi form, sculpted perfectly. Lily practically clutches it to her chest and declares, grinning: \"He's mine! My husband!\"\n\nYour mom laughs quietly, her joy easy and warm. \"I guess congratulations are in order.\"\n\nLily beams and turns to you, eyes shining with triumph. \"Wait 'til I show him off—he's totally married to me.\" She gives your arm a hearty punch. \"I know you're jealous, [name].\"\n\nBehind you, the pop-up continues its lively dance—bright lights, anime voices drifting in the air, a stream of fans wandering about.

Lily's eyes light up.\n\n \"Dude, we have to do this,\" she insists, practically shoving you toward it. She's already grinning, anticipation written all over her face. \"It'll be hilarious if you're, like, a villain. Or someone really ugly.\"\n\n You slide onto the stool and tap at the screen. The quiz starts with playful prompts: \"What's your battle philosophy?\" \"Pick your favorite snack.\" \"Early bird or night owl?\"\n\n Lily watches your answers with curiosity. \"You better not get Ganyu,\" she teases, arms folded. \"She's too cool. You're not cool.\"\n\n You smile and choose the answers that feel natural. A few taps later, the machine buzzes. The screen swirls with bright lights and dramatic sound effects. Your result appears in bold letters:\n\n KAITO\n\n Lily blinks. You glance over. Her eyes widen and she makes a face of horror.\n\n \"Kaito?\" she squeaks. \"What the hell? You're not Kaito. Whatever, I don't even like him anymore I mean, I can't believe—ugh.\" She waves her hands dramatically as if chasing a fly. \"Congrats, I guess. You can be my husband's sidekick.\"\n\n You grin. \"Sidekick, huh?\"\n\n \"Yeah, 'cause you're definitely not him,\" she says, rolling her eyes. \"Maybe the machine broke or something.\"\n\n You can't help but laugh.\n\n \n You and your mom drift toward the main merch stand, a colorful array of pins, acrylic stands, artbooks, photocards, and more. Lily's off chasing Kaito again, leaving just the two of you. It feels calm—like a gentle pause in the pop-up chaos.\n\n You pick up a small acrylic charm: a slender bow and arrow in icy-blue hues, reminiscent of Ganyu. You hold it up, studying the fine lines and holographic sparkle.\n\n Mom peers over your shoulder. \"That's lovely,\" she says softly. \"You know, it reminds me of something I watched when I was younger.\"\n\n You glance at her, curious.\n\n She picks up a pin shaped like a crescent moon tiara—its curve elegant, silver, almost glowing in the light.\n\n \"I used to watch this show called Moonlight Maiden every Saturday morning,\" she continues, voice drifting back decades. \"It was about a girl named Luna. She had some planetary powers and defended Earth from evil shadow creatures. She had a tiara like this one. Her cat companion—Mr. Whiskers—gave her her powers. I loved that show.\"\n\n She chuckles, sliding the pin gently across the display. \"There was always a dramatic transformation scene and a 'love conquers all' theme. Kinda cheesy, but I was hooked.\"\n\n You watch as she handles the pin like a keepsake, not just a trinket.\n\n \"I guess buying stuff here isn't just about the characters,\" she says quietly. \"It's about the moments we carry with us—like watching Moonlight Maiden when I was your age.\"\n\n You nod. You're not sure why, but those words hit hard.\n\n \n You shift the weight of your bags and eye the life-size Kaito cutout—the perfect backdrop. You clear your throat, a soft invitation. \"Hey... wanna do a quick family photo? Like, with Kaito?\"\n\n Lily's head snaps up, her excitement palpable. \"Yes! You get it, [name]. It's like... my official wedding album—because Kaito's totally my husband, obviously.\"\n\n \"Your wedding album?\" Mom asks, arching an eyebrow.\n\n \"Yeah,\" Lily says, nodding emphatically. She steps forward to stand beside the cutout. \"We need to document this sacred contract.\"\n\n You pull out your phone and switch to the front-facing camera. The small lens reflects your face for a moment—then you raise your arm, angling the phone just right. \"Okay, Kaito's cutting into the top of the frame. Lean in.\"\n\n Lily theatrically scoots closer to the cardboard Kaito, placing her hand around its waist. Her grin is huge, eyes shining. \"Mom, get in here!\" she commands with a grin. She gestures dramatically as if conducting a crowd.\n\n Mom steps around Lily, her arm settling gently around her daughter's shoulder. \"Like this?\"\n\n \"Perfect,\" you say, trying not to grin too wide. \"Now me.\"\n\n You edge forward, your arm stretching to encompass everyone. Lily juts her chin up and says, \"Everyone smile!\"\n\n None of you have to smile—you've been doing it all along. You tap the button three times to make sure you got a good one.\n\n Click. Click. Click.\n \n On the small screen, you see it: Lily, triumphant; Mom, radiant; you—smiling, real, comfortable. Kaito frozen in cardboard smugness in the center of it all.\n\n Lily claps her hand, jumping a little. \"We nailed it. That's our first wedding pic!\"\n\n Mom laughs softly, brushing Lily's hair back. \"I think we made wedding album history today.\"\n\n You tuck your phone back into your pocket, but the smile lingers. It's just a silly photo, sure, but it feels like something more—like a tiny snapshot of something good. And for today, here in the center of a chaotic pop-up, it's yours.\n\n \n \n You signal to Lily and Mom that you're going somewhere else for a minute—your voice soft so you don't disturb the pop-up peace. Lily shrugs in her own way, nodding and looking at more Kaito, while Mom watches you with an understanding smile. Without a word, you slip through the crowd toward a quieter corner of the space—a secluded gallery area labeled: Concept Art & Storytelling.\n\n The lighting softens here, and the buzz of the gachapon machines fades behind you. A series of tall panels line the walls, each showcasing high-quality art from HonShin Zero. You pause in front of one: Ganyu. She's a graceful archer with blue hair and an elegant outfit that helped skyrocket her popularity.\n\n The portrait captures her in mid-motion—bow drawn, luminescent glyphs swirling around her in delicate, icy-blue arcs. You remember seeing her gameplay once, but seeing her rendered here, larger than life, stirs something in your chest.\n\n You glide your fingers just above the surface of the print, careful not to touch. You can't help but appreciate the strokes—the tiny flourishes of hair, the folds in her clothes, the soft glow of her cheek. You study the way the light kisses her skin, how her eyes seem so alive.\n\n It's... amazing. The amount of talent and skill that went into capturing not just a character, but a personality.\n\n You move along the panels, slower now, pausing at character design sheets—expressions, costume ideas, weapon ideas—each framed like a window into creation itself. For a moment, you step back and consider if you could ever draw like this.\n\n Maybe someday if you practiced.\n\n The soft murmur of Lily's voice drifts faintly from the crowd, calling you back. Your breath settles, and you end up standing in that corner a moment longer. You let the art speak to you, hoping it leaves a spark in you—one that you just might follow someday.\n \n Only then do you turn away.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

I need food.\"\n\n\"Same here,\" you concur. \"I could eat the entire court if I had to.\"\n\nMom chuckles, folding her arms around her purse. \"Let's do it then.

      "text": "Your group of three carefully weave through the crowds until you reach a tucked-away table by a tall fake plant. The food court buzzes all around—laughter, trays clattering, the whirr of soda machine, and the comfort scent of everything fried, grilled, or baked in bulk.\n\nMom drops her purse onto a plastic chair with a tired but contented sigh, casting an affectionate glance at the heap of shopping bags resting against your legs. \"Wow—look at that pile,\" she murmurs. \"We did some damage today, huh?\"\n\nYou settle into your seat across from her, stretching your arms like you've just walked a marathon. \"Worth it though,\" you agree, glancing at your haul with a satisfied grin.\n\nLily perches on the edge of another chair, holding her Kaito figure like it's a gold medal. \"So, what are we getting?\" she asks. \"I wonder if any restaurant sells dino nuggets...\"\n\nMom reaches into her wallet, pulls out her card, and places it gently on the middle of the table. \"Alright. You two can go get whatever you want. Meal, drink, dessert—anything. You earned it today.\"\n\nYou look at the card in surprise. \"Anything?\"\n\nShe offers a firm nod. \"Do I look like I'm joking? Go. I'll watch the bags.\"\n\nLily glances up excitedly. \"Hey! I want what you're getting, [name]. I'll come with you.\"\n\n\"Let's go on the hunt,\" you say, smile growing.\n\nLily pumps a fist, nearly tipping her chair. \"Yeah. No backing out.\"\n\nYou glance toward the ring of food stalls. There are more than a dozen places lit up in neon lights and grease-scented glory. A few kids race past yelling about honey mustard. Somewhere nearby, a blender screeches through a smoothie.\n\nMom leans back, folds her arms, and grins. \"But seriously,\" she says gently. \"Try to get something that won't give you a stomachache later.\"\n\nYou grin in return, shoulders squared. \"No promises.\"\n\nShe just laughs, shaking her head. \"Go on,\" she states simply, waving you both off.\n\n\"Sooo,\" Lily begins, tugging at your sleeve as you get up. \"Where are we going?\"\n\nPizza Hüt is a proud European chain that acts like putting an umlaut in the name makes their pizza cultured. The pizza's fine, but the crust is oddly sweet and the pepperoni looks like it was printed on. It's the kind of spot you eat at and then wonder if maybe you were just really hungry.\n\nLoud branding, flat burgers, and enough sauce to coat your soul. That's Burgur Kween. The combo deals are suspiciously cheap, and everything comes wrapped in foil with marketing slogans like \"SLAY THE CRAVE.\" It doesn't help the fact that their burgers look like they've been sat on, though.\n\nKansas Fried Poultry is the home of greasy chicken and coleslaw no one ever finishes. It was founded by General Thatch, whose portrait still hangs in every location—white suit, bolo tie, and a thousand-yard stare. They swear by their \"Legendary Eleven-Dust Blend™\"—you're pretty sure most of the taste comes down to the MSG though. No one knows what's in the gravy, but you eat it anyway. General Thatch would want you to be brave.\n\nTacko Bong is Tex-Mex, but barely. You order it because it smells good, then immediately question your decisions mid-bite. It's fast, cheap, and tastes decent going in. But let's be honest here—you know what happens next. There's a reason why every bathroom stall near a Tacko Bong is mysteriously out of order.\n\nKoala Express is an aggressively average Chinese fast-food chain that's somehow in every mall, airport, and food court, even though no one remembers it actually opening. The food is comforting in a suspiciously consistent way. The real mystery is the mascot: a grinning koala in a silk robe, holding chopsticks. No one knows why exactly an Australian marsupial is representing orange chicken, and the brand has never explained it. You're not here for the authenticity though—you're here because it smells good and hits the same way every time.\n\n[Choice: Pizza Hüt]\n[Choice: Burgur Kween]\n[Choice: KFP - Kansas Fried Poultry]\n[Choice: Tacko Bong]\n[Choice: Koala Express]",

      "text": "You and Lily approach the glowing red sign of Pizza Hüt—\"Est. in Düsseldorf\" proudly serifed underneath. It feels like you've stepped into a bunker of bread discipline. The staff behind the counter all wear crisp red aprons and stare ahead like they've been trained in the harshest of culinary bootcamps.\n\n A tall, severe man steps forward. His nametag reads GÜNTER, and his expression is firm. He doesn't smile. You're not sure if you want him to.\n\n \"Willkommen to ze Hüt,\" he says, with zero inflection. \"You vill be having ze pizza, ya?\"\n\n Lily clears her throat. \"Um, yeah. I want a slice of peppero—\"\n\n Günter interrupts. \"Peperoniwurst,\" he corrects, like he's issuing a royal decree.\n\n \"The fuck?\" Lily mutters under her breath.\n\n You glance at the menu to see what you should get. It's technically English, but everything has been rebranded for maximum faux-European flair: Zauce, Krustenplatte, Mozarrela der Schmeltz. There's even a combo called \"Die Trilogie der Käse.\" It's just a three-cheese pizza.\n\n You ask about drinks. He doesn't speak. He simply slides a can of room-temperature orange soda across the counter. The label is peeled halfway off; it doesn't fizz. You're not convinced it's carbonated—or legal.\n\n Meanwhile, Lily leans in, whispering in a conspiratorial tone: \"They don't mess around here, do they? This place is like—pizza military base.\"\n\n \"It's no-nonsense pizza,\" you whisper back, scared that Günter will overhear. \"I respect that.\"\n\n Five minutes later, two slices arrive on a cardboard tray printed with the phrase \"Life ist kurz. Eat die Hüt.\" There's a single parsley leaf on each pizza.\n\n You both carry your food back to the table. Mom raises an eyebrow at you two while taking a sip of iced tea. \"Pizza Hüt, huh?\" she says. \"How was the culture?\"\n\n Lily shrugs dramatically. \"It's... stern. Like pepperoni with a side of discipline.\"\n\n You lay your tray down. \"Very effishent, ja,\" you say, adopting your best Günter impression.\n\n Mom leans forward. \"Parsley?\"\n\n \"It's cultural, apparently,\" you shrug. \"I don't know, you're too American to get it.\"\n\n Lily takes a cautious bite. Chew. \"The sauce is weirdly sweet.\" Another chew. \"And the crust is tougher than Günter's stare.\"\n\n You take a bite. The crust is firm, the sauce unnervingly saccharine, the pepperoni obedient. \"It's fine. It works. The Hüt delivers.\"\n\n There is no joy, only structure and the faint scent of oregano.\n\n \n You and Lily step under the neon crown of Burgur Kween and are immediately hit by a wave of flame-grilled aroma, sizzling grease, and a touch of theatricality. Purple spotlights cast a glow over the counter and the soda machine thunders out upbeat pop music. This place doesn't whisper confidence, it shouts it.\n\n \"This is awesome, [name], Lily says, practically bouncing at your side. \"It's like we walked into a burger stage show.\"\n\n Behind the counter stands Miss Patty—a tall server with gleaming gold hoops, immaculate acrylic nails, and an apron that looks more like a costume than a uniform. Their name tag is festive too, handwritten in Sharpie and topped off with a playful lipstick kiss.\n\n \"Welcome to Burgur Kween, darlings,\" Miss Patty drawls, sweeping a hand in greeting. \"What's the vibe today? Are we feeling classic? Deluxe? Or just full-on drama?\"\n\n \"I'll take... just a cheeseburger,\" you say.\n\n Miss Patty arches an amused eyebrow. \"Just? Oh honey, we don't do 'just' here. We do bold. Juicy. Life-changing.\"\n\n You look up at the menu, which is a fever dream of specials with names like \"The Glam Stack,\" \"Double Drama,\" and \"The Untucked Combo.\"\n\n You're holding in laughter, but you manage to smile and speak up. \"Alright, I'll take the Classic Kween Cheeseburger with fries. And a mango soda, please.\"\n\n Miss Patty claps their hands theatrically. \"Yes! You don't need extra sauce, sweetness. You bring the flavor.\"\n\n \"Then I'm diving right into the Double Drama Deluxe. That's the two-patty with onion rings. I want the glitter dust too. Lots of it.\"\n\n \"That's a queen's choice!\" Miss Patty snaps their fingers. \"Drop the royal stack and crown it, darling!\"\n\n When the fries sizzle in the fryer behind them, Patty slides your receipt across the counter with a teasing flourish. \"Grab a straw with attitude—something that matches your vibe.\"\n\n Lily hovers, eyeing a rainbow of striped straws. She picks a red one with a flounce. \"This one's totally me.\"\n\n You grab a purple-striped straw that just feels right.\n\n The kitchen clangs in approval and your trays arrive: the Classic Kween Cheeseburger sits snug next to golden fries and a soda on yours.\n\n Lily scoops up her tray like a trophy. \"Dude, this is gonna be legendary.\"\n\n Back at the table, out of the sensory explosion, your mom waits for you both. Her iced tea sits gently in the cup holder.\n\n Lily slides into her seat, onion rings with glitter dust steaming in the tray. She eyes them with reverence. \"They... look amazing. And listen to that crunch.\" She bites in and closes her eyes. \"Mhm—yeah. Total jackpot.\"\n\n You unwrap your burger carefully—the cheese still melted at the seams. You lean back in your seat and grin. \"That restaurant was crazy. Miss Patty was full-on performance art.\"\n\n Mom laughs softly, nabbing a french fry between her fingers. \"You don't go to Burgur Kween for the taste. I could watch the theatrics all day.\"\n\n \"Everything's over-the-top,\" Lily says, nodding. \"I love it.\"\n\n Your mom glances between you and Lily, pride shining in her eyes. \"I'm really glad you two enjoyed the experience.\" She nudges her cup gently, sipping the tea.\n\n You pick up a fry and raise it like a toast. \"To royal burgers and dramatic straws.\"\n\n Lily raises her drink against yours with a grin. \"To Burgur Kween!\"\n\n Mom lifts her iced tea. \"To our little adventures.\"\n\n And together, the three of you lean into the chaotic comfort of a food court meal.\n\n \n You step into the smoky scent thrumming from Kansas Fried Poultry—a wild swirl of grease, black pepper, and that unapologetic fried-chicken defiance. It perches in the mall food court like a legend, crowned by the silhouette of Kansas wearing a cowboy hat. Framed portraits of General Thatch—legendary founder and spirited icon—glower from the walls. A tattered Stars-and-Stripes flutters behind the counter, worn but proud.\n\n \"[name], this place smells like victory,\" Lily states, nudging you.\n\n Behind the counter, leaning over the register like she owns it all, stands Mary-Beth. Her name tag's nearly faded off, and her apron looks like it survived a cornbread cannon explosion.\n\n \"Well, howdy there, darlin's,\" she drawls, voice heavy with Southern cheer. \"Y'all look like you came here for more than a salad—bless your hearts. Lemme take care of you proper.\"\n\n Before you or Lily can ask for the menu, she slaps her hand on the counter. \"We don't do menus here,\" she says firmly, reading your mind. \"We do chicken—hot as a jalapeño sermon and proud as a peacock.\"\n\n \"Hey!\" she tuns around and hollers to the kitchen. \"Drop two thighs, two drumsticks, a side of those taters, and two mercy biscuits! Y'all are gonna need strength to survive this blessing.\"\n\n She spins back to you, grinning wide. \"Everything's comin' right up. Don't worry 'bout nothin'—I got y'all.\"\n\n Lily tries to ask a question, but Mary-Beth raises a finger: \"If it ain't fried, it ain't invited. Now scoot on over to that cooler and grab yourselves something bubbly—sweet tea, orange fizz, go wild.\"\n\n By the time you return from the fridge, Mary-Beth has your order ready.\n\n \"Y'all enjoy now,\" Mary-Beth says, wiping her hands on a rag that might've fought in the war. \"And if it don't light a fire in yer chest, we'll bury ya with honor.\"\n\n At your table by the fake plant, Mom stirs her iced tea and watches with a fond, amused smile as Lily as you unload the bounty.\n\n Lily gently pokes a drumstick. \"Dude, this is majestic,\" she breathes, awed. \"Look at that skin—like sun-tanned armor.\"\n\n You peel back the bucket lid, and a cloud of steam swirls into your face. \"It's... amazing,\" you say softly. \"General Thatch would be proud.\"\n\n \"A true American icon,\" Mom says, chuckling.\n\n You pick up a thigh, the skin crackling beneath your fingertips. One bit sends a thunderclap of flavor through your mouth—the spice, the crisp, and the juice.\n\n Lily crunches into her drumstick with a triumphant smack. \"Mary-Beth judged our souls good and proper.\"\n\n You all laugh as you enjoy the warm comfort that only a ridiculous, messy, southern-fried family moment can bring.\n\n \n The closer you get to Tacko Bong, the more the air feels like a late-night dorm room—warmed-over tortilla chips, stale microwaved goodness, and a hazy, laid-back buzz. A faded mural of a cool cactus wearing a beanie, gripping a burrito like it's its only friend, adorns the wall. A little sign on the register reads: \"Now Hiring. No Snitches.\" The place reeks of chaotic comfort—a perfect storm of cheesy indulgence and casual slacker energy.\n\n Behind the counter, a guy stands half-shadowed under the neon glow. He's got a bandana tied low on his forehead, hot sauce packets clipped to his belt like ammo, and eyes so half-lidded he looks like he's buffering. His name tag, scrawled sloppily in Sharpie, reads \"Chaz.\"\n\n He stares at you for a moment, then blinks slowly. \"Yo...\" he intones. \"You hungry?\"\n\n You nod once. Chaz nods back. \"That's sick. Me too.\" No menus here—just taped photos of a Cruncho Loco Supreme, Nacho Nacho Situation, and the Mystery Quesadilla (No Refunds).\n\n Lily glances up at the board, eyebrows twitching. \"So... what's any of that?\"\n\n \"I can, like... throw some stuff in a tortilla?\" Chaz offers. \"We got beans. Probably.\"\n\n A second guy appears from the back. You didn't hear him come out. His name tag says \"Spoon\", and he's holding a ladle full of neon-yellow cheese like it's a sacred artifact.\n\n \"You want the drip?\" Spoon asks. \"We got the drip.\"\n\n \"The drip?\" you say, voice cautious.\n \n He holds up the ladle. \"This is the drip,\" Spoon says simply.\n\n Chaz nods solemnly after him.\n\n You glance at Lily—she's intrigued, but wary.\n\n \"Okay, I'll... just take whatever you have,\" you say, handing over the card.\n\n The two of them go off to assemble your food with ritual-like slowness, scooping mystery fillings, layering cheese lovingly, and wrapping it all in tortillas.\n\n When they hand you the bundle, Chaz flashes a smile. \"That drip means it's good.\"\n\n \"What even is this?\" Lily asks, peering at the burrito-adjacent...thing in tin foil.\n\n \"I dunno,\" you admit as you and Lily grab drinks and head back to Mom at your table by the big fake plant.\n\n Mom looks up from her iced tea, concern flickering in her eyes as your package leaks onto the table. \"Is it safe?\"\n\n \"The guy who made it called it 'a transcendental bean event,' so...\"\n\n \"So...\" Mom drags, blinking. \"What you're saying is it's not safe.\"\n\n It's Lily who laughs first. \"Tacko Bong employees are high,\" she says, shaking her head in mock disappointment. \"Who knew?\"\n\n \"I guess it's part of the experience,\" you respond, shrugging.\n\n You tear into your burrito, and it's surprisingly delicious. The first bite floods your mouth with a riot of spice, cheese, and beans.\n\n \"Holy crap,\" Lily exclaims, eyes going wide. \"This is actually kinda awesome.\"\n\n \"I'll take your word for it,\" Mom says with a glimmer in her eyes. \"You two might need a week to recover, though.\"\n\n \"Oh, yeah,\" you say in between bites. \"It's gonna wreck us.\"\n\n Lily smirks and nods. \"Totally worth it, though.\"\n\n The both of you dig in, the chaotic comfort of the sloppy food and that surreal energy turning into a strangely wholesome family moment.\n\n \n You spot the golden cat near the counter first, its paw looping slowly, like a silent invitation. The red-and-gold menu board lists endless combos: two entrées and a side, served on trays so wide they look designed for an entire village.\n\n Lily and you step toward the counter. She stares at the towering trays of orange chicken, beef and broccoli, and fried rice piled like a mountain. \"Wow,\" she breathes. \"These portions are... insane. I'm not sure I can even eat this much.\"\n\n \"You can always try,\" you say, grinning. \"If you're full, I can take the rest.\"\n\n The server greets you both without missing a beat. \"Welcome to Koala Express. Combo or box?\"\n\n \"Combo,\" you say first. \"I'll take orange chicken and beef and broccoli, with fried rice.\"\n\n Lily fidgets in place for a second before answering: \"I'll do combo too—black pepper chicken and shrimp egg roll. And... can I get chow mein?\"\n\n \"Good choice,\" the server says neutrally, scooping the selections onto two trays. The food gets piled high, the team carrying a heady aroma of soy, sugar, and savory promise. The plastic lid has to be taped on, the poor thing struggling.\n\n Your mom is waiting for you at the table, iced tea in hand. She waves you both over with a small, content smile.\n\n Arms trembling slightly under the weight of your tray, you and Lily make your way to the table. Mom lifts an eyebrow at the sheer volume of food. \"That's... quite a haul.\"\n\n Lily sets her tray down carefully. \"It's huge,\" she says, awe and doubt circling her voice. \"Like, I don't actually know if I can finish this.\"\n\n You pull out your fortune cookie, peel it, and crack it open. The paper is smudged and slightly torn, but still legible:\n You are full of potential. And also rice.\n\n \"Here—fortune cookie says I have potential,\" you say, chuckling.\n\n Mom laughs and lifts her cup. \"That you do.\"\n\n Lily exhales and digs in, wobbling a mix of Chinese onto her fork. \"Okay, okay, this is good,\" she admits around a bite of chow mein. \"Black pepper chicken?\" she offers a piece to you. \"Try it.\"\n\n Koala Express offers a certain kind of comforting chaos you didn't quiet expect.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "You glance sideways at Lily, who's messing with her phone, thumb scrolling aimlessly, then you smirk.\n\n \"So,\" you say, voice casual but loud enough to cut through the quiet, \"since we're headed to the mall, it seems like a good time to remind everyone about that very special trip years ago...\"\n\n Lily freezes, eyes snapping up. \"Don't.\"\n\n You lean back, arms behind your head, fully committing. \"The one where someone got dramatically, epically, horrifically lost in the mall food court for—what was it?—an hour?\"\n\n \"It was twenty minutes,\" she snaps. \"And I was literally five or something.\"\n\n You ignore her. \"She disappeared mid-bite of an Auntie Agnes's pretzel. It was like a vanishing act. One second she was there, happily devouring dough, the next—poof. Gone. Like a tiny, churro-powered cryptid.\"\n\n Your mom laughs from the front seat. \"Oh, I remember. I aged a decade that day. Security had to make an announcement over the loudspeaker. 'Missing little girl, East Asian with black hair and brown eyes'—and Lily was apparently just sitting inside Cuddle Creations, sobbing because she saw one of the plushies without any stuffing. Just the floppy skin.\"\n\n Lily groans, dragging her hands down her face. \"It was horrifying, alright? It looked like a deflated animal crime scene. I was a kid, okay? I didn't know.\"\n\n You grin wider. \"You told the employee you were a princess from The Chronicles of Vamira.\"\n\n Lily turns to you, dead serious. \"[name], in that moment, I was Princess Sparkles. Sparkles had confidence. Sparkles didn't cry when she realized she was lost.\"\n\n \"Oh, you definitely cried,\" you say. \"I remember because your eyes were all red and you made Mom carry you around for the rest of the trip.\"\n\n \"She made me promise we'd never speak of it again, you know?\" your mom chimes in.\n\n \"Yeah, thanks for that, by the way,\" Lily mutters, glaring at you. \"Truly a betrayal of sacred childhood trust.\"\n\n You just shrug. \"It's kind of your fault for trusting me.\"\n\n She glares harder. \"Okay, but how about we talk about the time you fell asleep inside a clothing rack because you were 'tired of society' and then screamed when a mannequin fell on you?\"\n\n You freeze. \"That never happened.\"\n\n \"Oh, it definitely did,\" Lily says triumphantly. \"Mom took pictures.\"\n\n Your mom hums innocently from the front. \"Still on my phone. Somewhere.\"\n\n Lily leans back, smug. \"Princess Sparkles rests her case.\"\n\n You shake her head, trying not to smile, and lightly bump your knee against hers. She bumps you right back without looking up.\n\n The car turns into the mall parking lot just as a gust of wind sends a swirl of leaves skittering past the windshield. Despite all the teasing, you can't help but feel warm in your chest. Lily's laughing. You're laughing. And for once, everything feels just a little easier. A little more like it used to be.\n\n \n You lean your head against the cool window, watching the blur of neighborhoods pass by. Then, almost without thinking, you ask, \"Do you guys ever feel like time's just... moving way too fast?\"\n\n The question hangs there for a moment.\n\n Your mom glances at you in the rearview mirror, brows lifting slightly. \"Where's that coming from?\"\n\n You shrug, still watching the trees go by. \"I don't know. It just feels like everything's happening all at once lately. School, college stuff, people changing. I blink and the day's already over. I used to think everything took forever. Now it's like I can't catch up.\"\n\n There's a quiet pause.\n\n \"I feel that,\" your mom says, her voice softer now. \"More than you probably think.\" She turns the wheel with one hand as the car curves onto a familiar road, the tires humming on the pavement. \"When I was your age, it felt like I was racing toward something—adulthood, I guess. And now? It's like I hit that mark, and everything just... kept going. Faster. Like the moment I got used to one phase of life, it was already moving onto the next.\"\n\n Lily frowns a little, leaning back in her seat. \"I don't know. I feel like school days still drag. Like, math class is a decade long.\"\n\n Your mom smiles at her through the mirror. \"That's fair. Life moves differently when you're fourteen. When I was your age, I thought twenty-five was ancient.\"\n\n \"Twenty-five is ancient,\" Lily scoffs.\n\n Your mom laughs, shaking her head. \"Thanks for that.\"\n\n Lily shrugs, trying to hide her grin. \"I just don't think about that stuff much yet. I still feel like... I don't know, like everything's just beginning.\"\n\n \"That's exactly it,\" your mom says quietly. \"It is beginning. For both of you. But the thing about beginnings is, they don't announce when they're ending. You just notice later that they did. And that's when you start wondering where the time went.\"\n\n You glance over at Lily. She's looking out the window too now, eyebrows scrunched just slightly, like she's trying to understand something just out of reach.\n\n You nod slowly. \"Yeah. I guess I'm just realizing I'm not really going to be here much longer. Like, home. With you guys. And I thought I'd feel ready, but... sometimes I don't.\"\n\n \"You don't have to be ready all at once, [name],\" your mom states. \"Life doesn't ask that of you. But it will keep moving, whether you're ready or not. I guess that's why moments like this matter more than they seem.\"\n\n The car feels quiet again, but it's not empty. It's full of something heavier—something real. The kind of silence that comes when people are thinking about the same thing, even if they're not saying it.\n\n A few houses later, your mom adds, \"And for what it's worth... I feel lucky I still get days like this. Just the three of us, driving to the mall like time hasn't changed a single thing.\"\n\n You smile at that, and when you look at Lily again, she meets your eyes for a second and offers a small nod.\n\n And even though nothing's been solved, and the future's still rushing toward you like it always has, the car keeps rolling forward—now with the soft comfort of knowing you're not alone in the feeling.\n\n \n You let the silence hang just long enough to feel like you're about to say something really important. Then:\n\n \"Okay. Zombie apocalypse. Who dies first?\"\n\n Lily doesn't even look up from her phone. \"You.\"\n\n \"Really?\" you ask, blinking. \"No hesitation?\"\n\n \"Not even a second,\" she says, casually swiping through Instagram. \"You wouldn't even survive one night, actually. You'd get distracted trying to find a charger for your phone so you can keep texting your sad little group chat with the only two friends you have.\"\n\n That one stings.\n\n \"At least I don't think I'm going to defeat zombies with angry eyeliner.\"\n\n Lily whips to look at you, scandalized. \"This is winged eyeliner, thank you, and it's sharp enough to kill.\"\n\n \"Emotionally, maybe.\"\n\n From the driver's seat, your mom lets out a long, weary sigh that only parents can achieve. \"Do I really need to remind you two that I have the car, the emergency flashlight, and the granola bars? I'm surviving this apocalypse whether you're in it or not.\"\n\n \"Mom, the emergency flashlight has been out of batteries since I was a baby,\" Lily states, deadpan. \"You're not surviving either.\"\n\n \"Definitely not,\" you agree.\n\n \"Is it really out of batteries?\" your mom asks, frowning.\n\n \"Lily, you're not one to talk,\" you state. \"You would literally argue with a zombie, then get bit.\"\n\n Lily gasps. \"I would not!\"\n\n \"Didn't you literally argue with a seagull last year when we went to the pier?\"\n\n \"It was smug!\" Lily says, volume rising. \"It took my churro and then stared into my soul.\"\n\n \"You swore at it and got in trouble.\"\n\n Lily crosses her arms but she's grinning. \"Better than that time you climbed up on the shed to 'get better signal' and got stuck up there for two hours because a raccoon knocked down the ladder.\"\n\n You open your mouth, then close it again, defeated.\n\n Your mom, still driving, laughs. \"And the two of you said I'm not surviving?\"\n\n \"You might survive,\" Lily says sincerely. \"But you'd get your settlement to follow chore charts and schedules.\"\n\n \"Well I'm sorry that I believe in structure,\" your mom says, mock-wounded.\n\n \"You know, I think Mom could weaponize towels,\" you say. \"Like roll them up and whip zombies in the face. It's not the worst strategy, if you really think about it.\"\n\n Lily giggles, nudging your shoulder gently. You bump her right back, a silent little exchange that says \"I'm glad you're here.\"\n\n The car turns into the mall parking lot, the building looming ahead like a fluorescent castle full of overpriced clothing and food. The laughter in the car fades into a content kind of quiet, the kind that sits comfortably between people who know each other way too well—and like each other anyway.\n \n\n[Choice: Shopping begin!]",

The hum of distant conversations and the scraping of forks fill the air, wrapping you in a gentle, ordinary comfort. Your mom gives you both a fond smile and rises.\n\n\"I'll grab my meal,\" she says, casting a quick flash at each of you. \"Enjoy yourselves. I'll be back in a flash.\"\n\nShe drifts off into the crowd, leaving you and Lily alone together.\n\nSuddenly the space between you feels softer, quieter. Lily fiddles with the edge of her tray, eyes fixed on the food she's barely started. After a moment, she clears her throat. \"Hey... [name]?\" Her voice is small, hesitant, but steady.\n\nYou look up from your own tray and catch her gaze. Her cheeks are slightly pink—not from embarrassment, exactly, but like she's exposing something raw and honest about herself.\n\nShe shifts, uncomfortable, then speaks again. \"I—uh, I was thinking... we used to spend, like, all of our time together. Do you remember? School festivals, the camping trip, that summer when we were parked in front of the console?\" She pauses, searching your face. \"And now... I don't know. We barely talk. We're in the same house but... it's like we're a million miles away.\"\n\nShe looks away, biting her lip. Her fingers tap lightly on the tray in front of her—nervous rhythm. Her voice is softer this time.\n\n\"I miss how easy it was, you know? How you'd help me with my homework, or when I'd tell you dumb stuff and you'd laugh—even when it wasn't that funny. We just... we used to be close. Today reminded me of that.\"\n\nShe glances back at you, eyes shining with uncertainty. \"And now I don't even know if we're... I mean, are we still even friends?\"\n\nThe words hang between you, gentle but heavy. Lily's shoulders are hunched, a small sign of how much courage it took to say this. You forget that she's still fourteen sometimes. She's reaching out in the only way she really knows how—awkwardly, honestly, vulnerably.\n\nThe food court noise continues around you, but both of you are in this quieter bubble now. You sense Lily's heart on the table, raw and waiting for your answer.\n\nThis moment matters, and it's up to you to respond:\n\n[Choice: Of course we're still friends]\n[Choice: Not anymore]",

      "text": "You pause, the weight of Lily's question lingering amid the soft clatter of the food court. Taking a deep breath, you lean forward, catching her gaze. \"Of course we're still friends, Lils,\" you say, voice steady but warm. \"We're siblings, and I'm really glad we've been reconnecting lately.\"\n\n Lily freezes. She blinks at you, mouth opening slightly, as if your words surprised her in the best possible way. Then she exhales and smiles—a gentle, relieved curve that seems to lift years of distance off her shoulders. The tension that's been building between you both eases, filtered down until all that remains is the safe space of shared laughter and familiarity.\n\n \"Really?\" she asks, surprise giving way to confidence. She scoots a little closer. \"Like... even if I get super annoying? Or I say stupid things?\" Her brows knit together comically, the moment between you suddenly playful, as though the fear of separation had been ballooning until popped by that single affirmation.\n\n \"Especially then,\" you joke softly. \"You're stuck with me forever, face it.\"\n\n She giggles—light and genuine. \"Awesome, 'cause you're stuck with me too.\" Her tone shifts just a shade more serious. \"Thanks, [name].\" She glances away, chewing on the corner of her lip. \"Today's been really fun. I missed... this.\" She doesn't elaborate. She doesn't need to.\n\n Neither does the long, warm pause that follows. You and Lily take a deliberate bite, and as you chew, the food tastes sweeter. Almost as if it's been flavored by this moment of restored connection.\n\n \"Do you remember that time we built a pillow castle fort in the living room?\" you ask, and Lily's shoulder lift with a laugh.\n\n \"I was the queen,\" Lily says, folding a napkin in half. \"You were the knight.\" She rolls her eyes fondly. \"And I made you eat the 'royal gruel'—AKA chicken nuggets in gravy—and you pretended to like it, even though it was cold and disgusting.\"\n\n Your grin grows. \"Look, I didn't hate it—okay, maybe I did—but you made it with solemn ceremony.\"\n\n \"It absolutely was solemn!\" Lily says, elbowing you gently.\n\n As you laugh and reminisce, neither of you notices how lighter the air feels. That long-ago closeness, buried under busy days and drifting summers, is slowly returning.\n\n That's when your mom returns. She slides into the seat opposite of you, her tray in hand, and pauses with a soft smile on her face. \"You two look... happy,\" she says, eyes flicking to your bright faces. \"What's going on over here? I was only gone for a few minutes.\"\n\n You and Lily just exchange a knowing glance.\n\n \n \n You hold the words as if they were sharp stones in your mouth: \"Not anymore.\" The sentence seems to echo in the quiet of the food court, louder than any shouted argument.\n\n Lily freezes. You see it—the shock, the sense of loss—swallowing her disappointment before it can break. Her hand trembles, barely brushing the tray. She forces herself to respond quietly, voice like glass. \"Oh.\"\n\n But that \"oh\" is like a cave collapsing. She glances up, trying to steady herself. You reach for her, but draw back. It's too late for comfort—too late for words.\n\n \"I... I thought,\" Lily mumbles, voice cracking, \"because... I don't know... with us chatting and then actually.... shopping together today...\" Her words tumble out, awkward, fragmented, heavy with hope. \"I thought maybe we were getting back... closer.\"\n\n She looks at you, betrayed. Her eyes glisten with tears she refuses to let fall. Her voice fractures. \"I really thought that.\"\n\n You swallow. You want to tell her how important today has been, how precious her being here is, how sorry you are that those words spilled out. But all you manage is a trembling whisper: \"I didn't mean it like that. Today was... important.\"\n\n Her shoulders slump—as though she's carrying a weight she never expected. She barely nods, quietly turning back to her food. She doesn't speak again. The air between you grows colder, thick with regret.\n\n A few awkward minutes pass. She continues picking at the food, but her appetite has disappeared. The silence stretches, broken only by distant footfalls and the hum of conversation too light, too happy for this table.\n\n Then your mom returns, tray in hand, her eyes flicking between the two of you. She sets her items down softly and slides into her seat. Concern gathers in her expression like dark clouds. She looks at both of you, voice gentle. \"What happened between you two?\"\n\n Both of you turn toward her. Your heart pounds. You open your mouth, but words don't come out. Lily stares at the table, lips pressed together. It's clear she wants to reach out, but something inside won't let her. She just sits there, her expression sad.\n\n And in that moment—under the harsh food court lights, amidst the chatter and clatter—something shifts. The day's fragile hope fractures, and you both find yourself at a quiet line, unsure how to bridge the gap that's opened wide between you.\n \n\n[Choice: The drive home]",

The overhead lights cast long, drifting reflections across the car's interior, lending a soft warmth to the moment.\n\n In the front, Mom keeps the car steady, a small, pleased smile curling her lips. You catch the corner of her eye in the rearview mirror, and it's enough—a silent affirmation that tonight, everything is okay.\n\n \"So, Lils,\" you begin, nudging Lily playfully. \"Which store was the highlight for you?\"\n\n Lily grins, her eyes lighting up. \"Cuddle Creations,\" she says without hesitation. \"Those plushies were... so cute. I would've bought the whole store if I had the money. But Mom already gets mad at me for having too many plushies, so I don't think she'd be happy.\"\n\n \"I definitely wouldn't,\" Mom says, voice drifting from the front seat.\n\n You laugh, bumping her lightly with your shoulder. \"Anything other standouts?\"\n\n Lily thinks a little longer before answering, \"Kaito!\" She smiles. \"The life-size cutout was so—so cool. We're getting married soon, you know. Plus I got his figurine.\"\n\n \"You and your Kaito,\" you tease. \"That was funny.\"\n\n She leans toward you and whispers conspiratorially, \"He has that... calm-powerful vibe or whatever. It's like he knows he's awesome.\"\n\n Mom chimes in from the front seat, her voice soft but amused. \"You two looked really happy today. I'm so glad it was fun. We should do this more often.\"\n\n \"Maybe,\" Lily snorts. \"Only if you're not too tired of my Kaito talk.\"\n\n \"You're fine,\" you reassure. \"Besides, I kind of want to try the arcade sometime.\"\n\n She perks up. \"Oh! You should. I'll show you my super top-secret claw machine technique.\"\n\n You elbow her, laughing. \"Deal.\"\n\n \"Sounds like a plan,\" Mom reaffirms, laughing.\n\n The rest of the ride is that easy back-and-forth that you've missed. As you observe the streetlights, you feel something settle behind your ribs—like you've found your footing again. Mom pulls into the garage and cuts the engine.\n\n \"Alright,\" Mom says, turning with a grin. \"Ready to call it a night?\"\n\n Lily grins. \"Best day ever.\"\n\n You meet your Mom's eyes in the front and nod. \"Yeah. Thanks, Mom.\"\n\n \n The drive home is silent—no radio, no commentary, just the hum of the tires on the asphalt and the soft click of passing streetlights. In the front seat, your mom navigates the turns, her face thoughtful in the glow of the dashboard lights. You're in the back, half-turned away from Lily, trying not to let your gaze linger, as if distance could fix the tension.\n\n Lily is curled into her seat, hands folded in her lap. She stares out the window, eyes unfocused, tracing the fleeting glow of streetlights. Every now and then, her foot taps against the floor, a small, restless beat.\n\n Your mom glances at the rearview mirror. There's a hope behind her eyes—hope for a conversation, a reunion, anything that might fill the space between you two. She inhales gently.\n\n \"[name], honey...\" she begins, voice soft and carrying so much care. \"What happened back there?\"\n\n You clamp your jaw. No answer, just another shift in your seat—stubborn and unhelpful.\n\n Mom looks at Lily now. \"Sweetie? You okay?\" she asks. But Lily's head remains turned, an image of silence, of walls carefully built.\n\n Your heart pounds. You don't want to hurt her more—and yet you remain quiet. You know each moment of silence sharpens the ache between you.\n\n Your mom sighs, almost a whisper. \"We don't have to talk about it now, but I'd like to understand... eventually.\"\n\n You stare at the seat in the front, words stuck on the tip of your tongue. Lily chews her lip, kneading the fabric of her skirt with her fingers. She bites back something she wants to say.\n\n Mom glances between both of you one more time. \"I just hate seeing you two like this. You've always meant so much to each other.\"\n \n No response. Not now. Not tonight.\n\n Your mom settles back in silence, turning back to the road. The drive stretches on, the distance between you three bigger than it should be.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

She rubs at her eyes. \"I am so tired,\" she mumbles, half to herself. She reaches for her phone and starts tapping away. \"Gotta update the group chat... tell them I'm still alive.\"\n\n She stands then, stretching. \"Night!\" Without waiting, she grabs her bag, shuffles past the pile of purchases, and heads toward the stairs. A few seconds later, you hear the familiar thud of her door closing.\n\n Mom turns from gathering up crumpled receipts, smiling at you. Her eyes are full of pride and affection. \"Today was so good, [name].\" She sets a bag down carefully on the coffee table and steps forward. Leaning into you, she wraps her arms around your shoulders in a hug that feels safe and right. \"Thank you—for letting me share this day with you and Lily.\"\n\n You relax into her embrace and return it gently. \"It was fun, Mom. I'm glad we did this.\"\n\n She squeezes you once before releasing, brushing a hand down your arm. \"I love you,\" she says simply, her voice thick with warmth.\n\n You nod.\n\n \"Okay, sleepyhead. Go get some rest,\" she says, stepping back. \"We'll see what tomorrow brings.\"\n\n You meet her gaze and smile. \"Goodnight, Mom.\"\n\n Grabbing your bags, you move toward the staircase. Each step is deliberate, echoing lightly in the quiet house. On the landing, you pause for a moment, hand resting on the railing, replaying the day's laughter.\n\n Your door awaits, familiar and comforting. You reach for the handle—cool metal under your palm—and turn it.\n\n \n You arrive home in silence, the driveway under the car tires almost too loud. You all step out, the garage door squeaking like an awkward reminder of the tension hanging between you. Lily moves first—turning sharply toward the front door, her backpack slung over one shoulder. She swings it open and pounds up the stairs. The door slams shut behind her with the finality of a verdict.\n\n Your mom exhales slowly and meets your gaze. She wraps her arms around herself as you stand there, the echo of Lily's departure still hanging in the air. Your heart tightens—seeing Mom like this makes you realize how much this hurts her, too.\n\n She takes a careful step closer, voice soft but steady. \"[name]... I know you don't want to talk about it right now. And I might not know exactly what happened today, but I do know this: I'm here for you—always. And I love both you and Lily, no matter what.\" She places a gentle hand on your arm, giving it a small, reassuring squeeze. \"I hope you two can work this out. I really do.\"\n\n You nod silently, emotions lurching in your chest, unspoken sorrow mingling with gratitude. You want to say something, but words tangle and won't come.\n\n Mom steps back, offering a small, encouraging smile. Then she gives you a look full of patient hope—like she's waiting, but understands it'l take time.\n\n You take a breath but say nothing, returning her smile with something quieter, unsteady but ready.\n\n \"Goodnight,\" she whispers, turning away to head to her room.\n\n You remain, feeling the weight of the evening settle. Then you turn, grab your bags, take a step toward the stairs, and start climbing. Each step raises memories—some warm, some sharp—and you wonder how they all fit together now.\n\n At the top, you pause before your door. The handle is cool under your hand. You wrap your fingers around the doorknob and breathe in.\n\n Then push it open.\n \n\n[Choice: Back home]",

Anime pop-up first. Then Cuddle Creations. Then Blink + Shine. Then food court. Then we go to that store that sells the strawberry-shaped hats I showed you—yes, I'm getting one, don't even try to stop me.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Lily, how are you already this excited when we haven't even entered the mall yet?\"\n\n\"Excitement is a transcendent experience,\" she replies, striking a silly pose.\n\nYou shake your head, smiling despite yourself, and fall into step beside her as the three of you make your way toward the mall entrance. The doors slide open with a soft whoosh, letting out a burst of cool, artificially scented air. Inside, the buzz of shoppers and background music mixes into a steady hum, familiar despite being a little overwhelming.\n\nLily immediately kicks into high gear again. \"Okay, now that we're actually inside, I have updates. Threadz has a sale where everything is only ten dollars. I don't even like that store, but just saying, it'd be irresponsible not to check it out. Also, I heard the sticker kiosk has Halloween sheets, and I need the ghost cats. Oh, and I'm making both of you try one of those milk teas with the weird little jelly stars in them. No escape.\"\n\nYou open your mouth to respond, but your mom gently places a hand on your arm. She's still smiling, but there's a softness in her eyes that makes you pause.\n\nThere's a small inhale—the kind she does before saying something that's going to be a little difficult. \"Hey, before we run off,\" she says gently, looking between you and Lily, \"[name] and I need to make a quick stop first.\"\n\nLily pauses mid-step, eyebrows raised. \"Uh-oh.\"\n\nYour mom smiles lightly. \"It's nothing bad. Just... something we've been putting off, and I think it's time.\" She turns toward you, her voice soft. \"I thought we could go and get you fitted for a bra. Nothing flashy. Just something basic and comfortable to help support you.\"\n\nYou blink. It's not a total surprise, sure. But hearing her say it out loud, here in the middle of the mall, still sends a weird wave through your stomach.\n\n\"I don't have a specific store,\" she adds, noticing your hesitation. \"We'll pick a place that looks calm and quiet. If it feels off, we leave right away. But I thought... maybe it was time.\"\n\nLily shifts beside you, glancing at you with slightly widened eyes. She doesn't say anything—yet.\n\n<<if [acceptance] > 19>> \n You exhale slowly. There's a strange flutter in your chest—part nerves, part something you can't name—but it's not dread.\n\n You nod. \"Yeah. Okay. I've been kinda wondering when we'd do that, anyway.\"\n\n Your mom smiles, clearly relieved. \"I didn't want to push, but I am glad. Just something simple. No pressure.\"\n\n \"I'm not expecting lace and rhinestones or anything,\" you mutter, trying to keep it light.\n\n Lily blinks, then recovers fast. \"Okay but, like, if they do have rhinestones, I'm going to be offended on your behalf if you don't try one.\"\n\n You snort. \"You're definitely not coming.\"\n\n \"Wait, actually—\" she steps forward a little, her tone quieter now, almost hesitant. \"Can I come too? I mean... not to be annoying or anything. I just thought it might be less weird if I'm there? I promise I won't say anything dumb. I'll be cool. Swear.\"\n\n \n You stop walking, your sneakers scuffing against the pavement.\n\n \"Wait. We're doing what now?\"\n\n Your mom turns fully toward you, gentle but steady. \"Only if you want to, sweetie. But I do think it might help. Just one well-fitting thing can make things easier.\"\n\n You don't want to make a scene. But part of you wants to run.\n\n Your mom doesn't rush you. \"It's just a fitting. We don't have to buy anything, and we can walk out any time.\"\n\n You nod slowly, reluctantly. \"Yeah. Fine. Just... can we make it quick?\"\n\n \"Of course,\" she says gently. \"No pressure. We got at your pace.\"\n\n Then Lily, who's been quiet, clears her throat. \"Hey. Could I come too?\" Her voice is unusually careful. \"Not to bug you or, like, make it weird. I just... thought maybe it'd be less awful with me there. But only if you're cool with it. I swear I won't tease you or anything.\"\n \n\n[Choice: Let Lily tag along]\n[Choice: No Lily today]",

None of the usual sarcasm or smirking, just Lily standing there, not quite meeting your eyes but still waiting, still asking to be included. Not because she thinks it'll particularly be fun, but because she wants to show up for you.\n\n You nod. \"Yeah... okay. You can come.\"\n\n Her head snaps up just slightly, and for a second she almost looks surprised—then she shrugs, all casual, like she hadn't just been bracing herself for a no.\n\n \"Cool. I mean... yeah. I figured you'd say yes,\" she says, like it's no big deal. But her voice is a little too light, and there's a tiny smile tugging at the corner of her mouth that she doesn't bother hiding. \"After all, who wouldn't want me tagging along?\"\n\n Your mom raises an eyebrow at her. \"You sure you'll behave?\"\n\n \"Mom, I always behave,\" Lily replies, already stepping closer to you. \"Besides, who else is gonna stop [name] from panic-buying some neon pink disaster?\"\n\n \"Hey,\" you mutter, smirking. \"You're speaking as if you wouldn't dare me to wear that.\"\n\n \"I would,\" Lily says. \"But only ironically.\"\n\n Your mom shakes her head, but she's smiling now too. \"Alright then. Let's go.\"\n\n The three of you fall into step, heading down toward the bra store. Lily's arms swing just a little as she walks beside you, like she's trying not to look too proud of herself. But you can tell that she is. Not proud of herself, but proud to be with you. And even though your stomach still twists with nerves about what's ahead, the weight of it feels just a little lighter with her there.\n\n \n \n You look at Lily, really look at her. You can tell she's not joking now. Her voice is soft, her eyes searching your face like she's trying to figure out the right thing to say without making it worse. She wants to come—not to mock or tease, but to just be there. To show up for you, even if she doesn't quite know how.\n\n But still... the thought of her seeing you in that space, vulnerable and uncertain, makes you feel uncomfortable. You can't do it. Not with her there.\n\n \"I... think I need to do this one on my own,\" you say quietly.\n\n There's a pause.\n\n \"Oh.\" She blinks, and you catch the flicker of hurt in her eyes before she lowers her gaze. \"Yeah. No, totally. I figured.\"\n\n Her voice is too light, too quick. She scratches the back of her neck. \"I'll just... I don't know. Hang out.\"\n\n Your mom starts to speak, but Lily cuts in before she can make it worse. \"It's fine, Mom. I'll just go to the arcade or whatever. Pick me up when you're done.\"\n\n She turns before you can say anything else, walking away fast. Her shoulders are a little hunched, her head down—not dramatic, not angry—just quiet. Dismissed.\n\n You feel it settle in your stomach like a rock.\n\n Your mom places a hand gently on your back. \"We'll be quick,\" she reassures. \"She'll be alright.\"\n\n You nod, but you don't dare look back.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

The mannequins in the display window are posed like they're mid-conversation, dressed in delicate bralettes and soft lounge sets, framed by curtains and fake flower petals. The lighting inside is warm and inviting, it makes the whole place feel like a secret.\n\n You feel your steps start to slow, like your feet suddenly remembered they have the power to stall. Your stomach tightens. There's nothing loud or scary about the store, and yet it frightens you.\n\n Your mom notices right away. She slows beside you, giving your arm a light squeeze. \"Hey,\" she says gently, her voice low enough that only you and Lily can hear it. \"Before we go in, how do you want me to introduce you?\"\n\n You glance at her.\n\n She gives you a small smile. \"I just want to be respectful. The staff might offer help, or ask what you're looking for. Should I say you're a girl shopping for a bra? Or a guy who just happens to need one?\"\n\n The words hang in the air. Your heartbeat quickens. The idea of being referred to in either way feels huge—like whatever answer you choose becomes real in a way it hasn't been until now. A kind of declaration, you suppose.\n\n Lily, who had been a few steps ahead, stops short. She turns to you, her hands tucked into the sleeves of her hoodie. You expect a joke or some kind of deflection, but it doesn't come. She's quiet for a moment, her expression more serious than usual—eyes flicking between you and the store.\n\n \"You should just pick the one that feels right,\" Lily finally says, her voice wobbling just a bit, like she's not totally sure how to phrase what she's trying to say. \"I mean, like... not what's gonna make it less weird for other people. Just... whatever makes you feel normal. Or whatever. Even if it's not, like, technically normal.\"\n\n She shifts her weight, eyes flicking down to the tiled floor. \"I don't really get all of it, but... I guess I don't have to, right?\"\n\n There's an awkward pause, like she wants to say more but her brain's still trying to catch up to her mouth. Then, softer, almost like she didn't mean for it to be heard: \"You always kind of did your own thing anyway.\"\n\n You glance at her. She's messing with the drawstring on her hoodie now.\n\n \"Like, remember when you made me wear those light-up sneakers to school in first grade? You said they'd make me run as fast as a superhero, and that that was proven by science. I tripped in front of the playground and got a grass stain on my face. But when no one wanted to sit with me at lunch, you left your fifth-grade table to sit with me anyway—even though I was crying and had fruit snacks melted in my hair.\"\n\n You blink, caught off guard. Both by the memory and by the fact that she remembers it.\n\n \"I dunno,\" she mumbles, her face scrunching up a little. It's as if she's annoyed with herself for being sentimental. \"I just think it's still you, no matter what you wanna go by. Just say what feels right and I'll back you up. I mean... someone has to keep you from buying something with, like, sparkly unicorns or whatever.\"\n\n You snort, and her smirk grows. Your mom glances between you both, patient and quiet, waiting. You look at the glowing store sign again. The mannequins don't seem quite as intimidating now. And neither does the choice.\n\n \n As you and your mom near the store, the bright pink sign comes into view. There are sleek mannequins posed in window displays, lace and soft cotton, and the faint smell of perfume. You slow your steps just slightly, feet dragging in that unconscious way your body does when your brain's bracing for something unfamiliar.\n\n Your mom notices. She glances at you, then slows too.\n\n \"Hey,\" she says quietly. \"Before we go in, how do you want me to introduce you? The staff might offer help or ask what you're looking for.\"\n\n You look up at her.\n\n \"Do you want me to say you're a girl shopping for a bra? Or tell them you're a guy who needs one?\"\n\n The moment hangs there between you, suspended in the soft mall lighting. Your pulse quickens and your mouth feels dry, because either choice means being seen in a way you haven't been before.\n \n\n[Choice: Say you're a girl]\n[Choice: Say you're a guy]",

      "text": "<<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You hesitate, the words catching for a second on the edge of your tongue. But when they come out, they feel strange in the best way—like something you've never really let yourself say in full.\n\n \"...Just say I'm a girl.\"\n\n Your voice is quiet, but steady. It surprises even you.\n\n Your mom gives you a warm, patient nod. \"Alright. I will.\"\n\n \n Lily's eyebrows flick up slightly. \"Cool. Makes sense.\" Then she flashes a crooked grin and adds, \"I mean, you already stole my hair tie.\"\n \n \n Lily's eyebrows flick up slightly. \"Cool. Makes sense.\"\n \n\n Your lips tug upward before you can stop them. There's this... weird flutter in your chest that you can't quite explain. It's not nerves or fear, but rather something lighter. Like something that was coiled tight in you just loosened a bit without asking permission.\n\n Lily bumps her shoulder lightly into yours. \"You're making a weird face,\" she whispers. \"Stop smiling or people are gonna think you like hanging out with me.\"\n\n You try to wipe the grin off your face, but it keeps coming back.\n\n Your mom gives your hand a gentle squeeze. \"Let's go, sweetie.\"\n\n Warm light and soft music drift toward you as you step in the store. For once, you don't feel like you're walking into something you have to brace yourself for. You're just walking forward.\n \n \n You glance at the glowing store sign, then quickly away again.\n\n There's a pressure building in your chest—tight, invisible, but there. Like the thought of being seen in a certain way is scarier than the actual fitting. You don't feel like a girl. You just feel trapped.\n\n You swallow and say, \"Whatever, just say I'm a girl.\"\n\n Your mom's eyebrows lift slightly, like she's making sure she heard you right, but she nods without question. \"Okay.\"\n\n Lily doesn't say much either. \"Yeah, that'll probably make it easier,\" she says shrugging.\n\n That's what this is all about, really. Making it easier. You don't want the store attendant to look at you funny. You don't want someone whispering behind the counter. You don't want to be asked questions you don't know how to answer. Saying you're a girl makes the whole thing faster, cleaner, less loud.\n\n But as you stare at the mannequins in the window, you feel a strange hollowness settle in your stomach. Not sadness. Not relief. Just... something missing. Like you gave the right answer, but not your answer.\n\n Lily nudges you lightly. \"You okay?\"\n\n You nod. \"Yeah. Just wanna get this over with.\"\n\n Your mom squeezes your shoulder. \"We'll be in and out. You're doing great.\"\n\n You don't feel like you are. But you walk toward the doors anyway. The light spills over you as they slide open, and you step into the store—wearing someone else's identity, just for now.\n \n \n \n \n \n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You take a breath and square your shoulders. The knot in your chest doesn't vanish, but it does settle—like a decision has finally clicked into place.\n\n \"I'm a guy,\" you say. \"A guy who needs a bra.\"\n\n Your mom nods, no hesitation or judgment in her face. \"Alright. That's what I'll tell them.\"\n\n You glance at Lily, expecting her usual teasing smirk, but she just gives you a small shrug—like this isn't weird at all. \"Honestly, that sounds kind of cool,\" she says. \"Guy walks into a bra store like, 'yeah, I need support.' Legendary.\"\n\n You huff out a laugh despite yourself. The nerves are still there, but the moment feels less like a spotlight and more like a warm lamp, shared between the three of you. For now, for today, you're just walking into this as you are.\n\n Your mom gently taps your back. \"Ready?\"\n\n You nod.\n\n The three of you step toward the entrance, the warm scent of fabric softener and soft music spilling out from behind the pink-lit glass doors.\n \n \n You shift your weight from foot to foot, throat dry. The question hangs in the air like it's pressing in on you.\n\n You stare at the store, then at Lily, and finally at your mom. Finally, you mutter, \"Just... tell them I'm a guy who needs a bra.\"\n\n Your mom nods gently. \"Of course.\"\n\n She doesn't say more. She doesn't need to.\n\n \"That's chill,\" Lily says after a pause. \"I mean, who cares, right? It's not like they're going to kick you out. A sale's a sale.\"\n\n You nod, but it's mechanical. It doesn't feel chill. It doesn't feel like anything you want.\n\n You hate that this is something you have to do. That your body keeps shifting on you, like it's in on a joke no one told you. Everything feels murky—like standing waist-deep in a lake you didn't mean to walk into, too far to turn around yet too cold to pretend you're not shivering.\n\n Your mom touches your arm. \"We'll go in, check sizes, and leave. That's it.\"\n\n You nod again. It's all you can manage.\n\n Lily doesn't say anything else, but she walks a little closer as the three of you step forward. You don't know if it's on purpose. You don't even know if it matters.\n\n The pink glow of the store washes over you as the doors draw near, the scent of soft cotton and perfume curling into the air like a reminder: you're going in—whether you like it or not.\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You hesitate for only a second, shifting your weight from one foot to the other, heart thudding with a nervous rhythm that feels... weirdly good.\n\n The store is just ahead and it should feel terrifying. A month ago, maybe even a week ago, it would've been.\n\n But now?\n\n Now your skin's buzzing with anticipation.\n\n \"I mean...\" you shrug, feigning disinterest. Your smile is creeping in anyway, tugging at the corners of your mouth before you can stop it. \"Just say I'm a girl. Easier that way.\"\n\n You glance at your mom—just briefly—and catch her watching you with the tiniest spark in her eyes. She knows. She sees the flush creeping up your neck and the way you twiddle your fingers. She doesn't say anything, opting to just give you a smile.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says. \"Let's get you fitted then.\"\n\n You swallow the grin threatening to spill over and nod like it's nothing.\n\n Your fingers twitch at your sides as you follow her, stepping into the softly lit store that feels less like enemy territory and more like something else.\n\n Your cheeks are warm. Your heart is loud. But you don't look back.\n \n \n You shift your weight, eyes fixed on the floor just past your mom's shoes. Your throat feels tight, like there's something stuck halfway up it. Words, maybe, or pressure.\n\n You don't want to be here. Not really. Not in this store. Not in this body that keeps changing no matter how hard you try to pretend it's not. The bra part? Fine. You'll deal with it. But the idea of saying you're a guy who needs one—of hearing someone else respond to that—makes your stomach twist.\n\n You let out a breath, eyes still down.\n\n \"...Just say I'm a girl,\" you mutter.\n\n Your mom doesn't react right away, but it's clear she's not buying it.\n\n \"Okay,\" she says finally. \"If that's what you want.\"\n\n You nod, but the motion feels hollow. You don't want it, exactly. It's just easier. Something to put between you and the awkward stares or the confused looks or the polite questions with too much kindness behind them. You're not here to make a statement.\n\n \"Let's just get in and out,\" you add.\n\n Your mom gives a soft hum of understanding, and the two of you move forward again, stepping toward the open glass doors and the soft hum of pop music playing just inside. You don't look up as you cross the threshold, pretending this is just another store. Another task.\n\n But it's not.\n \n \n \n \n \n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You stand outside of the store, the soft glow of its display lights casting across the tile. Your mom's voice still seems to linger in the air. The question she asked sinks into your chest. You glance down at your hands, fingers fidgeting with the hem of your sleeve, then up at the storefront again. Lace and cotton and soft colors. Everything you're not supposed to want.\n\n But you do. Or at least... you think you do.\n\n You've stopped pretending the changes don't matter. The way your reflection sometimes feels like it's catching up to something you've never said out loud.\n\n You bite the inside of your cheek, then look at your mom.\n\n \"Tell them the truth, I guess,\" you say. \"I'm a guy. A guy who just... happens to need a bra.\"\n\n She doesn't blink, flinch or question.\n\n \"Got it,\" she says, nodding.\n\n You stand a little straighter.\n\n It still feels scary—walking into a space not really built for you. But it also feels honest. You're taking a step toward something that's been waiting for you.\n\n The two of you cross the threshold together, the soft scent of perfume filling your nose.\n\n This is it.\n \n \n You stare at the floor tiles past your feet, your shoulders tensing under your top. The question lingers in the air like a held breath. You feel the heat rise in your neck, not from embarrassment, exactly, but from something murkier—resentment, maybe. The way your body's been shifting lately hasn't been subtle, and ignoring it stopped working a while ago. But saying it out loud still feels like rubbing salt on the wound.\n\n You take a breath through your nose and let it out slowly.\n\n \"Just tell them the truth,\" you mutter. \"I'm a guy.\"\n\n Your mom nods.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says. \"That's what I'll do.\"\n\n You appreciate that she doesn't make it into a moment. No hand on your shoulder or reaffirming words, just a quiet respect. That's exactly what you need right now.\n\n The two of you approach the storefront together. You swallow, straighten your back, and step through the entrance.\n \n \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "The air shifts the moment the three of you step into the store. It's warmer inside than the mall corridor, tinged with floral perfume and a soft trace of vanilla that seems baked into the walls. The lighting is low and warm, the kind that makes everything look softer, slower. Even the way the displays are arranged feels intentional—gentle and careful, like the whole place is trying to wrap you in a quiet hug.\n\n Lace and cotton bralettes line the walls in neat pastel rows, some folded, some hung. A few mannequins stand nearby in coordinated sets, posed like they know exactly what they're doing here. You instinctively shift a little closer to your mom, who places two calm, steady hands on your shoulders. The silent gesture tells you she's here, she's got you, and that alone helps more than you'd ever admit.\n\n Lily walks just a step ahead of you, scanning the displays like she already knows the layout—and, of course, she does.\n\n \"Oh, they moved the clearance rack,\" she mutters under her breath, half to herself, half to you. \"It used to be near the back. They had this ridiculous cactus print bra I made my friend buy. It had, like, glittery spines.\"\n\n Despite everything, your mouth twitches.\n\n She glances back, notices your look, and shrugs. \"What? I have taste.\"\n\n Before you can say anything, a store associate spots you from behind the counter and walks over. She looks like she's in her late twenties, with sleek hair pulled into a low bun and a name tag that reads Riley. Her smile is calm and practiced, but not fake—like she actually means it.\n\n \"Hi there,\" she says warmly, tone polite but genuinely friendly. \"Can I help you find anything today?\"\n\n \n Your mom steps forward just slightly, her tone light and easy. \"Yeah, actually. We're looking to do a fitting today as my child hasn't had a proper one yet.\"\n\n Riley's gaze flicks between the three of you, and she naturally lands on Lily. Her smile brightens. \"Of course! We can help you find something comfortable. First fittings are always a little tricky, but we'll make it easy.\"\n\n Lily blinks. \"Oh—uh—\" she starts, but your mom gently steps in with a soft chuckle.\n\n \"Oh, not her,\" she says, gesturing toward you. \"My older daughter.\"\n\n Riley's expression falters for only half a second—just the briefest flicker of recalibration—but then it smooths out as quickly as it came. Her voice stays calm and professional.\n\n \"Got it,\" she says with an easy nod. \"No problem at all. We'll take good care of you.\"\n\n The tight knot in your stomach loosens, just a little. You hadn't realized you'd tensed up until now.\n \n \n Your mom steps forward with a calm, even tone, like she's asking about socks and not getting her son a bra.\n\n \"This is my son,\" she says, with a little nod toward you. \"He's looking to get fitted for a bra. First time, and... well, we figured it was time to stop guessing.\"\n\n Something in your chest coils tight. For just a second, you brace—waiting for a flicker in Riley's expression. A raised brow. A confused smile. Something.\n\n But it never comes.\n\n Riley just nods, like this happens every other week here. \"Got it,\" she says, smooth and steady. \"We can definitely help with that.\"\n\n No weird looks. No hesitation. No moment. Just a warm, practiced smile and a kind of professionalism that makes it clear that you're not out of place here.\n\n You let out a breath you didn't realize you were holding.\n\n Next to you, Lily crosses her arms and mutters just loud enough for you to hear, \"See? Chill store.\"\n\n You don't answer, but your shoulder brushes hers.\n \n\n Riley gestures toward a hallway in the back, where soft lighting glows above a neat row of fitting room doors. It's quieter back there, tucked away behind racks of folded bralettes and hanging cotton sets in muted tones. The air smells of linen and warm perfume.\n\n \"If you'd like, we can do a fitting back here,\" she says gently. \"It's just some measurements, and there's no pressure to buy anything if you're not ready. We'll find something comfortable and supportive. You can follow me whenever you're ready.\"\n\n She gives you a reassuring nod before turning and walking a few steps ahead, giving you space to decide.\n\n Your eyes flick to your mom, who stands just behind you, one hand resting lightly on the strap of her purse. She's watching you with that soft, waiting expression she wears when she doesn't want to sway your choice—but wants you to know she's there.\n\n Then you glance at Lily. She's lingering off to the side, pretending to study a display of limited-edition bras shaped like clouds, but she's definitely eavesdropping. When she catches you looking, she just raises one eyebrow, as if to ask if you're good.\n\n You don't know if you are.\n\n The hallway suddenly feels longer than it is. The room behind that curtain feels a million miles away. Your thoughts spin with something heavy.\n\n Do you want your mom to come with you—be that steady voice when you're not sure what to say? Or should you go alone and prove that you can handle this yourself?\n\n Lily doesn't say anything, but her gaze lingers. Quiet. Waiting.\n\n \n The air immediately shifts as you step into the store. It's tinged with floral perfume and faint traces of vanilla. The lighting is warm, almost cozy, and everything about the space feels deliberately gentle—like even the design is trying to put you at ease.\n\n Lacy displays line the front, pastel bras folded and hung in precise rows. A few mannequins stand off to the side wearing matching sets like they know exactly what they're doing here. You shift a little closer to your mom, who places a reassuring hand between your shoulder blades, steering you further in with a calmness that helps more than you'd admit.\n\n A store associate—probably late twenties, with sleek hair in a low bun and a name tag that says Riley—spots you from behind the counter and walks over with a practiced smile.\n\n \"Hi there,\" she says, her tone friendly and professional. \"Can I help you find anything today?\"\n\n \n Your mom steps forward just slightly, keeping her voice light. \"Yeah, actually. This is my daughter and she hasn't had a proper fitting yet. I figured it was time, I don't know how we hadn't already gotten around to it.\"\n\n You feel your stomach tighten for a second, but Riley just nods with a smile that doesn't flicker.\n\n \"Of course,\" she says, like it's the most normal thing in the world. \"We can absolutely help with that.\"\n \n \n Your mom steps forward, her voice steady and casual. \"This is my son and he's looking to get fitted for a bra. First time, and... well, we figured it was time to stop guessing.\"\n\n For a half-second, something tightens in your chest. You brace for a reaction, some kind of flicker in Riley's expression—a double take, confusion, anything.\n\n But she doesn't even blink.\n\n \"Got it,\" she says smoothly, her smile just as warm and unfazed. \"We can definitely help with that.\"\n\n No weird looks. No awkward pause. Just acceptance, like this is exactly as normal as it should be. You let out a sigh of relief.\n \n\n She gestures toward a hallway in the back, where the fitting rooms are.\n\n \"If you'd like, we can do a fitting back here,\" Riley says. \"It's simple—just measurements, no pressure to buy anything if you're not ready. We'll find something comfortable and supportive. You can follow me when you're ready.\"\n \n\n[Choice: Ask your mom to come with you]\n[Choice: Go in alone]\n \n [Choice: Ask both of them to come with you]",

      "text": "You look ahead at the softly lit hallway leading to the fitting room, your heart picking up pace again. The idea of walking back there alone—stepping behind that door, stripping off layers while someone measures your body—makes your chest feel tight in a way that has nothing to do with fabric.\n\n You glance at your Mom, then Lily beside her. She's moved on from pretending to be really interested in the bras shaped like clouds to the bras shaped like cupcakes. Her eyes keep flicking back to you though, like she's trying to give you space and still be there at the same time.\n\n You voice comes out quieter than you mean it to. \"Mom, can you... come with me?\"\n\n Your mom meets your gaze right away, and her expression softens. \"Of course,\" she says, no hesitation.\n\n Lily looks up too, then quickly looks away again. \"I'll stay out here,\" she mumbles, trying to sound casual. \"Not like I'm dying to hear about your cup size or anything. But I'll be here just in case.\"\n\n You follow Riley through the hallway, past racks of soft bralettes and lounge sets. She stops in front of a small room with a plush bench, mirror, and a tiny hook on the wall. \"I'll step out and grab a measuring tape,\" she says. \"Just take your time getting ready.\"\n\n She closes the door behind her with a soft click, and you and your mom are left in the small, warmly lit space. She gives you room—just enough—but she's there.\n\n \n \n You tug your top off slowly, already dreading the part where you'll have to explain. The binder is snug against your skin, a gift from Coach Blake. It compresses well enough, but you've had it for a while now, and your ribs have definitely noticed.\n\n Your mom watches you carefully. She doesn't comment at first, which you're grateful for.\n\n After a moment, she says softly, \"Is that... comfortable?\"\n\n You don't look at her as you shrug. \"Not really, but it does work.\"\n\n She nods, not pushing. \"While I am proud of you for being honest, let's find something that doesn't hurt. Something that supports you, not just flattens.\"\n\n You keep your eyes on the mirror, jaw tight. The binder has been armor for so long, you almost forgot it wasn't supposed to hurt.\n \n \n You take a deep breath and pull off your top, revealing the folded towel you've wrapped around your chest—looped and knotted under your shirt like the improvised, desperate solution it is. It's tight. Too tight. Your ribs ache from it. You didn't want to wear it, but your other options didn't feel safe either.\n\n Your mom's expression flickers—just for a second—but she hides it quickly behind calm concern.\n\n She steps a little closer, voice low. \"Sweetheart... how long have you been doing that?\"\n\n You grimace, adjusting the knot. \"For a while now. I didn't want anyone to notice.\"\n\n Her hand hovers, then gently rests on your shoulder. \"Okay. First, we are not doing this anymore. You don't have to. We'll find something that fits. Something real. And you don't ever have to hurt yourself just to feel safe, okay?\"\n\n You nod. She doesn't press.\n\n A pressure in your chest lifts, figuratively and literally.\n \n \n \n \n You pull off your top and glance at the mirror. For a second, you almost expect to see something different something more—but your chest is still flat. Completely. No curves, no weight, nothing to hide or support.\n\n Your mom peeks over and gives a small, thoughtful nod. \"Still flat, huh?\"\n\n You shrug. \"Yeah. Nothing's really changed there.\"\n\n \"That's okay,\" your mom says, smiling gently. \"Still good to have something.\"\n\n You nod.\n \n \n You peel off your top, tugging it over your head, and adjust the hem of your plain sports bra underneath. It's one you got as a gift, and it doesn't really flatten or support much.\n\n Your mom glances over and gives a soft, approving nod. \"That's not a bad one. Has it been comfortable?\"\n\n You shrug, adjusting the strap on your shoulder. \"Mostly.\"\n\n She smiles. \"Well, we'll find something better. Something that doesn't just squish everything down.\"\n \n \n You slowly pull your top over your head, heart beating faster than it should as you feel your skin meet the air. No binder. No bra. Just you, completely exposed in front of your mom.\n\n Your chest has changed. You've known that for a while now. The shape, the weight, the way shirts fit lately—it's been slowly becoming something you can't ignore.\n\n Your mom watches you with that same gentleness. \"Thanks for letting me come in with you,\" she says quietly, like she knows you're fighting through a wave of complicated feelings.\n\n You nod once, arms automatically crossing over your chest. \"I just... didn't want to explain anything to a stranger.\"\n\n \"You don't have to,\" she says. \"We're just here to find what feels right.\"\n\n You slowly uncross your arms. You're not ready, but you are trying.\n \n \n\n There's a gentle knock at the fitting room door.\n\n \"Hey, it's Riley,\" comes her calm voice. \"Ready for me to come in for the fitting?\"\n\n You swallow, barely managing a quiet, \"Yeah.\"\n\n Riley steps into the fitting room with practiced ease, a measuring tape in her hands. She glances at both you and your mom, then gestures lightly. \"We'll just do a quick measurement. No pressure to commit to anything—this is just to get a baseline so we can find what feels right, okay?\"\n\n You nod, heart fluttering slightly, even if you try not to show it. Your mom steps back to give you two space, and Riley gently motions for your arms to lift a little.\n\n \"Arms relaxed. Just let me guide the tape—should only take a few seconds.\"\n\n You breathe in quietly, and she gets to work.\n\n \n The moment the tape wraps around the fullest part of your chest, you feel your face flush. You know you've changed—your shirt's been fitting differently for ages—but having someone measure it makes it feel official. Like proof.\n\n Riley doesn't react at all, simply checking the tape, adjusting the band level beneath your chest, and recording the numbers like it's no different than measuring your shoe size.\n\n She steps back with a small smile. \"You're measuring at a 36B.\"\n\n You blink. You hadn't expected them to be that... solid.\n\n \"That puts you in the medium-support range,\" she explains. \"You've got enough natural shape that you'll probably feel best in lightly structured cups. We can do soft underwire, or go wireless with shaping seams. I'll grab a few styles with a smooth finish. Trust me, you'll definitely notice the difference in comfort.\"\n\n \"Yeah. Let's try,\" you say.\n\n Riley nods and excuses herself to grab a few starter styles, leaving you and your mom in the soft quiet of the fitting room.\n \n \n The measuring tape brushes across your chest and it's... undeniable now. There's something there. Not huge or obvious, but it's real. The soft curve of your chest presses just enough into the tape that you feel the shift in numbers as Riley gently notes them.\n\n She doesn't blink. Doesn't hesitate. Her movements are calm and routine.\n\n \"Okay,\" she says after a few seconds. \"You're measuring at a 34A.\"\n\n Your heart skips a beat. You expected the A, maybe, but didn't expect to hear it said out loud like that.\n\n \"That means you've got a light cup size, but enough to benefit from a bit of support,\" she continues, unfazed. \"We'll start with soft cup bras—ones that offer lift and shape without any stiffness. There's no bulk or weird padding, just something to make you feel secure.\"\n\n Your mom nods thoughtfully beside you. \"That sounds perfect.\"\n\n \"Okay,\" you say, nodding. \"Thanks.\"\n \n \n Riley places the tape snugly under your chest first, reading the band size with a quick flick of her eyes. Then she shifts it higher, across where the breast tissue would be, but there's nothing there. She finishes the measurement without hesitation, jotting something down on the corner of her notepad.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says with a smile, standing straight. \"You're measuring at a 32AA. That means you're in the ultra-light support category. Nothing with underwire unless you want it—some soft bralettes or compression-friendly options will probably feel best.\"\n\n You nod slowly.\n \n\n \n You glance toward the softly lit hallway. The idea of going back there alone, having your chest measured by a stranger—it's nerve-wracking, yeah. But not impossible. You can handle it. You've handled worse.\n\n \"I've got this,\" you murmur, more to yourself than anyone else.\n\n Your mom studies your face for a second, then gives a small, proud nod. \"Alright. I'll be right here if you need me.\"\n\n \"Same,\" Lily pipes up from beside her. \"I mean, I'm not gonna, like, cheer or anything. But I won't run off to buy the strawberry hat I really want.\"\n\n You give them a quick smile, then go down the hallway alone. The fitting rooms are warm and softly lit, with pale pink walls and a plush bench. As you step inside and close the door behind you, the quiet settles in.\n\n Now it's just you and the mirror.\n\n \n \n You pull your top off slowly, already feeling the pressure from the tight, black binder beneath it. It clings to your chest, compressing everything into place like armor. It's familiar, and you've been relying on it for a while now. It works for the most part.\n\n But standing under this soft lighting, in this space that's supposed to be about fit and comfort, the way the binder presses into your ribs, suddenly feeling too sharp. Too restrictive. You twist side to side, stretching a little, wincing as the fabric digs in.\n\n You catch your reflection in the mirror. The binder gives you shape, or rather, takes shape away. But it also takes ease with it.\n\n You don't hate it, but you're not sure if you want to keep wearing something that hurts to feel okay.\n \n \n You tug your hoodie over your head slowly, wincing as the rough knot of fabric digs into your ribs. The towel you've wrapped around your chest is tight—too tight—but it's the only thing you have.\n\n As you undo the makeshift binding, the pressure lifts suddenly, leaving behind a dull ache and a faint red mark.\n\n You look at yourself in the mirror and feel both exposed and strangely relieved. The towel was always a temporary solution. You knew that. It was never meant to last, it was just supposed to get you here.\n \n \n \n \n Your shirt comes off easily, the fabric light over your still-flat chest. There's no curve to hide. Your torso is smooth and angular, the way it's always been, even as everything else seems to keep shifting around you.\n\n You glance at your reflection, expecting to feel small. But you don't. Not quite.\n\n You don't need a bra for support, at least not yet. But you're here anyway, and it never hurts to get one just in case.\n \n \n You lift your top and tug it off in one smooth motion, revealing the snug band of your sports bra underneath. It's plain, and was a gift from someone who thought you'd need it. It does the job, pressing down just enough that you don't think about it too much during the day.\n\n You glance at the mirror and run your fingers under the band. It's not uncomfortable, but it's not great either. It's... functional. But you want comfortable.\n \n \n You pull your shirt over your head slowly, revealing your bare chest underneath. You don't have a bra, or a binder, or anything. Your breasts are soft and visible, a quiet presence that's been increasingly harder to ignore.\n\n You came here for a reason. To stop pretending this isn't happening and to be comfortable. Maybe it's time to stop pretending that real is something to be afraid of.\n \n \n \n There's a gentle knock at the fitting room door.\n\n \"Hey, it's Riley,\" comes her calm voice. \"Ready for me to come in for the fitting?\"\n\n You swallow, barely managing a quiet, \"Yeah.\"\n\n The door opens and Riley steps inside with a soft smile and a flexible measuring tape looped around her neck. She closes the door gently behind her, moving with a practiced confidence. It's clear she's done this a thousand times and isn't about to make it weird.\n\n \"No stress,\" she says lightly. \"It'll just be two quick measurements—should only take a second. Relax your arms for me?\"\n\n You nod and stand a little straighter, heart fluttering just beneath your skin.\n\n \n Riley starts with the band measurement—firm but gentle as she wraps the tape beneath your chest. Then she moves upward, looping it carefully around the fullest part of your chest.\n\n You feel the heat in your cheeks rise. There is definitely no hiding the size now.\n\n Riley finishes and pulls back with a nod.\n\n \"You're measuring at a 36B,\" she says. \"That means you'll probably want medium support—something with shaping, maybe a soft underwire. But there's no pressure to go structured unless you want it.\"\n\n You blink. \"B?\" you repeat in a whisper.\n\n \"Yep,\" she says, unfazed. \"That's totally normal. You don't have to hide anything, but you don't have to show anything either. Just choose what feels right to you.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you murmur. \"That... helps.\"\n \n \n Riley wraps the measuring tape beneath your chest first, the soft edge resting against your ribs. She calls out the band size, then moves it upward, gently looping it across the curve of your chest. There's just enough pressure to feel, not enough to squeeze.\n\n You can't help noticing how much more there is than there used to be.\n\n She just reads the number, pulls back, and smiles.\n\n \"You're a 34A,\" she says. \"Which means you've got some shape but you're still in the lighter support zone. I'll bring you soft cups, maybe one with some lining if you're curious about it.\"\n\n You nod, arms hovering awkwardly at your sides.\n\n \"You've got options here,\" she adds. \"You don't have to hide anything, but you don't have to show anything either. Just choose what feels right to you.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you murmur. \"That... helps.\"\n \n \n Riley steps in front of you and wraps the measuring tape around your ribcage, right beneath your chest. It settles there without any resistance—just skin and bone, no curve to measure. She calls out a quiet number under her breath before shifting the tape upward across the flattest part of your chest.\n \n \"Alright,\" she says, straightening. \"You're measuring around a 32AA. That puts you in a flat-fit or soft bralette category. Just something comfortable and light.\"\n\n You nod, exhaling slowly.\n \n\n \n You glance down the softly lit hallway again, that warm glow doing little to calm the twisting in your stomach. Your palms feel clammy, and your heart thuds faster even though you haven't taken a single step.\n\n You look at your mom—steady, calm, always waiting without pushing. Then you look at Lily, who's half-distractedly flipping through a display of wireless bras shaped like pastel donuts. She's not even pretending to be subtle about watching you out of the corner of her eye.\n\n You swallow hard.\n\n \"This might sound weird, but can you both come with me?\"\n\n There's a beat of silence. Your mom's expression softens instantly, but Lily's eyebrows shoot up like you just asked her to walk into a volcano.\n\n \"Wait, me?\" she asks, blinking. \"In there? With you? And, like, bras?\"\n\n You nod, a little embarrassed. \"Yeah. Just... I don't know. It'd help.\"\n\n Lily blinks again, stunned into silence for a second—an actual miracle.\n\n Then, slowly, her mouth pulls into a grin. \"Wow. You want me of all people to emotionally support you while you try on underwire. This is either the best day of my life or the weirdest.\"\n\n \"You coming or not?\" you ask, giving her a look.\n\n \"Oh, I'm coming,\" she says, grabbing her bag dramatically like she's suiting up for battle. \"If you pass out from sheer boob-related panic, I reserve the right to mock you. Only a little, though. I'm kind.\"\n\n Your mom lets out a breath of laughter, gently touching your back. \"Alright, you two. Let's go.\"\n\n Riley, still nearby, catches your little group as you approach the hallway. She looks only mildly surprised that there are now three of you heading toward the fitting rooms, but she handles it like a pro.\n\n \"Come on back,\" she says with a nod, gesturing toward one of the open rooms near the end. \"You can all go in—it's a roomy one. I'll grab a measuring tape and be back in just a minute. Take your time getting settled, and I promise we'll find something that feels good.\"\n\n The space is small but cozy—soft bench and mirror. A little warm, maybe, but not suffocating. Riley steps back toward the front of the store, her footsteps fading.\n\n \"I'll be right back,\" she calls. \"Don't stress, this part's easy.\"\n\n And just like that, you're alone in the fitting room with your mom and sister.\n\n Lily immediately takes up residence on the little bench and crosses her legs like she owns the place. \"So,\" she says. \"This is what sibling bonding looks like.\"\n\n \n \n You pull your top over your head slowly—half because the fabric clings awkwardly, half because you're already dreading the conversation that's about to follow.\n\n The binder beneath clings tighter. It's been your go-to for a while now, a worn but reliable gift from Coach Blake, handed off with a quiet nod and zero judgment whatsoever. It does its job—keep things flat, contained—but the longer you wear it, the more your ribs ache in the background, like a warning you're used to ignoring.\n\n Lily, sitting on the small bench, falls uncharacteristically quiet. You catch her eyes flicking up for half a second before darting back down to her sneakers. She doesn't say anything. Not yet.\n\n Your mom watches too, her expression unreadable for a moment. She folds her arms loosely, her gaze softening.\n\n \"Is that...\" she begins gently, choosing her words, \"comfortable?\"\n\n You don't meet her eyes. You don't know if you can. \"Not really,\" you admit. \"But it works.\"\n\n Lily shifts, letting out a quiet breath. \"You've been wearing that this whole time?\" she asks, glancing up again. \"Dude, no wonder you're so grumpy.\"\n\n You give her a look, but your lips twitch despite yourself.\n\n Your mom steps closer but doesn't touch you—just stands near you. \"I'm proud of you for being honest, [name],\" she says. \"But let's see if we can find something that helps without hurting. Something that supports you... not just hides you.\"\n\n You don't say anything at first. You're staring at your reflection instead—the binder's flat lines, the faint indent it's carved just under your ribs. It's been armor for so long that you almost forgot armor isn't supposed to leave bruises.\n\n Lily leans back on her hands, kicking her foot gently. \"If someone makes a binder that doesn't feel like a medieval torture device, you should totally get it.\"\n\n You hesitate for a moment, fingers hooked under the edge of the binder. It's second nature by now—the way it sticks a little, the way your breath shifts once it's gone. You glance at the mirror one last time, jaw tight, then pull it up and over your head in one motion.\n\n The relief is instant and uncomfortable all at once. Your ribs expand without resistance, your shoulders drop a fraction. But you do also feel exposed, and not just physically.\n\n You fold the binder and place it neatly on the bench beside Lily, who glances at it and then up at you. She doesn't say anything. You're not sure what she would even say.\n\n Your mom offers a soft smile from where she stands by the wall. \"We'll find something that feels better than that. I promise.\"\n\n You nod.\n \n \n You take a slow, bracing breath and tug your shirt over your head, the fabric catching slightly on the knot underneath. The towel you've wrapped around your chest unravels just a little with the motion, pulling tighter against your ribs before slipping slightly askew. It's rough, twisted, and too tight in all the wrong ways. You feel the sting of where it's been digging into your skin all day, the ache in your back, the tension beneath your sternum.\n\n It was the only thing that feels even remotely safe lately. A rushed, desperate fix when your options were between this, nothing, or confronting something you're still not sure you're ready to name.\n\n When the towel finally falls still against your skin, there's a heavy silence in the room.\n\n Lily lets out a low breath from where she's sitting. \"Okay, that looks... intense,\" she says, not mocking—just surprised. \"Have you seriously been walking around like that all day?\"\n\n You nod, eyes on the floor.\n\n Your mom doesn't say anything right away. But her face—her whole posture—shifts. There's a flicker in her eyes, something sharp and protective, and then she turns it back down into calm. She steps closer, voice low but firm.\n\n \"Sweetheart,\" she says gently, \"how long have you been doing that?\"\n\n You fidget with the knot, pretending it'll make it more comfortable. \"A while,\" you mutter. \"Didn't want people to notice. Or look. Or... whatever.\"\n\n Lily shifts again on the bench, her voice quieter now. \"You didn't have to do that alone, you know.\" She doesn't meet your eyes when she says it.\n\n You give her a weak shrug. \"I didn't really know what else to do.\"\n\n Your mom's hand hovers for a moment, then rests gently on your shoulder—warm and grounding. \"Okay,\" she says. \"Well, we're not doing this anymore. No more towels. No more hurting yourself just to feel like you can walk outside.\"\n\n You finally look up.\n\n \"We'll find something that works,\" she adds. \"Something that fits you. And until then, we figure it out together. Alright?\"\n\n Your throat tightens, but you nod. You don't trust your voice to work quite yet.\n\n Lily stands up from the bench like she's had enough of the silence. \"Good. Because that towel looks like something you wrestled out of the lost and found.\" She pauses, then adds. \"We'll find you something better. Like, something with actual stitching.\"\n\n You huff out a half-laugh, more breath than sound, but it helps. It lifts something off your chest—even if only a little.\n \n \n \n \n You pull your top over your head and glance toward the mirror. For a split second, some small, irrational part of you expects something different—something new or unfamiliar. But it's still you. Still flat. No real curve, no weight, nothing to lift or shape or press down. Just skin, smooth and unchanged.\n\n Your mom steps a little closer, eyes scanning gently. She gives a soft, thoughtful nod. \"Still flat, huh?\"\n\n You shrug, arms folded over your chest. \"Yeah. Nothing's really changed there.\"\n\n She smiles, warm and easy. \"That's okay. Still good to have something. You never know when your body decides to surprise you.\"\n\n You nod. \"Yeah. Good to be prepared.\"\n \n \n You peel off your top, tugging it slowly over your head. Beneath, your plain black sports bra clings awkwardly—not tight enough to flatten much, not structured enough to offer support. It doesn't really do as much as it should, but you wear it anyway because it's what you have.\n\n You adjust the hem where it's riding up slightly and shift the straps on your shoulders, the elastic already a little worn.\n\n Your mom watches from nearby, arms folded loosely. \"That one's not bad,\" she says softly. \"Has it been comfortable?\"\n\n You glance at the mirror, then down at yourself. \"Mostly,\" you say, adjusting the strap again.\n\n She nods, stepping closer, her voice gentle. \"We'll find something better. Something made for you. Not something you have to just settle with.\"\n\n You nod, unsure how to respond, and glance toward Lily.\n\n She's still perched on the bench, her arms wrapped around one knee, gaze soft as it flicks from you to the sports bra and back again.\n\n \"That looks uncomfortable,\" she says gently. \"Like, not terrible, but... not right either.\"\n\n You shrug. \"It's what I had.\"\n\n She nods slowly, chewing on the inside of her cheek like she's thinking hard before speaking. \"We'll find you something better. I mean, you shouldn't have to feel weird in your own clothes, right?\"\n\n There's no sarcasm in her tone. It's just Lily, being as sincere as a fourteen-year-old can manage without combusting.\n\n \"Thanks,\" you say.\n\n \"Also, do you, um... want me to look away or something?\" she adds quickly, glancing toward the wall. \"I don't mind.\"\n\n You shake your head. \"It's fine.\"\n\n You reach back and unclasp the bra—simple, practiced—and slip it off, folding it and setting it on the bench beside you. The air feels colder against your skin now, goosebumps rising instantly, but the silence in the room stays gentle. No one's rushing you. No one's staring.\n\n Your mom gives you a quiet nod, stepping back to give a little space.\n \n \n You slowly pull your top over your head, heart thudding faster than it should, the fabric catching slightly before sliding free. The air hits your skin immediately—cool, unfamiliar. No binder. No bra. Just you, bare-chested and exposed in the soft, quiet light of the fitting room.\n\n You've done this before—looked in the mirror, seen the changes—but it still hits differently in a room like this. Somewhere official. Somewhere where things might actually be named.\n\n Your chest isn't flat. Hasn't been for a while. You've felt it in the way shirts hug tighter, in the way your hoodie zips up funny now, in the glances you catch from other people—sometimes confused, sometimes not. You know they've grown. You've just avoided really looking until now.\n\n Your arms fold over your chest almost on instinct. Not from shame, exactly, but habit. Protection. Muscle memory.\n\n Your mom doesn't move toward you, doesn't say anything too quickly. She's standing just a few steps away, giving you room, eyes calm and steady. \"You don't have to explain anything,\" she says. \"We're just here to find something that feels okay.\"\n\n Lily sits quietly on the little bench, legs pulled up and crossed, her fingers twisting the strings of her hoodie into tight knots. \"I didn't know you weren't... wearing anything,\" she finally says, voice small. \"Like, under your shirt. That had to be kinda uncomfortable, right?\"\n\n You shrug. \"It was fine.\"\n\n She nods, chewing the inside of her cheek. \"Still. That's rough.\" There's a pause. \"You ever get, like... stared at?\"\n\n You don't answer right away.\n\n \"Sometimes,\" you admit finally.\n\n Lily frowns. \"That sucks.\"\n \n\n There's a soft knock on the fitting room door.\n\n \"Hey,\" comes Riley's voice from the other side, friendly and light. \"Is your little group in there all set?\"\n\n You swallow hard, throat tight. \"Yeah,\" you manage—just barely loud enough to be heard.\n\n There's a soft knock, then the door creaks open. Riley steps inside with a practiced grace, the flexible measuring tape looped casually around her neck like a stethoscope. She closes the door behind her with a quiet click, her smile gentle and professional—no big reactions or weird energy. Just calm confidence, like this is something she does every day. Because it is.\n\n You feel the air shift slightly with her entrance, but it's not uncomfortable. Just real.\n\n \"Hey again,\" Riley says, her voice soft but upbeat. \"No stress, okay? It'll be two quick measurements—just a few seconds. I promise there'll be nothing dramatic.\"\n\n You nod, your arms still hovering awkwardly by your sides.\n\n Riley steps a little closer, tilting her head. \"Relax your arms for me?\"\n\n You hesitate for a breath, then let your arms drop slowly. Your heart's still fluttering, thumping just under your skin like it wants to bolt. You're suddenly hyper-aware of your chest, even though no one in this room is reacting like it's anything strange.\n\n Your mom stands nearby, calm as ever, giving you just enough space to feel in control. Lily, still curled up on the bench, watches you with a quiet intensity. She doesn't say anything, but her hoodie sleeves are pulled halfway over her hands, and her knees are pulled up like she's trying not to fidget. She offers the tiniest nod when you glance her way—barely a movement, but it's there.\n\n You don't say anything back, but your spine straightens just a little.\n\n \"Perfect,\" Riley says, stepping forward and gently unlooping the tape from around her neck. \"I'll start with the band size—right under the chest, nice and easy.\"\n\n She's talking like it's just another Thursday. Like this is as ordinary as shoe shopping. And maybe for her, it is.\n\n You nod again, your breath coming just a little steadier.\n\n And slowly, quietly, you stand up straighter.\n\n \n Riley steps in smoothly, her hands sure and practiced. \"Alright,\" she says lightly, \"this is going to be right under your chest. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay?\"\n\n You nod, trying to keep your breath steady. Your arms hang awkwardly at your sides as she kneels slightly, bringing the soft measuring tape around you ribs. The plastic of it is cool against your skin, but her touch is careful. It's clear she's done this for a thousand nervous people before you.\n\n From the bench, Lily sits straighter, watching like she wants to say something but isn't sure if it'll help. She's biting the inside of her cheek, fidgeting with the strings of her hoodie again, her foot tapping a soft rhythm against the bench leg.\n\n Next, Riley rises and loops the tape a little higher—over the fullest part of your chest. The sensation of it makes your skin prickle, and you feel your face go warm. There's no binder, no sports bra, no towel. Just you, standing in the open with your chest being measured.\n\n And yet, somehow in this moment—with your mom quietly close and Lily silently watching—it doesn't feel as horrible as you thought it would be.\n\n Riley finishes with a gentle tug of the tape and straightens up, reading the numbers with ease. \"Alright,\" she says, matter-of-fact, \"you're measuring at a 36B.\"\n\n Your heart stumbles a bit. \"B?\" you echo, barely above a whisper, like you're not sure you heard right.\n\n \"Yep,\" she replies, not missing a beat. \"Based on that, I'd say medium support is your best bet—something with shaping, maybe a soft underwire. But there's no pressure to go structured unless that's what you want.\"\n\n You glance down for a second, as if the numbers might magically appear written across your chest. The letter B echoes around your head. It feels bigger than it should. Out of the corner of your eye, you catch Lily shift on the bench. She doesn't speak up right away, just tugs at the edge of her sleeve, watching you like she's trying to find the right words.\n\n Then, just barely audible, she mumbles under her breath, \"Can't believe my brother's boobs are already bigger than mine.\"\n\n Your head snaps toward her, brows raised, but she doesn't look up—just keeps her eyes fixed on the floor, like if she doesn't meet your gaze, it won't count as a real confession.\n\n Riley doesn't seem to hear it. She's busy tidying the measuring tape, totally unfazed.\n\n Your mom lets out a quiet breath, something like a stifled laugh. You're not sure if she caught the comment or just the look on your face.\n\n \"Just remember that this is about what makes you feel safe,\" Riley adds gently.\n\n The tension in your chest—tight and coiled since the moment you stepped in the room—eases a little.\n\n \"Alright then, I'll grab a few to try on. Be back in a sec,\" Riley says, before slipping out of the fitting room and closing the door gently behind her.\n\n You exhale, finally letting your shoulders fall. The quiet that follows isn't heavy or awkward—it's just... there.\n\n \"Thanks,\" you murmur into the space she left behind. You're not sure if you mean Riley, your mom, Lily, or all of them at once.\n \n \n Riley crouches just a little as she wraps the measuring tape around your ribcage, just beneath your chest. Her hands are steady, her voice calm as she notes the band size under her breath. The plastic edge of the tape feels a bit cold against your skin, but her movements are practiced—no hesitation, no awkwardness.\n\n Then she shifts upward, looping the tape around the fullest part of your chest. There's a soft tension as she pulls it snug—enough to feel the shape, not enough to squeeze. You stand still, arms slightly away from your sides, trying not to fidget. But it's impossible not to notice it now. The curve. The weight. There's more there than you're used to, and there's no pretending otherwise.\n\n You catch Lily glancing up from the bench. She quickly looks away, pretending to mess with the tag on her hoodie like she's suddenly fascinated by washing instructions. You don't say anything. Neither does she.\n\n Riley finishes the measurement with a light tug and steps back, offering a warm smile. \"You're a 34A,\" she says matter-of-factly. \"That means you've got some shape, but you're still in the light support zone. I'll bring a few soft cup options—nothing heavy-duty, but enough for comfort. Maybe one with a little lining, if you're curious.\"\n\n You nod, still trying to wrap your head around the letter. A. You knew something had changed, but hearing it said out loud feels different.\n\n \"You've got choices here,\" Riley continues. \"Huh. That's literally my size too.\"\n\n You blink and glance over at her. She doesn't look up, just pulls her sleeves down a little and mutters, \"Can't believe my older brother has caught up to me.\"\n\n She shrugs a bit like it's nothing, but still refuses to meet your eyes. You don't know whether to laugh or groan, but you can tell she doesn't mean to tease. She's just... surprised. Maybe a little impressed. Maybe a little unsure how to feel about it.\n\n Riley doesn't seem to have caught the comment. She gives you one last nod and says, \"Alright, I'll grab a few to try on. Be back in a sec,\" before slipping out of the fitting room and closing the door gently behind her.\n\n You exhale, finally letting your shoulders fall. The quiet that follows isn't heavy or awkward—it's just... there.\n\n \"Thanks,\" you murmur into the space she left behind. You're not sure if you mean Riley, your mom, Lily, or all of them at once.\n \n \n Riley steps in front of you, her expression as calm as ever, and begins looping the measuring tape around your ribcage. The tape presses gently against your skin just beneath your chest—there's no real resistance, nothing to shift or flatten. Just skin, bone, and breath. She notes a number quietly to herself, fingers moving with practiced ease.\n\n Then she shifts upward, the tape gliding lightly over the flattest part of your chest. It's a brief moment, but your pulse still flutters as her hands settle the tape into place. There's no hiding anything here—not that there's much to hide. And somehow, that makes it feel even more vulnerable.\n\n Riley stands and gives a small nod. \"Alright,\" she says easily, \"you're measuring around a 32AA. That puts you in the flat-fit or soft bralette range. No need for support, just something light and comfortable. I'll bring you a few options that won't feel bulky or get in the way.\"\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You exhale slowly and nod, disappointed.\n \n \n You exhale slowly and nod, relieved.\n \n\n There's a quiet pause before Lily, sitting on the bench, speaks under her breath. \"Okay... at least I've still got you beat.\"\n\n You glance over, confused for a second, before you catch the slight blush on her cheeks. She keeps her eyes fixed on the floor, like she's pretending she didn't say anything. But there's the faintest upward twitch to her mouth, like she's trying not to smile.\n\n She doesn't say it meanly. If anything, she sounds weirdly... reassured?\n\n Riley either doesn't hear or pretends not to. She's already turning toward the door. \"Alright, I'll grab a few to try on. Be back in a sec,\" before slipping out of the fitting room and closing the door gently behind her.\n\n You exhale, finally letting your shoulders fall. The quiet that follows isn't heavy or awkward—it's just... there.\n\n \"Thanks,\" you murmur into the space she left behind. You're not sure if you mean Riley, your mom, Lily, or all of them at once.\n \n \n \n\n[Choice: See your options]",

She hands you a neat little stack of bras, each on a padded hanger, her smile warm but never too much.\n\n\"I got three basics and one that's a little more fun, if you're up for it.\"\n\nYou nod, murmuring a quiet thank you as she vanishes down the hall again.\n\nYou hang the bras one by one on the hook. They sway slightly, catching the light.\n\nYou run your fingers over the first one—white, smooth, and soft. Simple. It feels like the safe option. The kind you could wear without thinking or announcing anything. Just... functional.\n\nNext is a lavender one. Something about the color makes your breath hitch slightly. It's soft too, but a little more delicate, a little more expressive. It feels like something someone picked for themselves, not just to hide in.\n\nThe third is black. Sleek. Minimalist. There's something about it that feels... grounded. Like it belongs to someone who already knows what they want, who they are. You don't know if that's you yet, but it tugs at something in your chest.\n\nAnd then there's the last one—lacy black, floral stitching curling across the cups. It has a certain elegance to it that makes you hesitate. It's bold, feminine, and pretty.\n\n \n Your mom stays quiet, giving you the space. Watching without pushing.\n\n \"I'll just get one,\" you say, mostly to yourself.\n\n She nods. \"Then make it count.\"\n\n \n \"I'll just get one,\" you say to yourself.\n\n \n Your mom stays quiet, giving you the space to think. Lily is still sitting on the bench, her chin resting on her knee, watching you with the kind of quiet curiosity that means she's really trying not to say the wrong thing.\n\n \"I'll just get one,\" you say softly, more to the room than to anyone in particular.\n\n Your mom nods, her voice gentle. \"Then make it count.\"\n\n Lily nods too, albeit more awkwardly. \"Yeah. Like, pick the one that feels the most... you.\"\n \n\nYour hand lingers between the lavender and the black for a moment longer before you take one down from the hook.\n\n[Choice: Get the basic white bra]\n[Choice: Get the basic black bra]\n[Choice: Get the basic lavender bra]\n[Choice: Get the lacy black bra]",

It's not overwhelmingly pink or frilly like you'd half-expected. Instead, the vibe is intentional. Stylish. Curated. The lighting is soft and diffused as well, bouncing off racks of lightweight jackets, breezy skirts, and wide-leg trousers.\n\nYour mom steps in behind you with a content sigh. \"This is kind of cute,\" she says, offering you a small smile as she brushes a hand along a blouse.\n\nLily glides around, a subtle curiosity on her face. She reaches out for a dainty hair clip, weighing it in her hand. \"This one isn't really my thing, but it's... not awful,\" she says offhand. She tests the clip and gives a nonchalant shrug. \"Never mind. It's kind of growing on me.\"\n\n\"Want me to pick something for you?\" you ask, glancing at her.\n\nShe quirks an eyebrow and smirks. \"Go on ahead. But I'm not putting it in my hair if I don't like it.\"\n\n\"That corner looks nice,\" your mom says, nodding toward the accessories wall. \"Should we check it out together?\"\n\nLily nods, tucking the clip into her pocket. \"Sure, I'm up for it. But not for too long, alright?\"\n\n\"Deal,\" your mom chuckles. \"Just a quick look.\"\n\nThe store feels soft and simple, full of possibility and choice. It's giving you space. And right now, you can take it.\n\n[Choice: Head toward the accessories]\n[Choice: Decide to leave the store]",

These are small choices, easy to put on or take off, nothing more.\n\n \"I'll check that section,\" you murmur, and your mom gives a small nod, falling into step behind you.\n\n Lily immediately moves with you, her usual confidence softened by genuine curiosity. \"I actually bought the exact same hairpins and ties from here a few months ago,\" she says, scanning the display. She lifts some hairpins and examines it closely. \"Red, lavender, white... yep, I've got all three somewhere in my drawer.\"\n\n You hold up a pastel barrette adorned with tiny pearls. \"Maybe you should branch out to these,\" you say, amused.\n\n \"Maybe I should,\" Lily says, shrugging modestly. \"They don't look half bad.\"\n\n Your mom watches the two of you with a quiet expression of pride, as if this moment is more meaningful than the whole store. She picks up the same set of hairpins. Holding one up to your hair, she squints at the reflection in the small mirror inset above the display rack. \"Huh,\" she says softly. \"I actually like the red. Though... I'd probably lose it somewhere by Monday.\"\n\n \"That just means you have to buy a ton of them,\" you laugh.\n\n She rolls her eyes, but smiles affectionately. \"I guess I'll have to.\"\n\n You smile faintly, then turn your attention to the little container of hair ties next to her. Four types sit coiled like soft spirals:\n\n <ul> \n <li>A plain elastic</li>\n <li>A simple ribbon</li>\n <li>A bunny ears ribbon</li>\n <li>A scrunchie</li>\n </ul> \n\n \n Lily reaches over and plucks a ribbon from the container, twirling it between her fingers.\n\n \"I'd have all four of these already,\" she says, loud enough for your mom to hear, \"if [name] over here didn't steal one.\"\n\n You glance up at her, deadpan. \"You literally gave it to me.\"\n\n \"I gave it to you because you didn't even know how the hell to tie your long hair,\" she shoots back.\n\n Your mom chuckles softly, pretending to be very invested in some enamel pins. \"Oh no, not hair tie drama.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but your smile gives you away. \"Thanks for saving me from certain hair disaster, I guess.\"\n\n \"You're welcome,\" Lily says, tossing you a smug look. \"I charge interest, though.\"\n \n \n Lily reaches over and plucks a ribbon from the container, twirling it between her fingers.\n\n \"I have all four of these,\" she says. \"Got the lavender set, they're all really cute.\"\n \n\n You pick up the lavender pin, running your thumb across its smooth curve. It's small, barely the size of a matchstick, but it gleams under the soft store lights. It's small and quiet, but still... there.\n\n Your mom watches you for a beat, then glances at the display again.\n\n \"No wrong answer,\" she murmurs.\n\n And for once, it really doesn't feel like there is one.\n \n [Choice: Try some accessories on]\n\n \n \n \n You linger near the front display for a few more moments, glancing at the delicate hair clips and dainty ribbons. Yeah—they look cute. And yeah—they even feel like they could be something. Still, with each passing second, your shoulders tighten. There's no tension—no one's watching you, the music's mellow, and neither your mom nor the staff are pressuring you. Yet standing there feels like being in a room built for someone who knows exactly who they are—and that someone isn't you, not today.\n\n You swallow and glance at your mom. Then you glance at Lily, who's leaning back against a rack and holding a clip she's chosen. She's frowning, brow furrowed, like she's trying to figure out what to do with it.\n\n Softly, you say, \"I think... I don't want to shop here. Not today.\"\n\n Mom looks up from the scarf she was thumbing through and immediately sets it back on the rack. \"Alright,\" she says.\n\n You're surprised at how quickly she matches your mood. She offers you a small, easy smile and adjusts the strap of her handbag. \"You don't have to explain it,\" she continues, stepping beside you. \"Not every place clicks for everyone. And that's okay.\"\n\n Lily's eyes flick to you and your mom. She shrugs and puts the hair clip away. \"Yeah, this place is, like... aggressively girly,\" she whispers. \"Kinda shocked you even walked in.\"\n\n You smirk, half-laughing. \"Honestly? Me too.\"\n\n Mom nods, reaching out to tap your arm. \"Some places look nice until you're actually in the middle of them.\"\n\n \"Stealth retreat?\" Lily asks, winking at you.\n\n \"Stealth retreat,\" you echo.\n\n You glance at the racks one last time, but your heart really isn't in it. Then you look toward the open walkway, bright and full of everything else. The three of you turn together and step back into the flow of the mall, where there are places or stores that do feel right.\n\n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

Maya's face lights up when she sees you approach—not just because you're buying something, but because you genuinely want to.\n\n \"Good pick,\" she says, voice warm and genuine. \"You are going to look amazing.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you reply, cheeks warming from the compliment.\n\n Your mom stands beside you, steady and supportive. When Maya places the bag in your hand, she leans in, speaking softly. \"Come back anytime, alright? We always get new pieces—and you wear this style really well.\"\n\n You nod, letting those words settle deep. \"I will.\"\n\n You step back into the mall's gentle hum, the bag swinging against your side. Today, those clothes don't feel like risk—just promise.\n\n Mom falls into step to your left, her gaze soft as she watches you. \"You look lighter,\" she says quietly, like she's testing the observation.\n\n \"I feel lighter,\" you tentatively respond.\n\n Lily appears on your right—leaning froward. \"Who thought you would pull it off? Not me. But you did. Good job.\"\n\n You can't help but reflexively smile.\n\n She adds, almost like she's afraid to sound mushy, \"Don't get a big head. If that thing gets any bigger, you'll get taken away for experimentation. But... yeah. Nice.\"\n\n \"See?\" Mom says, laughing kindly. \"I knew that was coming.\"\n\n You glance at them both, warmed. The world around you hasn't changed, but maybe you have. Just a little.\n\n \n You carry the folded clothes to the counter, their weight oddly foreign in your hands. Lily hangs back a few steps, sidestepping just enough to give you space—but her eyes don't leave yours. She's quiet, her usual chatter paused, as if she knows now isn't the time.\n\n Your mom stands close by as well, offering silence support without intrusion.\n\n Maya greets you with that same calm smile. She scans the clothes, folds each receipt with care, and slides the bag across the counter without a single question. No one comments on your choices. No one asks how it felt. Which, in its own quiet way, feels like the right kind of space—not too much, but not too little.\n\n \"Thanks for stopping in,\" Maya says softly.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you reply, your voice barely above a whisper. \"Thanks.\"\n\n You take the bag and head toward the door. The air outside the store feels sharper—brighter and stranger then when you stepped in. The clothes are still tucked into the paper bag, safe and waiting.\n\n Lily falls into step beside you, picking up pace to match your stride. \"Well, you did it,\" she says. \"Got some new clothes. No full-blown meltdown either.\"\n\n Her tone is teasing, like she's trying to lighten the mood, but there's a softness in her voice that betrays her true feelings. You glance at her, unsure of what to say, and she shrugs.\n\n Your mom walks behind you, arms loosely folded, watching with a gentle look that might say \"I get it, don't worry.\" She says nothing, but when you pause, she does too. You expect a question, but she doesn't ask.\n\n \"If you hate it tomorrow, I'll burn it for you,\" Lily offers. \"Just say the word.\"\n\n The offer makes you laugh softly, low in your chest. \"Thanks, Lils.\"\n\n You don't really know what the clothes mean. You don't know if it felt good or weird or somewhere in between. But you let yourself try, and for now, that's enough.\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

She reaches into the display and slips a matching pastel bunny ears ribbon hair tie onto your wrist. \"Here—matching set.\" You glance at her, heart warmed by the gesture.\n\nYour mom stands behind you, her smile soft and real with genuine pride. \"You thinking about keeping it?\" she asks, voice gentle.\n\nBefore you can answer, a soft voice floats in from the side—Maya, the sales associate. She leans against the counter, silver name tag catching the light. \"Just so you know—those hairpins are three for five, hair ties two dollars each. The lavender one's one of our top picks,\" she says, nodding toward the ribbon now on your wrist.\n\n\"That's it?\" your mom asks, raising an eyebrow. \"That's really reasonable.\"\n\nMaya grins. \"We like making the little things fun. Sometimes one small accessory can brighten your whole day.\"\n\nLily leans over, her elbows grazing yours. She glances at the mirror, then adds, \"She's not wrong. One clip has flipped my mood before.\"\n\nYou tighten your grip around the hairpin, feeling its cool touch. She offers an encouraging nod without a word.\n\n\"You don't have to buy anything, but if it makes you feel even a bit more like yourself, I think it's worth it,\" your mom says, squeezing your shoulder.\n\nMaya, sensing the moment, steps back with a knowing smile. \"Let me know if you want to try the black or pink hairties.\"\n\n\"Isn't lavender your favorite color?\" Lily grins and nudges your elbow. \"Low-key, it's unique. Kinda like you.\"\n\n\"All right,\" you say, laughing softly.\n\nLily leans in and whispers conspiratorially, \"I'm editing your vibe to make sure you don't wear anything embarrassing. Call it sibling styling.\"\n\nYour mom chuckles, watching the exchange with fond eyes. \"I like that. Sibling styling.\"\n\nYou tilt your head, examining yourself from the mirror to Lily to Mom.

Inside the dim fitting room, everything feels gentler—like someone paused the noise outside just for this moment.\n\n On the bench lies your selection: a clean white tank top, an oversized soft sweater, and a cute blue skirt. There are a few other pieces still on their hangers—they send a flutter of anticipation through your chest.\n\n You sit down, your hand lingering over the sweater, feeling its weight and texture. It hums with possibility. You begin changing deliberately—the tank top slides on easily, snug but soft. The sweater settles itself just right on your shoulders. You slip into the skirt, and something settles in your chest—a careful calm that feels... correct.\n\n You step toward the mirror and freeze for a moment. It's not unease—it's wonder. The reflection isn't someone else. It's you, clearer and more honest than ever. Like static faded, and a deeper melody emerged.\n\n You do a little spin, enough to let the skirt flutter around your legs, and laugh—light and surprised. Your hands smooth the front, then adjust the folds, then smooth again. Not from doubt, but because you like this feeling. So much that your breath warms and settles in your ribs.\n\n Beautiful.\n\n You realize the word fits you now.\n\n A soft knock on the wall outside surprises you.\n\n \"You've been in there for a while, [name],\" your mom's voice floats in through the door. \"Doing okay in there?\"\n\n You straighten up and glance at your reflection. Then you answer, quietly but firmly, \"Yeah. I'm... really good.\"\n\n There's a pause, and you imagine her smile on the other side.\n\n You hold this moment—a held breath, a small glow—before gently removing each piece. Folding them with care, you press the soft fabrics like pressed flowers, a silent thank-you. You step out, clothes in your arms.\n\n Outside the room, you find your mom waiting thoughtfully on a small bench. Lily's slouched beside her—arms crossed and a wide grin plastered on her face.\n\n Mom's eyes light up the moment she sees the clothes in your arms. \"How'd it go in there? Did it feel okay?\" she reaches out, her tone soft but hopeful.\n\n \"Yeah, spill,\" Lily demands. \"Was it weird? Or did you actually like it?\" Her tone is playful, but there's something eager under the teasing.\n\n You offer them a calm smile. \"It... felt right. Comfortable. And the skirt spun nice,\" you admit, voice steady.\n\n Lily perks up, shifting to examine the folded skirt and sweater in your arms. \"See? It's all about the spin.\"\n\n Your mom lets out a breath she didn't realize she was holding. \"I'm really proud of you, you know. Taking a chance on something different—that takes a lot of bravery.\"\n\n You fold your arms around the clothes and shrug, trying to stay casual. \"It surprised me. In a good way.\"\n\n \"Can't be more surprised than me right now,\" Lily teases, smirking. \"I never thought you of all people would bring me along to go skirt shopping.\"\n\n You smile—soft and full. Maybe this wasn't what you would've expected a month ago, but there's nothing you'd rather be doing right now.\n\n \n You push the fitting room door closed behind you—it clicks shut, cutting out Blink + Shine's gentle bubblegum pop. You know Lily and Mom wait just beyond the door. You can hear their voices and soft laughter. But here, under the harsh fitting-room lights, it's just you and the clothes.\n\n You glance down at what you're about to try on, resting neatly on the bench: a white tank top, an oversized sweater, a cute blue skirt—and a few other things that make your heart race. They should be safe and unthreatening. They're just pieces of fabric, after all. But as you pull on the tank top, you feel a familiar tension anchor in your chest—the question: Is this really you?\n\n You catch your reflection as the fabric settles on your shoulder, heart twisting slightly. The clothes fit—shoulder seams sit right, the cut flatters, the fabric flows. You're not hiding in them. But there's still distance between you and the person in the mirror.\n\n You stand straighter, arms folding across your chest like armor. Try your best to mimic confidence. Tilt your chin. Exhale. But every pose feels rehearsed. Distant. And inside, the question still churns: \"What am I even doing?\"\n\n You switch to another skirt. Tug it on, smooth the fabric over your waist and hips, step back. It looks... fine. But still wrong. Wrong enough to make your throat tighten.\n\n There's no panic, no disgust. Just a slow, hollow well of disappointment. You really wanted this to work—and you tried it. But that doesn't make it click.\n\n You strip the clothes off carefully, fold each one back just how they were, neat and patient on the bench. Then you slide into your familiar top. It doesn't feel incredible—it just feels right. Unremarkable, but you. That's enough.\n\n You pull open the door and step out.\n\n Your mom looks up from her phone with soft, patient eyes. She doesn't ask if it worked—she doesn't need to.\n\n Lily's sitting besides her, arms crossed and foot tapping. \"So? Fashion success or epic flop?\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"I... tried.\"\n\n Your mom offers an encouraging smile. \"How'd it feel?\"\n\n You take a breath, brushing a loose strand of hair out of your face. \"Honestly?\" you say, voice low. \"It didn't feel like me.\"\n\n \"I mean, trying it on didn't make you someone else,\" Lily pipes up. \"You tried it, saw what it was like, and didn't like it. That's fine.\"\n\n You meet her eyes, surprised by her words, and nod. \"Yeah, it's just... not the answer.\"\n\n It's honest, sure, but it still stings a little to say it.\n\n Mom steps forward and puts a gentle hand on your arm. \"That doesn't mean it was a waste, honey. It means you learned something important. And that's always worth something.\"\n\n Maya glances over from where she's rearranging a rack of scarves. Her eyes flick to the clothes in your hands, and for just a second, you think she's going to ask. But she doesn't. She just smiles, small and neutral. \"Everything fit okay?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, because technically it did.\n\n She nods. \"Cool. Let me know if you need help checking anything out.\"\n\n It felt strange, like none of you was in there. But maybe, just maybe, that doesn't mean you have to walk away empty-handed.\n \n\n[Choice: Time to purchase]",

      "text": "You step into Cuddle Creations, and the rest of the mall might as well not exist anymore.\n\nThe air changes immediately—warmer and softer, like walking into a memory of your childhood bedroom. The lighting is warm and glowy, bouncing off clouds and stars hand-painted on the ceiling in swirling pastel blues and purples. Shelves curve like waves around the store, packed to the brim with plushies: bears, bunnies, bees, dragons, dinosaurs, cats shaped like croissants, sharks with sneakers on, frogs wearing crowns. There's no real order—just magic.\n\nLily lets out a dramatic gasp.\n\n\"Oh my God,\" she whispers, running ahead of you, practically vibrating. \"Look at this guy—he's a goose in a hoodie. He's wearing tiny shoes! You guys. He has laces.\"\n\nYou watch as she picks up the goose and cradles it like she's just been handed a newborn. \"I'm naming him Dr. Quackles. No one talk to me. We have to bond.\"\n\nYour mom follows behind, eyes wide, letting her purse slip to one side as she reaches out to touch a squishy-looking pink octopus. \"This place is kind of amazing,\" she murmurs.\n\nYou nod. \"Yeah. it really is.\"\n\nLily's already moved on, Dr. Quackles lying abandoned on a shelf. \"There's a banana slug wearing a top hat. What is this place? How do they know me?\" She lifts it dramatically, spinning in place. \"We are not leaving until I touch every single animal in here.\"\n\nYour mom laughs and picks up a tiny axolotl plush that fits in the palm of her hand. She turns it over thoughtfully. \"Serious question,\" she says, glancing your way with a small smile. \"Do you still like these? I mean, you're eighteen now. Not that you can't—but...\"\n\nHer voice is gentle and it's clear she's just curious. It's a moment where she's trying to meet you where you are.\n\nYou reach for a soft, sleepy-looking bear plush, its arms slightly raised like it's offering a hug. You squeeze it just a little. \"Yeah,\" you admit. \"I still do. It's comforting. They don't need anything from you. They just exist. It's kind of... peaceful.\"\n\nYour mom's smile stretches, her shoulders softening. \"That makes sense,\" she says. \"You were always the one who didn't let go of things. Stuffed animals, your old drawings, even that rock collection in your drawer.\"\n\nLily pauses mid-hug of a round frog and snorts. \"Wait, you still have that rock collection?\"\n\n\"Don't out me in public,\" you mutter.\n\n\"I'm just saying,\" she says, grinning. \"I support you, but also, I can't believe you put googly eyes on one of those rocks.\"\n\nYour mom sets the axolotl back and picks up a long caterpillar plush with fuzzy antennae. She hugs it tight against her chest like she's testing something out. \"It's not a bad thing, you know,\" she says. \"Letting yourself like things. It's been nice, seeing you do that today.\"\n\nShe lowers her voice just slightly. \"It really does feel like I'm getting to know you all over again. And I like this version.\"\n\nSomething tugs in your chest, warm and fragile.\n\n\"Thanks, Mom,\" you say, meaning it.\n\nLily's off again, buried in a pile of round, bakery-themed plushies. \"Okay, real talk,\" she calls. \"There's a baguette with eyebrows and I need you to experience it with me.\"\n\nYou walk over to a lower display with plushies shaped like loaves of bread—soft crusts, sleepy embroidered faces, arms and legs poking out. Some are cinnamon rolls. Some are whole toast families.\n\nLily holds up a plush that looks like a very tired pretzel. \"He looks like he's been through something. I love him.\"\n\nYour mom catches up, clearly more amused than she expected to be. \"So, what's the plan?\" she asks. \"Are you looking for someone small for your desk, or are we going full emotional-support burrito?\"\n\n[Choice: Ask what plushie they think you'd be]\n[Choice: Ask your mom and Lily what plushies they would want]\n[Choice: Ask if they think it's weird that you still like this stuff]\n[Choice: Ask mom what plushie she had as a kid]",

Let me think.\"\n\n Your mom looks amused. \"This is a dangerous question to ask your little sister, [name],\" she says.\n\n \"No, no,\" Lily says, pointing dramatically. \"I'm taking this seriously. This is like... a spiritual decision.\"\n\n She spins in place, scanning the shelves like a judge on a cooking show, before grabbing a majestic-looking dragon plush off the top of a display. It's not scary—more rounded than fierce, with velvet wings, big eyes, and a cute face. It radiates quiet drama and surprising softness.\n\n \"This is you,\" Lily declares, holding it up dramatically. \"Main character energy. Protagonist energy. You're secretly powerful, but trying to play it chill. Like, if you ever went missing, the universe would rearrange itself to find you.\"\n\n \"That's... weirdly specific,\" you say, blinking. \"I thought you'd roast me or something.\"\n\n \"Well, Lily isn't wrong,\" your mom says, snorting softly. She gives she dragon plush an appraising glance. \"You've always had this way of sort of... collecting people. Not on purpose. It's just that people like being around you.\"\n\n Lily points at you again. \"Exactly! You'd be the plushie in the corner of the store that no one notices at first, but when someone finally picks you up, they get super attached and start bringing you everywhere.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow, not sure how to respond.\n\n Your mom shakes her head, chuckling. \"See? Dangerous question.\"\n\n \"Okay,\" you say, letting the idea settle in. \"Dragon plushie. Chosen one. I can live with that.\"\n\n \"You and dragon [name] were meant to be,\" Lily says, patting your shoulder with exaggerated solemnity.\n\n You don't say it out loud, but.... yeah. It actually feels kind of perfect.\n\n \n You walk slowly along the edge of a display shaped like a giant wooden crescent moon, its shelves lined with plushies stacked like sleepy stars. You trail your fingers across a narwhal with a glittery horn and a cinnamon roll that looks like it just woke up from a nap. Nothing's calling to you just yet. Instead, you glance back over your shoulder.\n\n Your mom stands a few paces behind, her purse slung loose at her side. She isn't pretending to scroll through her phone or trying to rush you along—just quietly watching, letting you go at your own pace.\n\n Lily is hunched in front of a lower shelf, squishing a lineup of bread-shaped plushies with an intensity that makes it seem like she's choosing a battle partner. \"These ones are all too soft,\" she mutters. \"I need structure. Support. Personality.\"\n\n You hold up a donut-shaped plush with tiny arms and a worried little smile stitched into its frosting. \"Hey, what about you two?\"\n\n Both of them glance up.\n \n \"Me?\" your mom asks, blinking.\n\n Lily perks up instantly. \"Wait, we're allowed to pick one too? Is this a full plushie adoption situation?\"\n\n \"If you had to pick one,\" you say, holding the donut out to your mom. \"What would you go for?\"\n\n She lets out a small laugh, surprised. \"You want me to get one?\"\n\n \"You're allowed to like soft things too,\" you say, nodding.\n\n Your mom steps forward and gently takes the donut plush, turning it over in her hands. \"This one looks like it's apologizing just for existing.\"\n\n \"Relatable,\" you say.\n\n She laughs and returns it to the shelf, wandering to the next row of plushies. Her fingers brush over a sleepy seal, a penguin in earmuffs, and a fluffy white cat with a bowtie. Eventually, she pauses at a slightly lopsided fox with a patch sewn over one ear and tiny beans stitched into its paws.\n\n She picks it up slowly, almost reverently. \"I like this one,\" she says softly. \"It's kind of ragged-looking. I like that.\"\n\n You watch her turn it in her hands. There's something familiar with the way she holds it. You can't help but wonder how many toys she held like this when you were little. How many nights she tucked a plushie back under your arm after you dropped it in your sleep.\n\n \"Would you actually keep it?\" you ask.\n\n She shrugs, giving the fox a small pat on the head. \"Why not? I don't need one. But I wouldn't mind having something small on my nightstand. Something a little dumb. Something soft.\"\n\n She looks over at you with a smile, her tone playful. \"You don't grow out of needing comfort, [name]. You just stop giving yourself permission to ask for it.\"\n\n The words settle around you like a blanket. You don't say anything at first. Honestly? You don't need to.\n\n Lily, meanwhile, is pacing dramatically between three different displays, arms overflowing with plush chaos.\n\n \"Okay, while you and Mom were speaking, I've narrowed it down to five,\" she declares, with the intensity of someone making an actual life-or-death decision. \"But none of them are perfect. This is like choosing a starter Pokoban.\"\n\n You watch her circle the nearest shelf again like she's trying to summon divine guidance. \"Alright,\" she says, holding up a frog. \"You're soft. You're green. But do you speak to my soul?\"\n\n She frowns and sets it aside.\n\n Next, she holds up a blobfish in a wizard hat. \"You're a vibe. But I feel like you'd judge my spelling. Next.\"\n\n She crouches, grabs a suspiciously swole duck with both hands, and squints at it. \"You terrify me. I respect that. But I can't bring that kind of energy home.\"\n\n She glances over at you like you're supposed to understand the gravity of what she's going through. \"[name], this is so unfair. They're all so specific. What if I pick one and the others feel abandoned? What if I spark a plushie war? I'll feel responsible.\"\n\n Your mom raises an eyebrow from her spot beside a shelf of sleepy cats. \"Pretty sure they'll forgive you.\"\n\n \"You don't know that!\" Lily shoots back, clutching a bread plush protectively for a second before tossing it into a random bin. \"That one gave me nothing emotionally. We're done.\"\n\n Finally, she spots it.\n\n On a shelf tucked halfway behind a display of themed unicorns and bubble tea plushies, there's a round little red panda. its fur is deep russet, its eyes wide and slightly off-center, and it's stubby paws are positioned like it's about to punch something and apologize right after. Lily goes quiet.\n\n She picks it up and stares at it like it just told her a secret.\n\n \"Oh no,\" she whispers.\n\n You peer over. \"Found your match?\"\n\n \"This one looks like it would throw hands with God for me,\" she says, very seriously. \"And then spiral about it all night.\"\n\n \"So... you,\" you say, snorting.\n\n \"Exactly,\" she says, clutching the red panda to her chest like it's already family. \"I have found my plushie soulmate. We are bonded now. I will never know peace again.\"\n\n Your mom chuckles. \"Glad we got that settled.\"\n\n Lily doesn't answer—she's too busy whispering something to the red panda, like they're already plotting something.\n\n You smile to yourself. Just like that, all three of you have found something small and soft in a world that's anything but.\n\n \n You pick up a soft, sleepy-faced monkey from one of the lower shelves and turn it over in your hands. You trace your thumb across the embroidered smile, then glance up at your mom and Lily.\n\n \"Hey,\" you say, voice a little quieter than before. \"Do you guys think it's... weird? That I still like this stuff?\"\n\n They both pause.\n\n Your mom straightens from where she's been examining a plushie the length of a loaf of bread. Her brows lift slightly. \"Weird?\" she echoes.\n\n Lily, who was mid-rant about whether a koala in overalls was cuter than a duck with a rain hat, blinks and falls silent. For once.\n\n You shrug, trying to play it off. \"I dunno. I'm eighteen. Most people are moving on from this stuff. I just... haven't.\"\n\n Your mom's expression softens. \"Sweetie, you've never been the kind of person who gives things up just because someone else decides you're too old. You still have the shoebox full of Yo-Ta-Ro! cards you stole from your cousin in fifth grade.\"\n\n \"Borrowed permanently,\" you correct, deadpan.\n\n Lily plops down beside you on a massive plushie shaped like a possum in a hoodie. \"Okay, but like, why wouldn't you still like this stuff? Look at them.\" She holds up a blobfish wearing a chef's hat. \"You think the existence of Chef Blobert is just for five-year-olds? No. Chef Blobert is eternal.\"\n\n You snort beside yourself.\n\n \"Besides, it's not like you're out here pushing a stroller full of plushies to class or whatever,\" Lily adds, shrugging a little. \"You're just... letting yourself like soft things. That's not weird. That's just human.\"\n\n Your mom kneels beside one of the lower bins and picks up a tiny lamb with a star-patterned bow. \"You know,\" she begins, gently brushing its ear, \"I think liking something harmless and gentle in a word that's this complicated is kind of brave. It means you're still listening to the part of yourself that knows what peace feels like.\"\n\n You glance back at the monkey in your hands. It doesn't seem embarrassed to be what it is. It just... exists. Hug-ready. Constant. Simple.\n\n Lily leans against your arm and stage-whispers, \"Also, if you don't pick something, I will, and I'll make you carry it around in public. His name will be Hugster McSqueaks and you'll be emotionally attached to him by this time next week.\"\n\n You laugh, but there's something steady and real underneath the teasing. You're not weird for liking this stuff.\n\n You're just you.\n\n \n You turn a plush bunny over in your hands, then glance toward your mom, who's examining a jellyfish with sparkly tentacles and the softest embroidered smile you've ever seen.\n\n \"Hey, Mom,\" you say. \"Did you have a favorite plushie as a kid?\"\n\n Your mom blinks, caught off guard by the question. Then a slow smile starts to creep in as she sets the jellyfish back on the shelf. \"Wow. That's... been a while,\" she says, brushing a bit of hair behind her ear. \"But yeah. I did.\"\n\n Lily immediately perks up from behind a pyramid of plush waffles. \"Oh, this I have to hear.\"\n\n Your mom chuckles, folding her arms lightly. \"Her name was—don't laugh—Miss Buttons. She was a faded pink teddy bear with a bow tie, and I think she had one actual button sewn where an eye used to be.\"\n\n \"Miss Buttons?\" you repeat, grinning.\n\n \"She was a very distinguished teddy bear, thank you,\" your mom says, feigning offense. \"She was classy, quiet, and extremely judgmental of anyone who sat on my bed without permission.\"\n\n Lily is absolutely cackling now. \"You had a haunted Victorian teddy bear.\"\n\n \"She was not haunted,\" Mom insists, holding back a laugh on her own. \"She just had presence.\"\n\n You laugh too, picturing it. \"What happened to her?\"\n\n \"Oh, I kept her for years,\" your mom says, the smile turning a little more thoughtful. \"She got a little floppy and threadbare, but I brought her to college. She sat on my shelf through every bad exam week and every weird roommate situation. I think I still have her somewhere in the garage.\"\n\n \"That's kind of awesome,\" you say.\n\n Your mom shrugs like it's no big deal, but there's something proud in the way she stands. \"She made me feel like myself. Even when everything else was messy.\"\n\n Lily raises her hands. \"Follow-up question. When can we go down to the garage and meet her?\"\n\n \"We'll see,\" Mom says with a mock seriousness. \"She's picky about visitors.\"\n\n You shake your head with a smile, and the three of you drift further into the store. It's strange how a silly question about plushies turns into something soft and real. Something that makes the air in your chest settle a little easier.\n\n Turns out everyone has a little softness they're carrying with them. Even if it's a pink bear with one eye and way too much personality.\n \n\n[Choice: Pick a plushie]",

      "text": "You wander a little deeper into the store, the air somehow growing even softer—like every step forward wraps you in a layer of cotton. The lighting feels gentler here, the music more of a hum than a sound, and the only real noise comes from the occasional rustle of tags or the squish of plush against plush.\n\nYour mom trails behind you, still smiling faintly, letting you take your time. She doesn't say anything, just watches you move from shelf to shelf like she's watching something quietly important.\n\nLily, on the other hand, is bouncing from bin to bin like a ferret in a sugar rush. She's doing that thing where she pretends not to care while absolutely caring more than anyone else.\n\nYou pause at a low shelf near the floor, and something immediately catches your eye.\n\nA goat plushie.\n\nIt's soft gray, with tiny twisted felt horns and tiny hooves that look like they were sewn with too much love. It's got a dumb, slightly lopsided grin, and its little tail sticks out like it's mid-hop.\n\nYou grin without thinking. \"This guy looks like it eats paper when you're not watching.\"\n\nYour mom leans over and snorts. \"It'd definitely chew through your math homework and then act personally offended when you call him out.\"\n\n\"That thing's got criminal energy,\" Lily declares, peeking over your shoulder. \"Like, it's got a fake ID and uses it to sneak into goat nightclubs.\"\n\n\"Goat nightclubs?\" you ask, deadpan.\n\n\"Yeah. That's where they play ska and eat cardboard,\" she replies, dead serious.\n\nYou shake your head, still smiling, and gently place the goat back.\n\nA few steps away, tucked into a little fabric basket like it's hiding on purpose, you find a meerkat plushie. It's long and lanky, with tiny beady eyes and paws tucked up like it's halfway through panicking about a quiz it didn't know it had. The little furrow in its brow makes it look like it's perpetually overthinking.\n\nYou run your thumb across its soft back. \"This one looks like it hasn't slept in three days and thinks it offended someone years ago.\"\n\n\"Reminds me of someone,\" your mom says, leaning closer.\n\nYou turn slowly to look at her. \"Rude,\" you say. \"Accurate, sure. But rude.\"\n\nLily pops into view again, squinting at the meerkat. \"My assessment is that that one looks like it narrates documentaries in its head just to feel less awkward at parties.\"\n\nThen, a few steps further on, you spot it—on a nearby table, nestled between two oversized sunflowers made of felt, there's a round, chubby little bee plushie. It's mostly fuzz, with tiny stubby wings that flop when you lift it, a soft yellow belly, and a stitched-on smile that radiates pure, slightly misguided optimism. The wings bounce a little when you shake it gently.\n\nYour mom hums. \"It looks like it'd be really good at giving pep talks and terrible at respecting personal space.\"\n\nYou pat its fuzzy head. It gives a satisfying boing.\n\n\"Come on,\" you say. \"It's trying its best.\"\n\nLily comes out of nowhere and crouches beside you. \"That thing would definitely yell encouragement at you during a test before accidentally knocking your pencil off the desk with its wing.\"\n\n \n You glance down at the trio in front of you—goat, meerkat, and bee—each of them their own tiny universe of charm and softness. You could see yourself walking out with any one of them.\n\n But your eyes drift.\n\n A few steps back, near the display of novelty lattes and oversized jelly plushies, Lily is kneeling beside a lower shelf, one arm still wrapped tight around her red panda. She's not bouncing or cracking jokes right now. Instead, she's looking at a line of birds, gently tapping each one on the head like she's saying goodbye.\n\n She notices you watching and straightens up quickly. \"What?\" she says, voice a little defensive.\n\n You lift an eyebrow.\n\n \"I'm just... checking if any of them are, like, secretly better,\" she mumbles, tightening her hold on the red panda. \"But they're not. This guy's it.\"\n\n She presses her cheek against it like she's trying not to make a big deal out of it. But she is. For all her fire and teasing, you can tell this plush means something. It's not just a silly animal—it's the one she picked when she was allowed to have something soft. Something hers.\n\n And a little farther away, closer to the checkout, you spot it.\n\n The ragged fox.\n\n The one your mom held earlier—quietly, almost like she hadn't realized she was doing it. Its patched ear, its worn little paws, the slight lean in its posture like it's been through things and came out softer instead of meaner.\n\n It's still there. Waiting on the same shelf. Slouched to the side like it never expected anyone to come back.\n\n Your mom notices your gaze and waves it off immediately. \"Oh, don't worry about that one,\" she says quickly. \"I just thought it was cute. I don't need one.\"\n\n She doesn't meet your eyes when she says it.\n\n And you remember—how she smiled when she picked it up. How she turned it in her hands like she wasn't just admiring it, but recognizing it. Something about that fox connected with her, even if she'd never admit it.\n\n Now you stand between three plushies of your own and two quiet wishes from people you love. You weren't supposed to buy one for anyone else. The plan was one plushie at most, only for you.\n\n But suddenly the choice feels bigger than it should.\n\n Because Lily might joke and deflect, but she holds that red panda like it makes her feel safe. And your mom—who's spent so long giving everything to everyone—looked at that old, patchy fox like it whispered something she hadn't heard in years.\n\n And here you are. Only one can come home. But which one... is up to you.\n\n \n You glance down at the trio now in front of you—goat, meerkat, and bee. Each one ridiculously different. Each one... kind of perfect.\n\n Too perfect.\n\n Because you're only getting one. That's the rule. Space. Budget. Logic. They all say one.\n\n But your heart? Your heart finds it hard to care about logic.\n \n\n \n<<if [money] > 19>> \n [Choice: Get the goat plushie]\n [Choice: Get the meerkat plushie]\n [Choice: Get the bee plushie]\n \n [Choice: Get the fox plushie for your mom]\n [Choice: Get the red panda plushie for your sister]\n \n \n[Choice: Decide against getting a plushie]",

      "text": "You stand there for a long moment, the weight of the decision settling heavier than expected. The plushies stare back at you—not literally, of course, but the way their little stitched eyes gleam under the soft lights, you feel them watching.\n\n Lily's voice cuts through the quiet. \"Okay, wait,\" she says, coming up beside you and squinting at your empty hands. \"You're seriously not getting any of them?\"\n\n You shrug, but it's not casual. Not even close.\n\n \"What?\" she repeats, louder this time. \"Seriously? You're just... leaving them here?\"\n\n Your mom hears the shift in her tone and glances over. She tilts her head slightly, watching you, trying to read your face.\n\n You don't answer right away. You just stand there, arms crossed tight like you're holding something in place.\n\n The goat stares up with its crooked grin, like it's still hoping you'll change your mind. The meerkat's tiny paws look frozen mid-reach. The bee... it doesn't even wobble anymore. Just sits there, round and soft and a little too still. All three of them waiting for you to do something.\n\n But you don't.\n\n You turn away instead.\n\n Lily looks between you and the shelf, her brow furrowed. \"Dude, come on. It's you. You're like... the #1 plushie fan. This is your whole thing!\"\n\n She tries to keep her voice light, teasing even—but there's a confused edge to it now. And under that, something disappointed she's not sure how to say out loud.\n\n Your mom approaches slowly, her purse still slung over her shoulder. She doesn't say anything at first—just glances down at your hands, still empty, then at your face. You can feel her trying to figure it out. You can feel both of them waiting for you to change your mind.\n\n But you don't.\n\n \"Changed your mind?\" your mom finally asks, softly.\n\n You nod once. \"Yeah.\"\n\n That's all you say. And then you walk toward the exit.\n\n The moment the door opens, the soft, warm air of the store is replaced by the chiller hum of the mall—brighter, louder, cooler. You don't look back, you wouldn't dare, but you can feel it.\n\n It's like you left something behind that might've been more important than it looked.\n\n Lily trails behind slower than usual, hugging her arms. \"That meerkat was kinda rooting for you,\" she mutters, almost too quiet to hear.\n\n And your mom walks silently beside you, not pushing.\n\n But you can feel the question they're not asking and the soft weight that isn't in your arms.\n\n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]\n\n \n \n \n You hold the goat plushie in your hands, its little lopsided smile still staring up at you like it knows exactly what it is and couldn't care less. Its soft gray body fits perfectly in the crook of your arm, like it's been carried around forever. The felt horns are slightly crooked, and one ear sticks out at a defiant angle.\n\n You squeeze it gently.\n\n It doesn't just feel right. It feels like you picked each other.\n\n Lily circles you like a tiny fashion consultant, eyeing the goat critically. \"Okay, but like... why is he staring at me like he knows all my secrets?\"\n\n You shrug, grinning. \"I guess he's seen things.\"\n\n She squints harder. \"He looks like the kind of goat who runs a sketchy magic shop in the woods and charges you three riddles and a wheel of cheese for a cursed sword. You get what I mean, right?\"\n\n \"Not really,\" you murmur.\n\n Your mom chuckles, arms folded. \"A goat, huh?\"\n\n \"He's got something going on,\" you say with a nod, gently squishing his horn. \"You can tell just by looking at him.\"\n\n \"All I'm saying is that he definitely has a fake name and an underground lair,\" Lily adds. \"I love him.\"\n\n You make your way to the counter, goat in tow, and are immediately greeted by a cheerful employee wearing glittery nail polish and a name tag that reads Jenn.\n\n \"Oh my God!\" Jenn exclaims, lighting up the moment she sees your choice. \"You picked Grumble Goat! That one's part of our limited run. We call him Grumble because he always looks like he's about to cancel a company meeting with zero notice.\"\n\n You glance down at the goat, who indeed looks like he'd file a formal complaint against your existence—and win.\n\n \"Yeah, that tracks,\" you laugh.\n\n Jenn scans the plushie's tag, then gestures toward a kiosk decked out in pastel buttons and softly glowing screens. \"Okay! Here comes the best part. Every plushie adoption comes with a certificate. You get to name him before we print it out.\"\n\n \"Like a real name name?\" you ask, staring at the screen.\n\n \"Oh yeah,\" Jenn nods. \"This is legal and binding. He's your responsibility now.\"\n\n \"He's gonna be such a handful,\" you mumble.\n\n Lily leans over the screen, poking the edge. \"Okay but please don't name him something boring like 'Jake.' He looks like he'd cast a spell on your cereal if you did that.\"\n\n Your mom raises an eyebrow behind you. \"Lily's right. You better not pick something you'll regret. He seems like the vengeful type.\"\n\n You stand at the kiosk, fingers hovering over the keyboard, glancing down at the goat still tucked in your arm. His smug little face stares back at you like he already knows what you're going to type—and is either extremely proud of extremely disappointed.\n\n Lily leans closer, whispering, \"Name him something epic. Like... Grandmaster Fluff.\"\n\n You snort, but the pressure's on. The screen glows softly and your fingers hover.\n\n Time to name the goat.\n\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n \n \n You hold the little meerkat plushie gently in your hands, its tiny paws curled close to its chest, its eyes wide with that familiar, soft anxiety. There's something about it that makes you want to keep it safe. You imagine it standing guard on your desk, nervously watching over your snacks and overthinking every decision you make. It's sweet. Loyal. Just a little nervous. The little guy seems like he's still not entirely convinced it deserves to be picked.\n\n Lily slides up beside you and peers at the plush in your arms. \"Oh my God,\" she says. \"It looks like it's stressed about having to call and make its own doctor's appointment.\"\n \n \"When have you ever done that?\" your mom murmurs under her breath.\n\n You snort. \"He definitely rehearses conversations in his head before ordering food.\"\n\n \"Who'd ever do that?\" she mutters, then pokes its tiny snout. \"But he's cute. In that nervous sort of way.\"\n\n Your mom leans in to get a look too. \"You two are right,\" she says, tapping the meerkat's nose. \"He's got a worried little face. Like he's deeply concerned about your laundry habits.\"\n\n \"Or my snack decisions,\" you add.\n\n \"I mean, being honest here, someone probably should be,\" Lily throws in, smirking.\n\n You're smiling now, and it's not just because they're being funny. There's something about the way this little guy looks like he never quite believes he belongs—that quiet, loyal energy that feels familiar in a way you're not ready to unpack.\n\n You carry him to the front counter, still cradles in your arms like he might bolt otherwise. Jenn, the cashier with sparkly nails and a glittery name tag, perks up immediately when she spots your choice.\n\n \"Ohhh, you picked a PeekPal!\" she beams. \"Excellent choice.\"\n\n \"A what now?\" you ask.\n\n She turns the plush gently and points to a small tag tucked near his leg: PeekPal Series — For The Quiet Kind of Brave.\n\n \"They're new,\" Jenn explains as she scans the barcode. \"Made for people who overthink literally everything, but somehow still show up. This one's part of our 'Cautious but Courageous' set.\"\n\n You glance down at the meerkat. Suddenly, his tiny stitched face seems even more sincere. Like he's just happy to be included, even if he doesn't quite know why.\n\n \"He looks like he needs a loyal human,\" Jenn adds with a wink. \"And snacks. Like, a concerning amount of snacks.\"\n\n Lily nods solemnly in agreement. \"You're gonna have to share chips with him. That's the law now.\"\n\n You hug the plushie a little closer, his fur soft under your fingertips. He's anxious. He's sweet. He's kind of exactly what you didn't know you were looking for.\n\n Jenn gestures to the kiosk, where a screen glows gently with pastel colors and a blinking cursor. \"Time to make it official. Give that little guy a name he can be proud of.\"\n\n You take a breath and approach the kiosk. The meerkat's eyes meet yours—stitched but somehow trusting.\n\n You cradle him close as the screen flashes: Name Your PeekPal\n\n Lily leans over your shoulder. \"He looks like he'd name himself something like Gerald and then immediately second-guess it.\"\n\n \"That's not off,\" your mom says, laughing. \"Whenever you're ready, [name].\"\n\n And you are.\n\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n \n \n The bee plushie's still right where you left it—propped up between two oversized sunflower made of fabric like it's trying its best to look important. Its fuzzy yellow belly is round, with stubby little black legs and soft felt wings that wobble slightly when you move it. It looks like it would absolutely volunteer for something and immediately panic about it.\n\n You reach for it without hesitation.\n\n There's something about this one. It's not the biggest, nor the softest, but it looks like it would sit next to you on your desk and remind you to drink water and breathe. Like it would give you a pep talk in a squeaky voice before an important exam, even if it was nervous too.\n\n Lily pops up behind you and lets out a soft gasp. \"Oh my God. He looks like he just got promoted at work and is pretending to know what spreadsheets are.\"\n\n You laugh, adjusting your grip on the plushie. \"Well, he's definitely faking it till he makes it.\"\n\n \"Until he crashes into a window, that is,\" she mutters, gently flicking one of the bee's wings.\n\n Your mom walks up just as you give the bee an experimental squish. It compresses perfectly—just the right mix of resistance and softness. Like a hug and a pep talk rolled into one.\n\n \"He's cute,\" your mom says, her voice warm. \"The kind of plush that'd sit on your desk and remind you to take your vitamins. I approve.\"\n\n You glance down at the bee in your hands. He really does look like he'd give you an awkward thumbs-up before a big test.\n \n \"Is this the one?\" she asks.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you nod. \"He's kind of perfect.\"\n\n At the front counter, Jenn—the cheerful employee with the glittery name tag—is instantly delighted when she sees what you're holding.\n\n \"Ooh, you picked a BuzzBuddy!\" she says, clapping once.\n\n You blink. \"That's... a thing?\"\n\n Jenn grins, her sparkly earrings bouncing as she nods. \"Absolutely. That little guy's part of our Support Squad Line. BuzzBuddies are known for showing up, panicking a little, and doing their best anyway.\"\n\n Lily snorts. \"Sounds familiar.\"\n\n You shoot her a look, but you're laughing too—because yeah. That checks out.\n\n Jenn carefully scans the tag, then waves you over to a kiosk nearby. \"Alright! Most important part of the adoption process—time to give him a name.\"\n\n The kiosk glows with soft yellow and white light, little sparkles twinkling behind a blinking text box. The screen reads: Name Your Buzzbuddy\n\n Lily leans over your shoulder. \"Please name him something dumb. Like Greg. Or Professor Honeybutt.\"\n\n Your mom raises an eyebrow. \"Let [name] choose something he likes,\" she says, though she's clearly amused.\n\n You look down at the bee. His stitched smile is unwavering—wide-eyed and buzzing with loyalty, like he's already ready to follow you into battle or help you reorganize your desk drawer.\n\n He's waiting.\n\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n \n \n Fox Plushie Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n You spot the ragged little fox still sitting where your mom left it, its patchy ear folded slightly forward, as if it's been eavesdropping this whole time. It hasn't moved an inch—just resting there with that crooked tail and the worn thread on its belly like it's been waiting quietly to be remembered.\n\n You glance back at your mom.\n\n She's across the aisle, gently testing the squish of a mushroom-shaped pillow, pretending to be entirely focused on the texture. But her eyes flick over, just for a second, to where that little fox still sits.\n\n She looks away again like it didn't mean anything. Like she hadn't been thinking about it since she set it down.\n\n Lily is squatting by a display of plush toast, her red panda cradled tight. She's flicked her attention from you to the fox when she notices your gaze lock on it again. \"Did you see the way Mom looked at that thing?\" she asks quietly, her voice softer than usual. \"It's like she's been thinking about it all morning.\"\n\n You nod, walking deliberately toward the fox. It feels overdue. You pick it up and notice how its fur is matted in places and how the stitching on its belly is uneven—but there's a warmth there, like it belongs in someone's hands again. As you cradle it, the store's background noise fades.\n\n Lily sets her red panda down, eyes still flicking between you and the fox. \"She really liked it, didn't she?\" she whispers.\n\n Your mom, meanwhile, is nearby, testing the fluff of a giant mushroom pillow. She notices Lily's glance and drops the pillow like it's hot. She steps toward you, her expression shifting the moment she sees you holding the fox.\n\n \"I wasn't... thinking of getting one,\" your mom blurts out as soon as she sees you approach, voice quick and dismissive. But you catch the way her eyes soften when she looks at the fox a little closer. She lowers her gaze, trying to look casual, but you see her heart leaning forward.\n\n You give her a gentle smile. \"I know. But you liked this one. And... I'd really like you to have him.\"\n\n Lily brightens beside you, sensing the meaning behind your gesture.\n\n Your mom angles her head like she's trying to think of the perfect excuse to refuse. \"Oh, but you don't need to—\" she starts, voice small. Then she clears her throat and perches on her tiptoes to adjust the fox, almost instinctively smoothing his patched ear. \"Really, though. He's... kind of sad-looking. You shouldn't have.\"\n\n \"Mom,\" you say. \"I'd really like to give him to you.\"\n\n There's a pause. Lily scratches the back of her head, shifting slightly. \"He... he does look like someone who'd be great to hug after a long day,\" she chips in, her voice soft but honest.\n\n Your mom's eyes flick to Lily, then back to the fox—you can almost see her heart pulling in two directions. She wraps her arm gently around the plush, holding him closer as if grounding herself. A faint tremor quivers in her hands.\n\n Finally, she exhales. \"Alright, I'll take him,\" she whispers, very soft. \"You're sweet, you know that?\" She brushes a hand over the fox's shabby fur.\n\n Lily grins like she just won something huge, her red panda momentarily forgotten. She skips forward and gives you a quick fist-bump. \"Mission accomplished,\" she whispers with triumphant energy.\n\n You approach the counter with the ragged fox nestled in your mom's arms. Lily still hugs her red panda close as though it's her co-pilot. Jenn, with glittery nails and a warm smile, greets you before catching sight of what's in your mom's arms.\n\n \"Aww,\" she murmurs, reaching out to brush a thumb over the fox's patched ear. \"You're taking this little guy home? He's been waiting a long time. You've got to name him.\"\n\n Your mom lifts the fox, cradling it gently, brushing its ear. Jenn steps aside to let you approach the kiosk, where a softly glowing touchscreen waits.\n\n Lily gives her red panda one last squeeze. \"Bye, dude,\" she mumbles. \"Don't get into too much trouble without me.\" She plants a kiss on the plush's head before placing it back on a random shelf.\n\n Jenn guides the three of you to the kiosk. \"Okay! Time for the fun part. Your fox needs a name, and we've got to customize his certificate.\"\n\n Your mom eases into place at the kiosk, the fox nestled securely in the crook of her arm. Her eyes soften as she glances at the glowing screen and then down at the brave little plush in her hands.\n\n You and Lily hover nearby, giving her space, but sharing that warm moment. Lily shifts her weight, hugging herself in excitement. \"Go, Mom,\" she whispers, a proud grin spreading across her face.\n \n Your mom's gaze drifts back to you, and her voice is soft, a little shaky with gratitude: \"Thank you for noticing.\"\n\n It's an understatement, but the meaning is undeniable. You nod, and she squeezes the fox as if to hold onto that warm feeling in the air.\n\n \"Okay,\" she breathes as her fingers hover over the glowing text field and keyboard.\n\n She takes a steadying breath, and begins to type.\n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n \n \n Red Panda Plushie Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n You stand in the soft glow of the plushie shop, cradling three contenders in your arms: the goat with its crooked grin, the ever-anxious meerkat, and the hopeful little bee. Each one is compelling in its own way.\n\n But as much as you like them, something deeper is whispering: this isn't about you today.\n\n Your eyes wander.\n\n A few shelves away sits the fox plushie your mom seemed to like. You smile a bit at the memory, but you don't reach for it.\n\n Then you spot Lily, standing by a rack of oversized plushies, still clutching her red panda like it's an anchor. She holds it close to her chest, chin pressed almost absent-mindedly against the fur, as she speaks to herself in a whisper: \"I need this... No, I already have plenty... but... maybe...\"\n\n Her voice trails off, and your chest lurches. Her struggle is obvious. The red panda matters more than any other plushie here. You remember her pacing earlier: the tiny drama of going from plush to plush until the eventual surrender to that one perfect plush.\n\n An instant decision settles in your veins: this is the one.\n\n You set the goat, the meerkat, and the bee gently on a nearby display, deciding the one plushie you'll get won't be for you. Not this time.\n\n You approach Lily, heart beating fast. \"Hey,\" you whisper. She looks up, startled. You nod toward the red panda in her arms. \"I want to buy him for you.\"\n\n Her eyes go wide—jaw literally slack. She stares, stunned. \"What? Seriously?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you reply, voice calm so her heart doesn't trip like yours is. \"You picked that one and you clearly do like him. You deserve it.\"\n\n Lily blinks. Once. Twice. Her defenses wobble—her usual teasing sparkle and fire give way to something like gratitude, but she's fumbling for words.\n\n Your mom, watching from the fox-shelf vantage, smiles softly. She knows this moment is big.\n\n Lily clears her throat. \"[name], you don't have to—\"\n\n You shake your head. \"No. I want to.\"\n\n Her fingers tremble slightly.\n\n \"I know it doesn't always seem like it, but you matter to me.\"\n\n \"Thank you...\" Lily says, voice small and shaky. She pauses, taking a deep breath, then resumes: \"I mean... I really love him. He's super soft. And cute. And he looks like... like he knows all my secrets. I appreciate you doing this.\"\n\n You make your way to the counter, and Lily sets him down like he's something precious—which, to be fair, he is.\n\n Jenn looks up, her glittery name tag catching the soft overhead light. When she sees what's in front of her, her entire face lights up. \"Ohhh, good choice!\" she coos. \"That one's one of our CozyCompanions. We only got a few in this season.\"\n\n Lily's eyes flick from Jenn to the plushie to you then back again. She's trying to act like it's no big deal, but her hands won't stop fidgeting with the hem of her hoodie.\n\n Jenn scans the tag and offers a warm smile. \"He's a crowd favorite. I think you all will take good care of him.\"\n\n You glance at Lily.\n\n She's hugging her arms now, her hair a little messy, cheeks pink and eyes a touch too shiny. She won't meet your gaze, but her voice is soft when she says, \"I... I'll do my best.\"\n\n Behind the two of you, Mom watches the exchange with a quiet smile, one hand resting on her purse strap like she's bracing against how much she wants to tear up. She doesn't say anything—just meets your eyes and nods once.\n\n Jenn gestures to the kiosk, where a softly glowing screen prompts Lily for a name.\n\n \"Whenever you're ready,\" Jenn says with a wink.\n\n Lily glances at you, holding the red panda close. She takes a breath. Then steps up to the screen.\n\n [Choice: Continue]",

You tap the screen—careful, considering—and finalize the name: [goatplushieName].\n\n The screen responds with a ding and a little burst of animated goat confetti that rains down in silly majesty. You can't help but grin—because it's adorably over-the-top, and it feels perfect.\n\n Jenn catches your smile. She announces it like a proud announcer: \"[goatplushieName]!\" Her voice is full of energy. \"Excellent choice. Very noble... and very mischievous.\"\n\n She taps a few more buttons and then turns the screen around to you so you and your goat can see it together:\n\n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, [goatplushieName]!\n\n A digital badge appears beneath it that says \"Certified Goofball.\"\n\n Your mom leans over, nudging Lily with a knowing smile. \"Certified Goofball. Doesn't that say it all?\"\n\n Lily grins back, eyes bright. \"Totally. He's gong to pull some crazy goat shenanigans.\"\n\n Next, Jenn leads you to a small pastel podium with a built-in printer. Soft whirring and cheery chimes follow, and a cream-colored certificate buzzes to life. When it slides out, Jenn holds it before you with both hands.\n\n You take it gently and read:\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that [goatplushieName], a Goat of Great Personality and Questionable Impulse Control, has been lovingly adopted by [name] on this day. May your hugs be strong, your snacks be shared, and your secrets be safe.\n\n Your chest warms and you laugh softly. It really does feel important.\n\n Lily peeks at the certificate, bursting with a bratty grin. \"A Goat of Great Personality and Questionable Impulse Control?! That's, like, 100% accurate.\"\n\n Your mom chuckles, brushing a hand over the certificate. \"He's perfect for you.\"\n\n Jenn gently wraps [goatplushieName] in a soft, protective tissue—not the rough kind, but the gentle, cushioned one that seems made for magical creatures. She places him in a sturdy white tote bag decorated with their emblem: a sleeping moon curled lovingly around a bear.\n\n \"Take good care of him,\" Jenn says, leaning in conspiratorially. \"He's one of our best troublemakers.\"\n\n Mom picks up the bag with a fond smile, her fingers brushing against the plush fur. \"He's in good hands.\"\n\n You carefully slide the certificate into the bag, making sure it won't get crumpled.\n\n As you step out of the store, your mom rests a hand on your shoulder. \"He seems like a handful,\" she says softly, but her warmth is tangible.\n\n You smile up at her, then look at Lily's enthusiastic bouncing. \"Yeah,\" you say. \"But he's mine.\"\n\n Lily adjusts the goat in the bag so his face peeks out, and adds, \"He's the best addition to the family.\"\n\n And walking away, the three of you carry that glow through the mall, that silly little plush goat tucked in close and brimming with promise.\n\n \n You take a steady breath and tap the screen. Your fingers hover for a moment before typing: [meerkatplushieName].\n\n Immediately, a soft ding echoes and the screen explodes in a sparkle of yellow-beige confetti. A tiny animated meerkat pops up beside a digital cactus, letting out a little squeak of celebration.\n\n Jenn's eyes go wide, like she's just witnessed something magical. \"[meerkatplushieName]! Oh my God, that is perfect. He sounds like someone who apologizes every time he sneezes,\" she gushes, her excitement bubbling over.\n\n You glance down at the plush in your arms. Its beady eyes seem to shimmer. \"Yeah,\" you murmur, a grin spreading across your face.\n\n Jenn taps a few more buttons, then spins the screen around so all of you can admire the result:\n\n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, [meerkatplushieName]!\n\n A digital badge appears beneath it that says \"Overthinker, Hug Magnet, Snack Enthusiast.\"\n\n Your mom leans in, chuckling softly. \"Hug magnet, huh?\"\n\n Lily bounces on the balls of her feet next to you. \"Snack enthusiast—that's so on brand.\"\n\n Jenn claps her hands. \"Alright! Let's make this official.\"\n\n She leads you to a pastel podium with a printer atop it. There's a quick whirr before a cream-colored certificate slides out, its textured paper faintly scented with vanilla.\n\n Jenn carefully presents it to you like it's a medal of honor.\n\n It reads:\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that [meerkatplushieName], a proud member of the PeekPal Series, has been lovingly adopted by [name] on this day. Though he lives in constant fear of loud noises and minor inconveniences, he will show up, be brave, and offer his tiny paws anyway. Provide snacks often. Encouragement always.\n\n You almost chuckle, but it feels too important to laugh out loud.\n\n Jenn wraps the plush in soft yellow tissue paper, sealing it with a sticker that reads: \"He's safe now.\" She places him gently into a sky-blue tote bag printed with Cuddle Creations' sleepy-moon and bear logo.\n\n \"Keep him close, alright?\" Jenn whispers, her tone suddenly tender. \"He's the kind that needs constant reminding he's loved. But I think you're exactly who he needs.\"\n\n Your mom steps forward and takes the bag, offering a grateful smile. You tuck the certificate into it, making sure it won't get crumpled.\n\n As you all step out of the cozy store back into the hum of the mall, your mom glances at you, a warm smile tugging at her lips.\n\n \"[meerkatplushieName]?\" she repeats, half-amused.\n\n \"I guess the name isn't too bad,\" Lily murmurs.\n\n \"He looked like a [meerkatplushieName],\" you say softly.\n\n Mom laughs lightly. \"Well, he looks like he'd worry if you didn't name him right.\"\n\n You share a quiet smile, heart full.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you whisper. \"But I think I got it right.\"\n\n \n You take a deep breath and hover your fingers over the screen for a moment, the cursor blinking expectantly. Then, gently, you type: [beeplushieName].\n\n The kiosk releases a cheerful ding, and the screen explodes in a riot of animated flowers, glitter trails, and pixely bees doing loop-de-loops—one bee even collides with a flower and spins comically in place.\n\n Jenn gasps dramatically, her eyes lighting up. \"[beeplushieName]! That is so, so adorable,\" she gushes.\n\n Your mom leans in, grinning. \"He's going to be the sweetest little buzz king.\"\n\n Lily, arms crossed, pipes up from behind you. \"Okay, I didn't want to admit it, but that's kinda cute.\" She tries to sound nonchalant. \"He looks like he'd start a pep rally to get me to do my homework.\"\n\n Jenn taps a few more buttons, smiling like she's officiating a heartfelt union. She turns the screen toward you both:\n\n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, [beeplushieName]!\n\n A digital badge appears underneath: \"Certified Encouragement Specialist – Level 1 Buzz\"\n\n Lily nudges your arm. \"See? He is an Encouragement Specialist. This plushie is basically a motivational speaker.\"\n\n \"Okay!\" Jenn claps her hand, bright and loud. \"Let's make it official.\"\n\n She guides you all to a curved podium where a printer hums to life. A cream-colored certificate glides out.\n\n Your mom leans in closer. \"A keepsake,\" she whispers with fondness.\n\n Jenn carefully presents the certificate with both hands, reverent, as if it's fragile glass:\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that [beeplushieName], proud member of the BuzzBuddy Support Squad, has been lovingly adopted by [name] on this day. Though he is often overwhelmed and mildly vibrating with panic, he will always try his best, encourage those around him, and commit to emotional support with great enthusiasm. Buzz responsibly.\n\n You blink at the words. A warm, confident little tug springs in your chest—an encouraging whisper that murmurs that you've got this.\n\n \"That's suspiciously cute,\" Lily says, staring at the certificate. \"I don't remember them doing this when I bought a plush.\"\n\n Jenn wraps [beeplushieName] in a sunny yellow tissue paper scattered with little daisies, then places him into a Cuddle Creations bag. She slides the bag toward you with a wink.\n\n \"Don't worry if he buzzes around a bit at first—he's nervous in new crowds. But give him a minute, and he's loyal as can be.\"\n\n Mom accepts the tote bag gently, looping the strap around her wrist. \"He's in good hands,\" she says softly.\n\n Lily reaches out, brushing a stray bit of glitter from the bag, then looks at you with a half-smile. \"Okay, he's basically family now.\"\n\n You tuck the certificate carefully into the bag, feeling the paper settle.\n\n As your trio exits the store, strolling into the mall's soft lighting, your mom glances at you with a knowing smile. \"[beeplushieName], huh?\"\n\n You give a bit of a shrug, nestling the bag in front of your chest. \"He just felt like he had a lot of feelings.\"\n\n Mom strokes the bag's fabric. \"That's a perfect match, then.\"\n\n Lily bumps your shoulder lightly and grins. \"He's so sweet. You better make sure he doesn't bother me, though. I don't want to hear buzzing when I'm doing my nails.\"\n\n You don't argue. Instead, you walk a little lighter.\n\n Sometimes, the right little friend is exactly what you didn't know you needed.\n\n \n Your mom pauses at the kiosk, the scruffy fox plushie resting in her arms. The screen glows softly in front of her as she hovers her fingers, then taps out the name:\n\n Percy.\n\n A soft ding sounds, and the screen blooms with golden-orange light. A tiny animated fox trots across it, twirling before it settles in the woods.\n\n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, Percy!\n\n A small digital badge appears underneath: \"Certified Resilience Specialist – Classy and a Little Worn In\"\n\n Jenn gasps, her hands fluttering to her chest. \"Percy! That's so sweet. He sounds like the kind of fox who wears cozy sweaters and knows exactly when you need a good cup of tea.\"\n\n Your mom laughs, and something is a little wet in her eyes. She gently strokes Percy's uneven head. \"Oh, he absolutely does.\"\n\n \"Percy?\" Lily repeats. \"It's very noble-sounding. I feel Percy's the type of fox to start a detective agency for lost feelings.\" She pauses, glances at your mom, and cracks a small grin. \"I'm saying it's nice.\"\n\n Jenn hits a few more buttons, and a soft whirring hum begins. A cream-colored certificate emerges, edges decorated with tiny acorns and pawprints. Jenn presents it reverently to your mom.\n\n The certificate reads:\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that Percy, a fox of patience, wisdom, and slight grumpiness in the mornings, has been lovingly adopted by Hannah on this day. May he bring comfort, companionship, and perfectly timed cuddles when the world asks too much and your tea gets cold. He may look a little scruffy, but that just means he's lived—and is still here.\n\n Your mom's breath catches. She stares at the paper like it holds the weight of something more—something she's needed.\n\n Jenn wraps Percy in warm orange tissue paper, securing it with a sticker that reads: \"He's safe now.\" She places him tenderly into a soft tote bag with the Cuddle Creations logo and hands it forward.\n\n Your mom hesitates—holding the bag like she's holding something fragile and precious. She presses it close to her chest, eyes shimmering.\n\n Jenn smiles, quietly content. \"He's a good one. Quiet but loyal. I think he's been waiting for exactly you.\"\n\n Your mom nods, brushing away a stray tear with her knuckle. She doesn't speak. Maybe she can't.\n\n As the three of you step out of the store, the afternoon light catches the bag in her hand. Lily links her arm with yours and your mom's—a small chain of togetherness.\n\n There's a pause in the noisy mall traffic, and then your mom murmurs, voice soft but full: \"Thank you, [name]. You didn't have to—but you did.\"\n\n \"He looked like he needed someone,\" you say, unable to wipe the smile off your face. \"And I figured... maybe you did, too.\"\n\n Your mom presses the bag even closer to her body. She glances at both of you—her two children that she loves more than anything. Her eyes shine with gratitude.\n\n Lily grins, nudging your arm. \"Careful, Percy might overtake us and become her favorite child.\"\n\n You all make your way to the center of the mall, fox in tow. No one's saying much anymore, but the silence feels full. Like everything that needed to be said already was.\n\n \n Lily stands at the kiosk, red panda plush cradled in her arms. The screen glows with pastel promise: Name Your Plush Friend.\n\n After a quiet beat, she taps at the keys:\n\n Mochi.\n\n A cheerful ding pops, followed by digital confetti, cherry blossoms, and a tiny animated red panda spinning across the display. Jenn watches with a bright smile.\n\n \"Mochi! That is so adorable,\" she coos. \"Perfect name. He's round and sweet, but definitely has some hidden sass.\"\n\n Lily's cheeks tint pink, but her grin is proud. \"Yeah, that's 'cause he's actually me in plush form.\"\n\n Your mom hovers beside her, eyes soft and warm as she stares at the red panda. \"Mochi, huh? I like it. It suits you.\"\n\n Jenn taps a few more buttons and turns the screen toward all three of you:\n\n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, Mochi!\n\n A small digital badge appears underneath: \"Certified Cuddle Connoisseur – Keep Him Close\"\n\n Lily bounces on her toes. \"Cuddle Connoisseur? Yes. That's definitely him.\"\n\n Jenn steps back and leads Lily to the printer. A cream-colored certificate slides into view, framed by bamboo shoots and little pawprints. With practiced care, Jenn presents it like a treasured keepsake.\n\n Lily takes it from her:\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that Mochi, a red panda of epic softness and undercover sass, has been lovingly adopted by Lily on this day. May he offer endless hugs, share secret snacks, and remind you that sometimes the sanest thing is a midnight plushie cuddle.\n\n Your mom's eyes mist over just a bit. \"He's going to take good care of you,\" she says, placing a hand on Lily's shoulder.\n\n Jenn wraps Mochi in soft tissue paper printed with mini bamboo shoots, seals it with a sticker, and places him into a gentle rose-pink tote bag.\n\n \"He's a keeper,\" Jenn murmurs. \"You two are going to be great together.\"\n\n Lily accepts the bag like it holds everything she needed, clutching it close. Her grin is huge and shaky with happiness.\n\n Outside the store, the soft hum of the mall returns—fluorescent lights above, echoing footsteps blending with distant chatter. It feels a little louder now after the hush of Cuddle Creations. But Lily doesn't seem to notice.\n\n She hugs to bag close to her chest, her arms wrapped around it like it might just float away if she lets go. The paper inside rustles gently as she shifts it, and for a second, she just stands there. Quiet. Still.\n\n Then she says, almost too casually, \"I really thought you were gonna pick one for yourself.\"\n\n You glance at her. \"Well, I was going to.\"\n\n She frowns, looking down at the tote again. \"But you didn't.\"\n\n You shrug. \"It felt more right to get you Mochi.\"\n\n She's quiet again, her grip tightening slightly.\n\n \"I mean...\" she starts, voice small. \"You didn't have to. I would've been fine.\"\n\n \"I know,\" you say, smiling. \"But I wanted to.\"\n\n Her eyes lift to yours then—wide, a little glassy. \"That was like... I dunno. Really nice of you. Nobody other than Mom has ever gotten me a plush before just 'cause.\"\n\n You open your mouth, but she keeps going, fast now, like if she doesn't say it all at once she'll lose the nerve: \"I mean, I know I mess around and say dumb stuff and I'm loud and annoying sometimes, but like... I see the stuff you do. And I'm really glad you're my brother. Or sister. Or whatever you're figuring out right now. Just—you. I'm glad you're you.\"\n\n Your mom pretends like she's not paying attention, but there's something tender in her expression that she doesn't try to hide.\n\n You smile at Lily. \"Thanks. I'm glad you're you, too.\"\n\n Lily sniffs and immediately makes a face. \"Ugh. Gross. Emotional sibling moment. I take it all back.\"\n\n You laugh. \"Too late. You said it.\"\n\n She grumbles under her breath but her smile gives her away. She hugs the bag tighter, like it means more than she knows how to say.\n\n And together, the three of you drift back into the mall like something small but important just settled into place.\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

It's stylish without being showy, like trendy doesn't need to shout.\n\nYou hover at the entrance for a second. Lily's already wading into the racks, inspecting tops. Your mom steps in beside you with a small smile, patient and steady.\n\nLily glances back, holding up a random top in front of her. \"Do you think this fits me?\" she asks, half-grinning. \"Honestly? I might just shoplift if this store has this many cute outfits. They can't expect me not to steal.\" She tosses the hanger casually and jogs over to another rack.\n\nYour mom sighs before bursting out into gentle laughter. \"Let's see what else they have, [name].\"\n\nThe store's gentle hum wraps around you—warm lighting casting golden pools across the racks of crop cardigans, puff-sleeve tops, and easy-fitting skirts. Lily browses with practiced ease, her fingers trailing over fabrics as she murmurs under her breath. \"They're all cute,\" she mutters. \"Might have to buy something later.\"\n\nA sales associate appears a few seconds later with an effortless bounce that suggests they've worn every piece in the store twice already. Their name tag reads \"Elle (they/them)\" and they catch the hesitation in your body language instantly. \"Hey there! Want a hand? I can pick out a few pieces you might like.\"\n\nLily perks up. \"Oh yeah, he definitely needs saving,\" Lily teases, but it's only sharp on the surface. \"Please, fashion rescue.\"\n\nElle vanishes, then returns with a small stack of clothes—nothing outrageous, just trendy pieces that seem to beckon.\n\nA path of curved racks lead toward the fitting room. \"Try whatever you like,\" Elle says, nodding to the track of stalls. \"No pressure.\"\n\nMom rubs your shoulder. \"Take your time.\"\n\n\"Don't freak out, alright?\" Lily half-jokes. \"I expect something cool.\"\n\nYou take a slow breath, feeling the new fabric on your fingers. There's warmth in the way Lily hovers, not getting too close, but not letting you disappear into the sea of clothes either. Your mom's silent kindness hums behind it all.\n\n\"Alright,\" you mutter, mustering up confidence. \"See you soon.\"\n\nLily gives you one last nod. \"You got this.\"\n\n\"We'll be right here,\" Mom echoes.\n\nAt the fitting rooms, you find a calm, welcoming space: soft lights, a mirror framed gently, and a wooden bench. You hold the chosen outfits like quiet treasures.\n\nYou step inside the changing room, closing the curtain behind you. The world softens to just you, the clothes, and a mirror.\n\n[Choice: Try outfits on]",

They settle onto your frame like they were waiting. There's no awkward tugging or uncomfortable shifting. Just warmth. Just you.\n\n The skirt swishes around your legs with a light, playful motion every time you move, and the top rests gently against your chest. You do a little turn in the mirror. You don't even flinch. Instead, you smile.\n\n You like what you see.\n\n There's a quiet thrill in how natural it feels. How your shoulders relax, how your posture changes without even thinking. This isn't pretending. It's discovering.\n\n You slip back into the clothes you wore in after, slower than usual, carefully folding each item as you place it back onto the hook. Your hand lingers on the black slit skirt. You hesitate.\n\n You glance at your reflection one last time, and your heart answers before your brain catches up.\n\n I want this.\n\n You step out, cheeks warming as the soft store music greets you again. Lily is the first to react, scooting forward.\n\n \"So... spill it. How was it?\" Her words tumble out, fast and real. \"Did it feel... okay?\" The question hangs between playful and earnest, wrapped tightly in that awkward care only a younger sister can deliver.\n\n You slump your shoulders a little and exhale. \"Yeah. More than okay, actually. It felt... good.\"\n\n You see your words echo in your mom's eyes: a swirling mix of surprise and pride. She steps forward, reaching out to squeeze your hand. \"Then it's perfect,\" she says. \"I'm glad it felt right.\"\n\n You glance down at the stack of clothes in your arms. It's not a costume. It's you, quietly taking shape.\n\n \"Are you gonna get it?\" Lily asks, tugging at her hoodie sleeves awkwardly. \"Like... for real?\"\n\n Mom watches Lily, then turns back to you—gentle authority in her gaze. \"It's your choice. If it feels right, go for it.\"\n\n You're not sure how much you'll buy. Maybe just one piece. But that doesn't matter. What does matter is you're buying something for you. And it feels like the person you're buying for is real.\n\n \n The clothes fit. Technically.\n\n The sleeves aren't too tight, the skirt falls just right, and the soft tops don't cling in a weird way. You look... fine. Objectively speaking, maybe even kind of good. You can imagine someone else wearing them and pulling it off without blinking.\n\n But as you stare at yourself in the mirror, you feel a weird kind of distance building between you and your reflection.\n\n You tug on the collar on the cream top. Adjust the waistband of the skirt. Do a half-turn.\n\n It's not bad, but it doesn't feel like you.\n\n You want it to. You try. You picture how this would look in public. Maybe if your posture was different or if your head was clearer. You sigh, pressing your palms against the sides of your thighs. You're not disgusted, not upset. Just... disconnected. Like this is someone else's closet and you're just borrowing their role.\n\n You change back, fold the pieces, and pick them up.\n\n You step out of the changing room and make your way toward the front, the sound of faint pop music following you. Your mom notices your silence, but doesn't say anything. She doesn't need to.\n\n You're not sure what, if anything, you'll buy.\n\n But something in you knows this wasn't really about the clothes. And maybe... maybe that's why it's so hard to decide.\n \n\n[Choice: Is there anything to buy?]",

It's not heavy, but it feels full—full of something real. You carried it here because inside is something that made you feel more like yourself, for once.\n\n Mom walks beside you, quiet and steady, her eys tracking your expression with warmth. She's not saying anything yet—she doesn't need to. You remember that caring look she gave when you emerged from the fitting room. You tried to hide how bright you felt, but she saw you anyway.\n\n Lily drifts up to your other side, her footsteps light. She glances at the bag, then you, with a half-smile.\n\n \"So,\" she says softly—quiet, but eager. \"You liked it, right?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, letting your shoulders drop. \"I liked it a lot.\"\n\n Lily nods, crossing her arms but still close. \"You looked comfortable,\" she says. \"I never saw you that comfy before. Not even in those cargo shorts.\"\n\n You laugh, not sure whether to be happy or offended. \"Thanks, Lils.\"\n\n Mom squeezes your shoulder as you pass a storefront window. Your reflection greets you—someone familiar but new, a version of you that isn't wrong. Not perfect, maybe—but clearer.\n\n \"It feels good,\" you admit, voice low.\n\n You walk a little taller after that. Still nervous. But proud. Like maybe—finally—you've taken a step not toward someone you're supposed to be, but toward someone you already are.\n\n \n You step out of NovaTrend holding the bag a little awkwardly, like you're not sure whether to treat it like a prize or a massive mistake.\n\n Mom walks beside you, eyes flicking to the bag. She doesn't say anything yet—maybe she senses the tightness in your chest, the way you're bracing yourself.\n\n Lily trails a step behind, brow furrowing and then smoothing back into her usual midway expression between teasing and caring. She clears her throat a little too loudly. \"So... how was it? You don't seem thrilled.\"\n\n You swallow, fiddling with the bag's edge. \"Yeah. It was... fine.\"\n\n The store associate had handed it to you with a smile and genuine goodbye. But now, with the bag in your grip, your heart skips uncertain beats. Will these clothes feel like home or a costume? Was it someone else you were shopping for?\n\n The lights feel brighter, the corridors more open. You find yourself half-checking your reflection in the glass storefronts.\n\n Mom reaches over, sensing your anxiety, and taps your back gently. \"You did okay in there,\" she says softly.\n\n Lily steps up beside you and nudges your arm. \"Yeah. You looked... good, I guess.\" She glances down, then straightens. \"Just wanted to say that.\"\n\n You force a small smile. \"Thanks.\"\n\n Lily clears her throat and kicks the tile floor with the tip of her sneaker. \"I mean, if it ever feels right, you should wear it. No pressure, of course, but... it looked good.\"\n\n Though the uncertainty still hums low, there's something steadier underneath: you tried. And sometimes, that's enough.\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

      "text": "Stepping into ShatterBox, you're hit with a wave of velvet darkness and electric energy—like a haunted mansion redesigned for alt fashion devotees. The walls are matte black, purple LED strips twisting around shelves like digital ivy, and the speakers pulse with slow, thudding bass. Posters featuring cult indie bands, surreal album art, and glitch-horror illustrations cling at odd angles, while mannequins stand in brooding poses—as if daring you to challenge them.\n\nYou step in, and your mom hesitates, giving you a small, questioning look before she steps back toward the door. Like she knows this place speaks in a language she's unfamiliar with—but also trusts you to figure it out.\n\nLily steps up beside you. Her hoodie gives her defense, sure, but her eyes still flick over everything with that spark of fierce curiosity she gets when she's encountering something new. \"Dude, this place is actually kind of badass,\" she breathes, voice lower than usual. \"Kind of exciting, not gonna lie.\"\n\nBefore you can respond, the sound of heavy boots—rubber soles striking concrete—echoes from behind a curtain leading to the back. The sales associate emerges, smeared black lipstick in a thin grin. Lace-up corset over a shredded band tee, a moon pendant larger than a toddler, and a confident aura like someone who wakes up to heavy metal.\n\nHer eyes scan you in a heartbeat, sizing up your vibe like she's deciding if you belong. She steps closers, boot chains jingling.\n\n\"Curious... or about to make a life-changing mistake,\" she says flatly. There's a dryness in her voice, but her grin tells you she's enjoying this. \"Either one's welcome.\"\n\nYou lift an eyebrow, feeling Lily shift closer.\n\n\"I'm just browsing,\" you say, wary.\n\nThe attendant snorts. \"Sure. That's what they all say.\" She gestures for you to follow her deeper in, between racks of distressed hoodies and gothic denim. \"You've got that 'I tried to bury my darkness, but it glowed from underneath' energy. You picking up what I'm laying down?\"\n\nYou stifle a laugh, but the associate doesn't pause. Instead, she continues weaving through the shadows of clothing rails.\n\n\"You know, there was a little glitch in the system last week. Half our stock got sent to inventory purgatory. Digital ghosts, if you will. We're only selling what survived the purge.\"\n\nShe stops and pulls a single hanger out.\n\n\"This made the cut,\" she declares like proclaiming a sacred relic. The piece she holds is a full outfit. Jet-black off-shoulder dress with a lace trim. There's a fitted belt with a little heart-shaped ring at the center. Attached to the hanger are fishnet tights, and dangling between the hem, a pair of heavy-soled combat boots with chrome buckles that look like they could crush a soda can, your self-esteem, and maybe even you in one stomp.\n\n\"Flagged for discard,\" she says. \"But I rescued it. Display item, kept in the back, waiting for someone with... potential.\"\n\nShe swings the hanger like a pendulum, her tone daring. \"And you have that potential.\"\n\nYour chest tightens.\n\nLily's eyes light up the second she gets a good look at the outfit. She steps closer, tugging her hoodie sleeves down over her hands like she's bracing for something way more intense than fashion.\n\n\"Okay,\" she says, voice careful like she's afraid to jinx it, \"that's actually kinda fire.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Fire?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I mean, it's dramatic as hell, but like... in a cool way,\" she says, circling it like she's appraising some weird museum piece. \"You'd look like you just stepped out of a music video. Oh! You could cosplay as a vampire girl that broods in libraries and has severe emotional damage.\"\n\nYou snort. \"That's very specific.\"\n\n\"It's a compliment,\" Lily states, grinning. \"I swear.\"\n\nYou take the hanger and turn it in your hands, watching how the lace catches the light, the little heart on the belt swinging gently.\n\n\"I don't know,\" you murmur. \"It's kind of a lot.\"\n\nLily shrugs. \"Yeah, it is. But sometimes a lot is good. Like, look at that lace trim. That's the kind of trim that makes a statement.\"\n\nYou hesitate. \"It's not really my usual vibe.\"\n\n\"Okay, true. You usually dress like you're a divorced dad,\" she shoots back, but her tone isn't mean. \"This is different, yeah. But maybe that's not a bad thing?\"\n\nThe sales attendant takes the hanger from you and flips it in her hand. \"Try it. Or don't. But if you don't, I guarantee some watered-down TikTok goth wannabe is gonna wander in later and ruin its potential.\"\n\nYou sigh.\n\n\"Well?\" she asks, raising her eyebrow. \"The fitting room's open and the mirror doesn't bite.\"\n\n[Choice: Try it on]\n[Choice: Decide against wearing it]",

Your fingers brush the lace edging, and something in your chest gives the tiniest tug.\n\n Maybe it's curiosity. Maybe it's a challenge. Maybe it's that voice that whispers \"what if\" before you can shut it down.\n\n You glance up at the goth girl. She's still watching, arms crossed and hips cocked like she's got all the time in the world. There's no smirk though, just quiet expectation.\n\n You swallow. \"Alright,\" you say. \"I'll try it.\"\n\n Her face lights up—not in excitement, exactly, but satisfaction. \"Knew it,\" she mutters. Then she hands over the hanger.\n\n The outfit feels heavier in your hands now that it's yours, even temporarily.\n\n You glance toward the fitting rooms, then back toward the front of the store—your mom is there, hovering just outside the entrance, pretending very hard that she isn't. She catches your eye and raises her brows. Lily catches it too and whispers, \"She's totally gonna freak if you come out looking hot.\"\n \n You don't say anything in response, opting to turn and walk toward the fitting rooms. Inside, the space is narrow and dim, with a single full-length mirror and a flickering overhead light that hums softly like it's judging you. You hang the outfit carefully, then start to change.\n\n The dress fits better than it has any right to. It slips over your shoulders and hugs your frame without clinging. The off-shoulder neckline brushes against your collarbones. The chain belt clicks softly as you tighten it, and when you step into the combat boots, you actually feel taller. Not just literally, but figuratively as well.\n\n You turn to face the mirror.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n For a second, you freeze.\n\n You barely recognize yourself. But not in a bad way.\n\n The person looking back at you fits into the moment. The black lace, the boots, the slightly chaotic layering of softness and sharpness—it all just makes sense in a weird way.\n\n You tilt your head.\n\n Maybe this isn't how you'd dress every day, but in this moment, you think you look pretty damn good.\n\n From outside the curtain, the attendant's voice cuts through:\n\n \"So?\"\n\n You take one more glance at the mirror before responding.\n\n \"I can't lie, it's kind of awesome,\" you call back, a little breathless.\n\n You hear a satisfied hum. \"Told you.\"\n\n [Choice: Step outside]\n\n \n You freeze before the dress, hand hovering. It's black lace whispers familiarity—even if you've never touched it before. That tiny thrill twists in your chest. But then your fingers curl away, retreating back to your side.\n\n You offer a polite smile. \"I don't think it's really me,\" you admit, voice steady.\n\n The sales associate pauses. The image of disappointment flits across her face—just for a heartbeat—before she recovers. \"Alright,\" she says, her voice calm as she puts the hanger back into place. \"No pressure. It's not for everyone.\"\n\n Lily steps beside you, leaning on a nearby rack. She gives the dress a final once-over, eyebrows raised. \"I'm not even into emo stuff, but it does look cool.\"\n\n The associate shifts and offers a dry laugh. \"Yeah... and if it doesn't get chosen today, it'll either get thrown away, sit in storage forever, or end up on some mall goth TikTok poser.\" She shrugs. \"But I guess it'll be here if you change your mind in the next few hours.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you whisper, and turn away.\n\n Lily watches the dress as it retreats into the racks. Her eyes flick to you, concern and pride mixing in her gaze. \"Hey, there's no shame,\" she says softly. \"It is a lot.\"\n\n The associate calls after you as you step toward the exit: \"Hope you find something that doesn't totally suck!\"\n\n The heavy music and moody lights of ShatterBox fade behind you, replaced by the mall's bright, neutral calm. You spot Mom waiting near a dusty potted plant, looking a bit relieved to be out of the darkness.\n\n \"Well,\" she says, voice gentle and curious. \"Find anything good?\"\n\n You glance at Lily, who just shrugs. \"There was this one outfit. Cute, but pretty intense.\"\n\n Mom arches an eyebrow. \"The whole store was intense.\"\n\n You chuckle softly. \"Definitely a vibe.\"\n\n Your mom gives you a warm nod. \"Some places speak to you. Others don't. And that's okay. You don't have to force it.\"\n\n You nod back, feeling a bit lighter.\n\n \"Also, did you see those boots?\" Lily asks. \"They looked like they could survive the end of the world.\"\n\n Your mom lets out a laugh. \"Why, are you thinking about buying a pair?\"\n\n \"Not for me,\" Lily replies, shrugging. \"But Mom, if you want something indestructible...\" She throws you a quick wink.\n\n \"At my age?\" your mom asks, giving Lily a stern look. \"My ankles wouldn't survive.\"\n\n Lily snorts, swinging an arm around your shoulders. \"Let's find something that doesn't require you to be a goth.\"\n\n You fall into step, and as the group moves forward, the moment behind you fades. You can just sense that ahead lies something else, something yours.\n\n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

The fabric feels snug, heavier than your usual clothes, but not uncomfortable. More like... intentional. Like it's holding something in place.\n\n Your heart is thudding. Not from fear, exactly. It's a sharper feeling, like when you're standing right at the edge of something and about to take the first step—not sure if you're going to fly or fall, but knowing you have to move.\n\n And then you step out.\n\n The boots thud softly against the concrete as you walk forward. You glance up and see yourself in the full-length mirror down the hall—and for a second, your mind just stops.\n\n You don't look silly. Or fake. Or like someone trying to be something they're not.\n\n You look real. Like this version of you has always been there, just waiting for permission to exist.\n\n Lily's eyes widen as she looks up from her phone, mid-scroll. \"Oh, dang.\"\n\n You blink, half expecting a joke. But she doesn't say anything else—just stares a second longer, then stands up straighter.\n\n \"Okay, that actually looks really cool,\" she says, trying to sound casual. \"It's not scary, unlike some goths. It's different. But good different.\"\n\n \"You think?\" you ask, the words quieter than you mean them to be.\n\n \"Yeah.\" Lily shrugs, but her voice is more sure this time. \"I mean, it's a lot of outfit, but you pull it off. You actually look kinda confident. And not fake confident. Like, real.\"\n\n You're not used to her sounding like this—less sharp, less performative. She's not throwing in a sarcastic punchline or trying to make it funny. She's just being honest.\n\n The salesgirl nods with a knowing smile. \"Told you. You've got the look.\"\n\n You let out a short breath—almost a laugh—and turn toward the mirror again. \"I... kinda love it,\" you admit.\n\n Lily shifts next to you. \"You should. You look like someone who's not afraid of anything.\"\n\n You glance at her, surprised.\n\n She immediately backpedals. \"Not, like, in a dramatic way. Just, y'know... braver than I'd be. I'd look like a deranged bat in that thing.\"\n\n You laugh, and she huffs, but her smile creeps back.\n\n Out at the front of the store, your mom finally looks up. Her eyes widen for a heartbeat—then she softens. There's no confusion or concern in her face. Just a steady pride. The kind that sees you fully and doesn't flinch.\n\n \"You wear that like you've been waiting for it, huh?\" the salesgirl says, tilting her head.\n\n Your throat tightens for a second, but you nod. Not shy, not scared. Just steady.\n\n \"Maybe I have,\" you say.\n\n And this time, it feels like the truth.\n\n \n You push the curtain open slowly, stepping out into the soft light of the shop, arms folded tightly over your chest. The boot thuds as you walk, and the dress sways a little more than you're comfortable with. You try your best to walk normally, to not overthink how the belt rests on your hips or how much shoulder the neckline shows.\n\n Lily looks up first from where she's sprawled dramatically across a black velvet chair near the fitting rooms. Her eyes widen.\n\n \"Oh my God, [name],\" she says, sitting up. \"You look like the final boss of a vampire video game. I mean that in a good way.\"\n\n You glance at the mirror.\n\n And... yeah. It fits. Technically. The look is bold, sure. But it feels like you're wearing someone else's skin. Like you're trying to pull off a part in a play you never auditioned for. You don't hate it—but standing there, you feel like everyone's staring at you. Even if they aren't.\n\n The store attendant lets out a low, approving whistle.\n\n \"Okay, wow. Didn't think you'd actually commit,\" she says, crossing her arms with a satisfied grin. \"But yeah, it looks good on you. Edgy but clean. Very creature of the night.\"\n\n You give a tight-lipped smile, fidgeting with the edge of the sleeve. \"I mean, it is cool. I'm just not sure if it fits me.\"\n\n Your mom looks up from her phone and blinks—clearly surprised, but not in a bad way. She stands, scanning you from head to toe.\n\n \"You look nice,\" she says carefully. \"It's a little different, but it doesn't look bad. Just takes some getting used to.\"\n\n You nod, unsure how exactly to respond.\n\n Lily stands now too, circling you slowly like a tiny fashion goblin. \"Okay, real talk? It works. I'm not saying you should, like, audition or anything—but you're 90% of the way there if you wanted to star in Twilight.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"And the other 10%?\"\n\n \"A tragic backstory,\" Lily says, grinning. \"And maybe eyeliner.\"\n\n You roll your eyes before looking back at the mirror. You don't hate what you see. But you're not sure if it's a door you're ready to walk through.\n\n Still... maybe trying it was the point.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

The outfit hugs you just enough to feel intentional. You're not sure it is about it, exactly, but you can't look away.\n\nLily stands just off to the side, quiet for once. She's chewing gently on a piece of gum (you don't know where it came from) and hugging her hoodie tighter around herself like she's not used to being in a store this dark and moody. But she keeps glancing at your reflection, then at you, then back again. She doesn't say anything, but her expression is that same one she makes when she's watching an emotional scene in a show and pretending it's not affecting her.\n\nThen the salesgirl saunters over. Her boots thud softly with each step, and she walks like she owns the place. Arms crossed, a half-smirk curling at the edge of her lip, she looks at you like you're a project she's proud of.\n\n\"So, are you buying it?\" she asks, like it's not even a question—just a formality.\n\nYou blink, a little startled by the bluntness. \"All of it?\" you ask, glancing down. \"Dress, boots, belt, choker, fishnets?\"\n\n\"Whole look,\" she says, gesturing lazily at your general direction. \"It came together weirdly well. Honestly, it's kinda rude how good it looks.\"\n\n\"It can't be cheap,\" Lily whispers.\n\n\"It really can't be,\" you respond. \"How much is it?\"\n\n\"Fifty bucks,\" she says.\n\nYou freeze. \"Wait—fifty?\"\n\nThe girl shrugs like it's nothing. \"Not a discount. A corporate screw-up. Clearance tags glitched out, I bundled it as a single display outfit, and here we are. Normally the boots alone are, like, eighty. That belt's from an indie designer who hand-makes stuff in her basement and charges triple if you breathe too loud.\"\n\nShe circles you once, slow and considering, then taps her chin with one painted nail. \"But today, and just today, the universe is feeling generous. You can get all of that for less than a new video game.\"\n\nYour mom, who's moved hanging out near the front counter, finally steps closer. \"That's actually kind of a steal,\" she says, tilting her head.\n\nThe goth girl grins and throws her a wink. \"Right? No soul-selling required. Unless you want to throw that in. We've got a form.\"\n\nYou glance back at the mirror. The you in the reflection looks more solid than usual.\n\n\"Dude,\" Lily says from beside you. \"I don't even like that kind of fashion, but it fits you. All I'm saying is, if I were you, I'd get it.\"\n\nYou glance at her, surprised.\n\nShe shrugs, then mutters, \"I think it's cool you even tried it on.\"\n\nThe salesgirl folds her arms again, waiting. \"No pressure,\" she says, softer this time. \"But like I said, you look like you get it. Most people don't.\"\n\nYou glance at your mom.\n\nShe meets your eyes for a second, then smiles. \"I did give you spending money,\" she says. \"And if it makes you feel like yourself... well, that sounds like a good purchase to me.\"\n\nYou look back at the mirror. The reflection stares back, steady and confident in a way that feels earned. You run your fingers lightly along the hem of the dress again, and you can feel your pulse in your throat—fast, not from fear, but from anticipation.\n\n\"So, what's the verdict?\" the salesgirl asks, tilting her head.\n\nYour reflection waits.\n\nSo do you.\n\n<<if [money] > 49>> \n [Choice: Buy it]\n \n[Choice: Don't buy it]",

The dress clings just enough, the boots make you feel grounded, and the belt, absurdly, feels like armor. There's a version of you staring back that looks self-assured and cinematic—like they walked straight out of a dream.\n\n \"I want it,\" you say, voice firm and quieter than expected.\n\n The goth salesgirl grins instantly, like she's been sitting on that smile the whole time. \"I fucking knew it. You've got the cheekbones and spirit for the outfit.\"\n\n Lily lets out a half-laugh behind you. \"I can't believe it,\" she says, her voice tinged with amusement.\n\n You step forward—still wearing the full outfit—and she doesn't ask you to take it off.\n\n \"Okay, look, technically I'm supposed to make people change before ringing them up,\" she says, unlocking the register. She glances up at you. \"But honestly? For this? We're gonna pretend that rule never existed. The vibes are too strong.\"\n\n She types something into the register, taps the screen, and then nods at the total. \"Fifty even. A full designer outfit for less than a full tank of gas. You've just hit a retail jackpot.\"\n\n You tap your phone against the reader without hesitation.\n\n Lily makes a small fist-pump behind you. \"Let's gooo,\" she whispers like she's watching a sports game.\n\n Behind you, your mom watches quietly, eyebrows lifted just a bit, her lips drawn into a line that's definitely trying not to smile too much.\n\n \"You sure?\" she says gently, giving you one last chance to back out.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"I'm sure.\"\n\n The goth girl hands you the receipt like she's passing over something sacred. \"Just wear it out,\" she says, almost reverent. \"It deserves to be seen.\"\n\n You turn toward the store exit. Your boots hit the floor with a soft thud, the choker catching a little light as you move. Your mom falls into step beside you, Lily just behind, spinning the shopping bag with your old clothes like she's guarding treasure.\n\n \"You really like it, huh?\" your mom asks.\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You nod. \"I do.\"\n \n \n \"I guess,\" you murmur.\n \n\n \"Well, let's go show it off a little.\"\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n You stand there for a moment longer, still facing the mirror.\n\n The outfit fits. It really does. Something about it clicks. But even so... it doesn't feel like something you can take home.\n\n You take a small breath, steadying yourself, and turn away from your reflection.\n \n \"I think I'm gonna pass,\" you say, your voice quiet but clear.\n\n The salesgirl arches a brow, surprised—but not offended. \"Sure. Little disappointing, but your call.\"\n\n Lily looks over the little jewelry rack where she's been pretending not to watch. \"Really?\" she asks, not judgmental, just curious.\n\n You shrug. \"it's cool. Just... not ready, I guess.\"\n\n She tilts her head, then nods like she gets it. \"Fair,\" she says. Then, quietly: \"Still think you looked kind of awesome, though.\"\n\n You smile faintly and slip back into the fitting room. The removal process feels slower than you expect—every buckle and zipper reminding you how easily this version of you can vanish again. But you fold the outfit neatly.\n\n When you hand it back to the salesgirl, she takes it without a word, just giving you a nod.\n\n As you step back out into the mall, the noise and light rush back in—normalcy hitting like a wave.\n\n Lily walks beside you, swinging her arms a little too dramatically. \"[name], if you ever do get that kind of outfit, I'm taking a thousand pictures,\" she says, giggling.\n\n <<if [confident] > [shy]>> \n \"Sure, I'll even pose for them,\" you reply.\n \n \n \"I'll break your phone,\" you reply.\n \n\n Your mom doesn't say anything at first, just places a hand on your back for a moment as you walk together. It's a quiet gesture, but steady.\n\n \"Not the one?\" she asks, finally speaking up.\n\n You shake your head. \"Cool look. Just... not today, I guess.\"\n\n And just like that, you're back in the mall crowd again. Still the same.

I might get one of these for myself later.\"\n\n\"Very fresh,\" Mom comments.\n\nThe next are the Vektix SwiftCharge Trainers. These look like speed incarnate. The soles have a jagged design in hot pink, with red and orange laces. They're made for movement, maybe for someone who's always in a rush.\n\n\"Woah, that's loud,\" Lily says, straightening up and arching an eyebrow. \"Looks like it's for a speedster or something.\"\n\n\"It kinda does,\" you reply.\n\n\"No one's going to miss you when you roll by in those,\" Mom laughs.\n\nLily wrinkles her nose. \"It's too bright for me. You'll blind me.\"\n\nThen, there are three flats from SomaSoft. They're simple, clean, and have no branding. They're in white, black, and brown. \n\n\"Boring old reliable?\" Lily asks with a roll of the eyes. \"Classic [name].\"\n\n\"They do go with everything,\" Mom says, chuckling.\n\n\"See, listen to what Mom's saying,\" you say, rubbing it in Lily's face. \"Nothing wrong with basics.\"\n\nLily scoffs, then shrugs. \"Fine. Sometimes easy is good.\"\n\nFinally, tucked near the end of the display, you notice a clean, minimal pair of SeraForm Streetlace Lights. They're all white with a sleek low-top profile and a matte finish. They don't scream for attention. They're not decorated or trendy, but they are sharp.\n\n\"Those look really versatile,\" your mom says. She then gestures to a bench by the displays. \"Why don't you try them on?\"\n\nLily gives you a sharp grin. \"Just don't trip while putting them on.\"\n\n[Choice: Try on the shoes]",

Lily is leaning against a nearby rack, watching with an amused half-smile.\n\n\"How's it feel?\" she asks, voice curious.\n\nYou exhale, shoulders loosening. \"Pretty good. I think I'm done trying.\"\n\nBefore you can say more, a sales associate—crew-cut, crisp store polo, clipboard tucked under one arm—steps forward with a polite smile. Lily gives him a quick once-over while Mom meets your eyes and gives a small, encouraging nod.\n\n\"Trying a few options today?\" he asks gently, eyeing the lineup of shoes on the bench.\n\n\"Yeah,\" you reply. \"Could I get the pricing?\"\n\nHe smiles and begins.\n\n\"First, the BreezeAir Lows with the butterfly design. That's a limited, designer collab—forty dollars. They're pretty in-demand right now.\"\n\nLily perks up and snatches the butterfly pair, giving them a little shake. \"Fancy but not too flashy. I can see why they're so expensive.\"\n\n\"The design is lovely,\" your mom states, chuckling softly. \"The price though...\"\n\nThe associate moves on to the neon trainers. \"These SwiftCharge Trainers feature breathable mesh and NeonGrip soles—designed for active days. Thirty dollars.\"\n\n\"Maybe these would come in handy if you decide to run a marathon or something,\" Lily jokes.\n\n\"Me? A marathon?\" you ask, grinning. \"More like dashing to class.\"\n\nThe associate then gestures toward the flats. \"The SomaSoft options—white, black, and brown—are everyday classics at fifteen dollars combined.\"\n\nFinally, his finger lands on the white low-tops. \"And these Streetlace Lights are twenty dollars. They've been popular for how well they match anything.\"\n\nFinished, the associate folds his hands behind his back. \"Take your time. I can box them up when you're ready.\"\n\nYou pause, looking at the four pairs. Butterflies, neon flair, classic flats, and the clean white sneakers. The soft bustle of the store fades into a hum as you weigh each.\n\nLily leans in close. \"No pressure, but I already have my eye on the butterfly ones. They're just right.\"\n\n\"Just trust your instincts, [name],\" Mom counters, voice calm and encouraging.\n\n[Choice: Choose some shoes to get]",

Could be the price. Could be uncertainty. Whatever it is, you're just not ready to step into new shoes right now.\n\n Lily stands beside you, hands tucked into her pockets. She glances over at the shoes, then back at you.\n\n \"You sure?\" she asks, voice soft but curious.\n\n You give her a small shrug. \"I think I'm good for now.\"\n\n Mom watches quietly from a few feet away, offering you a gentle, patient look. \"No pressure.\"\n\n The sales associate returns, offering a friendly smile. \"Have you decided yet?\"\n\n You manage to shake your head politely. \"I think I'll pass this time, thank you.\"\n\n He gives a professional smile—just slightly disappointed—but adds encouragingly, \"That's totally fine. Feel free to come back anytime. You've got a great eye.\"\n\n Lily gives a small, earnest smile. \"Yeah. You looked good with the Vektix shoes on. Just saying.\"\n\n You stand and slip back into your own shoes, brushing your hands on your top. Mom takes your arm slightly, and Lily falls in step beside you. Together, you step away from the bench and head toward the store entrance. The doors slide open behind you as you rejoin the mall's humming flow.\n\n You didn't leave with a new pair of shoes today—but that's okay. You went. You looked. Maybe next time you'll try again. And somehow, that feels like enough.\n\n \n \n You run your hand along the shoe one last time, the weight of the decision finally settling into something solid. Not pressure—just quiet certainty. These feel right.\n\n Lily is waiting beside you, arms crossed. She throws you a look that's half teasing, half genuine. \"You're getting it?\" she asks.\n\n You glance over at Lily, then your mom, then back to the shoes. \"Yeah,\" you nod. \"I'll get them.\"\n\n She smiles immediately, as if she was waiting for you to make the call on your own. \"That's great,\" she says softly. It's in her eyes: the pride of watching you choose on your own.\n\n The sales associate appears just in time. He's holding a box like he already knows what's next. \"Great choice,\" he says, offering a polite nod. \"I'll ring them up for you at the front.\"\n\n You follow him toward the register. Mom stands quietly beside you, her gaze content as you pay. Lily watches from a step back, having to stretch her neck to see the shoe get boxed.\n\n When the associate places the box in the bag and folds the receipt inside, he looks at you with a brief but sincere smile. \"Enjoy them.\"\n\n You return it before stepping out into the sharp clarity of the mall corridor. The bag swings lightly from your wrist, the new shoes settled inside like a quiet ally.\n\n Lily nudges your elbow. \"They look good,\" she says quietly, less teasing than before.\n\n \"They really do suit you, [name],\" your mom echoes.\n\n You look down at the bag. It's not really about the shoes. It's about the small, steady decisions that make you feel more you.\n\n It's not a full reinvention, but it is a step. And isn't that exactly what shoes are for?\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

The lighting's even harsher than the mall—bright overhead fluorescents that buzz faintly and wash everything in a slightly-too-white glow. The air smells like a mix of synthetic cotton, body spray, and something sharp that might be deodorant—or regret.\n\nLily halts just past the threshold. \"This store is having an identity crisis,\" she mutters, eyes wide as she takes in a wall of tees with slogans like \"Emotionally Overcaffeinated\" and \"Can't. Won't. Did anyway.\"\n\nYour mom's slower behind you, gaze sweeping the chaos. She lifts a hoodie that reads \"UNHINGED BUT TRYING\" and arches a brow. \"Wow,\" she says, voice edged with polite surprise. \"These are definitely... expressive.\"\n\nYou don't bother hiding your grin. \"It's kind of their whole thing.\"\n\nThe store feels like someone took the internet, distilled it into cloth, and added just enough sarcasm to make it fashion. T-shirts are folded in color-coded stacks, racks of hoodies are grouped by vibes instead of size—\"Cosmic Breakdown,\" \"Mildly Menacing,\" \"Sad But Festive.\" The aesthetic is chaos, but curated.\n\nA guy about your age with dyed blue hair and chipped black nail polish glances up from refolding a pile of shirts. He throws a casual peace sign your way. \"Let me know if you're spiraling about which graphic tee defines your soul,\" he says. You think he might be joking. Maybe.\n\nLily stares at a section labeled \"Hacker Princess\" like it just personally insulted her. \"If any of these shirts start talking, I'm out.\"\n\nYour mom sidesteps a display of bucket hats and heads toward a rack of oversized sweatshirts, running a hand over the fabric. She pauses at one that says \"Don't Talk to Me Unless You're a Dog or a Snack\" and squints. \"I can't disagree with this one.\"\n\nYou drift toward a stand-alone rack with dark tees printed with pixel art and cryptic phrases. There's a strange comfort in it. Like the clothes get it. There's a weird honesty here that isn't often present.\n\n\"Might just try a couple on,\" you murmur.\n\nYour mom glances over and gives a small nod. \"Definitely better than regretting it later.\"\n\nLily steps beside you, wrinkling her nose at a tank top with a glitter skull and crossbones. \"I still think this place is unhinged,\" she mutters. \"But it might work for you.\"\n\nYou glance back at the shelves, the soft chaos of the store humming around you like static you can almost understand.\n\n[Choice: Try some tops on]\n[Choice: Decide to leave]",

Threadz is, for lack of a better word, a curated chaos—every tee and hoodie feels like a statement, not just a purchase. There's a strange comfort in that energy, a freedom in deciding what kind of statement you want to make.\n\n From the display, your eyes settle on three pieces: first, the bold pink anime-style tee featuring a defiant girl with the words \"GAME OVER YOU LOSE\" behind her. It's loud—far from your usual look. Next, a tee covered in cartoon guinea pigs scooped up like ice cream cones—adorable and undeniably silly. And finally, the muted brown hoodie with a single orange-and-black butterfly stretched across its chest, strings artfully frayed, like it's already your favorite hoodie before you've even tried it on.\n\n You run a thumb over the hoodie's butterfly and lift it for inspection. Its softness calls to you. You glance over at your mom, who's leaning against the pin wall—tiny enamel snapshots of wrestlers, anime characters, retro game controllers, and more. She smiles and gives you a quiet thumbs-up, warm encouragement lighting her expression.\n\n Near her, Lily is scrolling on her phone, face illuminated by a TikTok. She glances up and smirks when she sees you holding the butterfly hoodie. \"Ooh, Mom-approved?\" she teases, then jerks a thumb at the anime tee. \"That one's... intense. You becoming a weeb now?\"\n\n You laugh, shrugging. \"Maybe? I just thought—why not?\" You lift up the anime tee, then the guinea pig one, trying not to crack a grin at how ridiculous the rodents look. Lily snorts. \"You look like you're assembling your mood wardrobe. Very deep.\"\n\n Your mom chuckles and nudges you. \"Try them all,\" she suggests. \"You'll know when one feels like you.\"\n\n As you hang the butterfly hoodie over one arm and roll the guinea pig tee over the other, you glance at Lily. \"Wish me luck.\"\n\n \"Good luck,\" she says, laughing playfully. \"I'll channel my inner fashion critic once you get out. Mom's also here for emotional support. Go get weird.\"\n\n At that moment, the blue-haired associate from earlier appears. \"Fitting room down the hall—second on the right,\" he calls with a grin. \"Skip the flickering one unless you're into haunted vibes.\"\n\n Gathering your three picks, you step toward the fitting rooms. Lily mock-salutes you. \"Good luck out there, wardrobe warrior.\"\n\n \"Take your time, alright?\" your mom says gently. \"I want to hear which one felt right.\"\n\n You nod and reach the curtain. For a moment, your heart skips—a mix of nerves and excitement. Then you push the curtain aside, stepping into the changing room. You close the curtain with a sense of determination. Here goes nothing.\n\n [Choice: Try on clothes]\n\n \n You pause mid-step, staring at the array of shirts: cryptic slogans, neon designs, and pastel anime prints. The store's loud buzz—the harsh fluorescents, the pounding alt-pop, the smell of cotton and deodorant—starts to feel overwhelming instead of energizing.\n\n Your mom, shuffling through hangers, glances up at you. \"Everything okay?\" she asks softly, noticing you've gone quiet.\n\n Lily is to shirts away, staring skeptically at an oversized tee reading \"Sad But Aesthetic.\" She peeks over and raises an eyebrow. \"You good, or are you planning to spend the next hour bringing me misery by analyzing fashion?\"\n\n \"Nah,\" you say, letting out a half-laugh. \"I think I'm just... not feeling this today.\" You glance between the chaotic colors and designs. \"Maybe I should just head out.\"\n\n \"If you're done, we can go,\" your mom says, tilting her head. \"Might hit up somewhere quieter.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I kind of want to go as well,\" Lily says, stepping over and draping an arm around you. \"This place gives my brain itchy vibes.\"\n\n \"We'll go somewhere else instead,\" your mom says, rubbing your shoulder gently.\n\n You nod and the three of you head toward the exit—lights buzzing overhead, the music turning into a distant thump behind you. As the door slides shut, the sensory overload fades, replaced by the mall's familiar calm.\n\n Together, you leave Threadz behind without a purchase. Maybe not picking anything is exactly the point.\n\n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

The kind that says you were able to find stuff you actually like. Things that feel like it belongs to who you are right now—not who you were or who you thought you had to be.\n\nYou and your mom slow near the center of the mall, in that wide-open spot where all the escalators cross. For a second, you both just... stop. No rush. No errands left. Just you, her, and the quiet buzz of mall chatter in the background.\n\nShe glances at the bags in your hand. \"You picked a lot of really different stuff today,\" she says. Not judging. Just noticing.\n\n\"Yeah,\" you say. Then, after a beat: \"I think I wanted to see who I might feel like.\"\n\nShe hums at that, like she's rolling the words around in her head. Then she nods.\n\n\"Well,\" she says, slinging her purse higher on her shoulder, \"whoever you're feeling like today... looks pretty good to me.\"\n\nHer words hit in a weird place. It's as if you've been holding your breath for too long, and just finally got to exhale.\n\n\"Well, thanks for coming with me,\" you say, cracking a small smile. \"I know this wasn't exactly your idea of a Thursday.\"\n\n\"Are you kidding, [name]?\" she says, her eyes warm. \"Getting to spend the afternoon with you, just the two of us? I don't get that as much anymore. It's been really nice.\"\n\nYou look over, and you can tell she's being sincere.\n\n\"I missed this,\" she says, squeezing your hand with hers. \"Just being with you. Watching you try things, figure yourself out a little. I'm proud of you, you know.\"\n\nYou glance away, cheeks warm, but you don't hate hearing it. Not even close.\n\n\"C'mon,\" she says gently, nodding toward the familiar glow of the food court. \"Let's grab something to eat. My treat. I think we've earned it.\"\n\nYou follow her, the bags in your hands swinging lightly with each step, and something settles in your chest.\n\nYou feel... safe.\n\n[Choice: Time to eat]",

      "text": "The food court is buzzing with the usual chaos—laughter, trays clattering, the hum of soda machines, and the comforting scent of everything fried, grilled, or baked in bulk. You and your mom weave through the crowds, dodging strollers and shopping bags until you find a quiet corner table tucked near a big fake plant.\n\nShe sets her purse down on one of the plastic chairs with a tired little sigh and eases into the seat, giving the bags at your feet a quick glance. \"We did some damage,\" she murmurs, half-smiling.\n\nYou sit across from her, stretching your arms out a little. \"Totally worth it, though.\"\n\nShe nods, then reaches into her wallet, pulls out a card, and places it gently on the table between you. \"Alright,\" she says, trying to sound official. \"Go get whatever you want. Seriously. Meal, drink, even dessert—I don't care. You earned it today.\"\n\nYou blink. \"Anything?\"\n\nShe gives you a look. \"Do I look like I'm joking? Go. I'll guard the bags.\"\n\nYou glance toward the ring of food stalls. There are more than a dozen places lit up in neon lights and grease-scented glory. A few kids race past yelling about honey mustard. Somewhere nearby, a blender screeches through a smoothie.\n\nYour mom leans back in her chair, looking genuinely content. \"Just get something that's not going to give you a stomachache by the time we're back in the car.\"\n\n\"No promises,\" you state, pushing up from the table.\n\nShe just shakes her head and waves you off. \"Go on.\"\n\nPizza Hüt is a proud European chain that acts like putting an umlaut in the name makes their pizza cultured. The pizza's fine, but the crust is oddly sweet and the pepperoni looks like it was printed on. It's the kind of spot you eat at and then wonder if maybe you were just really hungry.\n\nLoud branding, flat burgers, and enough sauce to coat your soul. That's Burgur Kween. The combo deals are suspiciously cheap, and everything comes wrapped in foil with marketing slogans like \"SLAY THE CRAVE.\" It doesn't help the fact that their burgers look like they've been sat on, though.\n\nKansas Fried Poultry is the home of greasy chicken and coleslaw no one ever finishes. It was founded by General Thatch, whose portrait still hangs in every location—white suit, bolo tie, and a thousand-yard stare. They swear by their \"Legendary Eleven-Dust Blend™\"—you're pretty sure most of the taste comes down to the MSG though. No one knows what's in the gravy, but you eat it anyway. General Thatch would want you to be brave.\n\nTacko Bong is Tex-Mex, but barely. You order it because it smells good, then immediately question your decisions mid-bite. It's fast, cheap, and tastes decent going in. But let's be honest here—you know what happens next. There's a reason why every bathroom stall near a Tacko Bong is mysteriously out of order.\n\nKoala Express is an aggressively average Chinese fast-food chain that's somehow in every mall, airport, and food court, even though no one remembers it actually opening. The food is comforting in a suspiciously consistent way. The real mystery is the mascot: a grinning koala in a silk robe, holding chopsticks. No one knows why exactly an Australian marsupial is representing orange chicken, and the brand has never explained it. You're not here for the authenticity though—you're here because it smells good and hits the same way every time.\n\n[Choice: Pizza Hüt]\n[Choice: Burgur Kween]\n[Choice: KFP - Kansas Fried Poultry]\n[Choice: Tacko Bong]\n[Choice: Koala Express]",

      "text": "You approach the glowing red sign of Pizza Hüt—\"Est. in Düsseldorf\" printed beneath it in proud serif font. It's like you're entering enemy territory. The whole stall has a certain... vibe. Cold efficiency. The staff wear crisp red aprons and stare at you like they've been trained in the harshest of kitchens.\n\n The guy at the counter is tall, severe, and looks like his soul was forged in a bread oven. His name tag just reads GÜNTER.\n\n \"Willkommen to ze Hüt,\" he says, with zero inflection. \"You vill be having ze pizza, ya?\"\n\n You blink. \"Uh... yeah. Just a slice of pepperoni—\"\n\n \"Peperoniwurst.\"\n\n He types something with aggressive precision.\n\n You look at the menu. It's technically in English, but every word has been rebranded into something that nears parody. Zauce, Krustenplatte, Mozarrella der Schmeltz. There's a combo meal called \"Die Trilogie der Käse.\" It's just a three-cheese pizza.\n \n \"What drink comes with it?\" you ask.\n\n He doesn't answer. He just slides you a room-temperature orange soda with the label peeled off. You're not convinced it's carbonated. Or legal.\n\n Five minutes later, your slice arrives in a little cardboard tray printed with the phrase \"Life ist kurz. Eat die Hüt.\" There's a parsley leaf on it.\n\n You carry your food back to the table where your mom's been waiting, sipping her iced tea. She raises an eyebrow as you sit down. \"How was it?\"\n\n You place the slice down. \"Efficient,\" you say. \"They didn't smile. I respect that.\"\n\n She peeks into the tray. \"Is that parsley?\"\n\n \"Apparently it is,\" you reply. \"It's cultural. You wouldn't get it. Too American.\"\n\n You take a bite. The sauce is sweet. The crust is tough. The pepperoni tastes fine, but somehow very disciplined.\n\n Your mom watches you chew, trying not to laugh. \"Well?\"\n\n You nod solemnly. \"The Hüt delivers.\"\n\n There is no joy, only structure and the faint scent of oregano.\n\n \n The scent of flame-grilled something smacks you the moment you pass under the neon crown-shaped sign. Burgur Kween isn't quiet. The whole place radiates confidence, hot grease, and glittery chaos. Purple lights frame the menu board. The soda machine's blasting music. And the staff? They are living in the moment.\n\n Behind the counter stands a tall server with long acrylic nails, gold hoop earrings, and a perfectly tied apron that looks more like a fashion statement than a uniform. Their name tag reads \"Miss Patty\", in Sharpie, with a tiny lipstick kiss drawn next to it.\n\n \"Well hellooo, look who just stepped into the best restaurant in town, honey,\" they say, leaning dramatically on the counter. \"What's your vibe today? Feeling crunchy? Crispy? Or just extra?\"\n\n You blink. \"Um... just a cheeseburger?\"\n\n Miss Patty places one hand on their hip and gasps. \"Just a cheeseburger? Baby, no. We don't do 'just' here. We do bold, juicy, life-changing.\"\n\n Someone in the back yells, \"Drop a royal patty and crown it, darling!\"\n\n Patty turns back to you. \"That's for you, sweetness.\"\n\n You look up at the menu, which is a fever dream of specials with names like \"The Glam Stack,\" \"Double Drama,\" and \"The Untucked Combo.\" You order a single burger and fries, and Patty nods like you've chosen your house for the season.\n\n \"Ooh, a classic. Simple. Confident. I respect it. You don't need the extra sauce—you are the flavor.\"\n\n They slide your receipt across the counter with a wink. \"Grab a straw with attitude, not one of those flimsy basic ones.\"\n\n You make your way back to your mom at the table, holding your tray like it just got blessed by royalty. She raises an eyebrow. \"That... looked like a whole production.\"\n\n \"Oh, it was,\" you say, unwrapping your burger. \"And honestly? I felt seen.\"\n\n She snorts into her iced tea. \"Well, as long as the fries live up to the drama.\"\n\n You take a bite, and they most certainly do.\n\n \n The smell hits you before the sign does—grease, salt, black pepper, and a kind of smoky defiance that makes it clear you didn't come here to be healthy.\n\n Kansas Fried Poultry squats in the corner of the food court like it owns the mall. The logo's just a silhouette of the state of Kansas wearing a cowboy hat, and the man behind the myth—General Thatch—is everywhere. His framed portrait hangs behind the counter, squinting like he's seen combat and invented cornbread in the same week. His statue holds a chicken drumstick like it's the Declaration of Independence. There's even a tattered American flag above the counter.\n\n The counter girl's leanin' on the register like it owes her money. Her faded name tag just says Mary-Beth and her apron's got cornbread batter scars.\n\n \"Well, hey there, sugar,\" she drawls, voice slow as sweet tea left out in August. \"You look like somebody with a deep hunger and questionable judgment. Lemme fix that fer ya.\"\n\n You open your mouth to ask a question, but she's already shaking her head.\n\n \"Nuh uh. We don't do menus. We do chicken. Hot, proud, and real enough to bring a tear to your meemaw's eye.\"\n\n She turns and bellows into the back without looking. \"Drop two thighs in the fire! And throw a mercy biscuit in there too, bless their heart!\"\n\n She slaps a bucket on the counter with a thud that feels spiritual.\n\n \"Y'all enjoy now,\" Mary-Beth says, wiping her hands on a rag that might've fought in the war. \"And if it don't light a fire in yer chest, we'll bury ya with honor.\"\n\n You carry it back to the table like it's holy.\n\n \"Wow, that chicken smells really good,\" your mom says.\n\n You sit down, steam fogging the inside of the bucket. \"She called me sugar then judged my soul.\"\n\n \"As she should.\"\n\n You bite in. The skin cracks like thunder and the spice hits like a sermon.\n\n General Thatch didn't make chicken. He made a legacy.\n\n \n The closer you get to Tacko Bong, the more it smells like a college dorm microwave and the inside of a tortilla chip bag. Not bad, necessarily—just chaotic. There's a faded mural on the wall of a cactus wearing sunglasses and a beanie, holding a burrito like it's the Holy Grail. A little sign on the register reads: \"Now Hiring. No Snitches.\"\n\n The guy behind the counter has half-lidded eyes and a name tag that says \"Chaz\", drawn in Sharpie. He's got a bandana tied around his head and a string of hot sauce pockets clipped to his belt like ammo.\n\n He stares at you for a long second after you approach. Almost as if he's buffering.\n\n \"...Yo,\" he says finally. \"You, uh... hungry?\"\n\n You nod.\n\n He nods too.\n\n \"That's sick. Me too, man.\"\n\n There's no real menu—just a few laminated photos taped crookedly to the sneeze guard. Cruncho Loco Supreme, Nacho Nacho Situation, and the Mystery Quesadilla (No Refunds).\n\n \"I can, like... throw some stuff in a tortilla?\" Chaz offers. \"We got beans. Probably.\"\n\n A second guy appears from the back. You didn't hear him come out. His name tag says \"Spoon\", and he's holding a ladle full of neon-yellow cheese like it's a sacred artifact.\n\n \"Dude, you want the drip?\" he asks. \"We got the drip.\"\n\n You pause. \"What exactly is the drip?\"\n\n He gestures at the ladle. \"This. This is the drip.\"\n\n Chaz nods solemnly behind him, \"It's, like, spiritual.\"\n\n You order something that sounds vaguely like a taco, hand over the card, and watch as they begin to construct your meal with an intense focus. There's a lot of unlabelled containers. You choose not to ask.\n\n Minutes later, you're handed a loosely wrapped bundle of tortilla, heat, and vibes. It drips. You're not sure what. But it drips.\n\n You carry it back to your mom, who looks at your food like it just said something offensive.\n\n \"...What is that?\"\n\n \"I don't know,\" you say, unwrapping it. \"I think it's... nacho-adjacent.\"\n\n She raises an eyebrow. \"Is it safe?\"\n\n \"The guy who made it called it 'a transcendental bean event,' so...\"\n\n \"So it's not safe,\" she states, blinking.\n\n You take a bite.\n\n It's hot. It's gooey. It tastes like processed comfort and real consequences.\n\n You nod slowly.\n\n \"...This is gonna wreck me.\"\n\n And you take another bite anyway.\n\n \n You spot the waving golden cat before anything else—perched proudly on the counter of Koala Express, its paw moving in slow, hypnotic arcs like it knows something you don't.\n\n The menu board glows red and gold, slick with laminated sheen, listing a staggering number of combos and sides. Every single one comes with two entrées and a side. The trays are already stacked, wide enough to double as life rafts.\n\n The server behind the counter doesn't look up as she greets you. \"Hi, welcome to Koala Express. Do you want a combo or box today?\"\n\n You glance down at the steam table. There's orange chicken glistening like a sunset, beef and broccoli soaking in sauce, and fried rice piled so high it's got elevation. Everything smells like soy sauce and sugar.\n\n \"A combo?\" you offer.\n\n \"Good choice. Two entrées, one side. Orange chicken?\" She's already spooning it into your tray before you nod.\n\n You pick a second dish. It doesn't really matter what you choose, they all look like they've been prepared by someone who knows what your soul needs and doesn't believe in small portions. The food is heaped on like gravity's on break. By the time she finishes adding a scoop of chow mein, your tray weighs more than your dignity.\n\n She throws in a crushed fortune cookie and an extra packet of soy sauce for \"flavor insurance.\" Then comes the plastic lid, taped shut with serious intent. It barely fits. You nod your thanks, hand sinking under the weight as you turn to head back.\n\n Your mom eyes the tray as you drop it onto the table.\n\n \"Jesus Christ,\" she mutters. \"They feed entire schools with less.\"\n\n \"It's a combo meal,\" you say, out of breath.\n\n You pry the lid open. Steam floods out. You haven't even touched the food yet and somehow your fingers are already sticky.\n\n She peeks inside. \"How much rice is that?\"\n\n \"A lot,\" you say solemnly, cracking open the fortune cookie. The paper is smudged and slightly torn, but still legible:\n You are full of potential. And also rice.\n\n You nod, like it's a prophecy.\n\n Time to eat.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "You pause for a second, staring down at the tray. There's a tightness in your chest that wasn't there a moment ago—not fear exactly, but something like bracing for impact. And yet, despite all that, the words come easier than you expected.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, quieter than you meant to. \"I actually felt really good.\"\n\n Your mom stops mid-sip, lowering her drink just slightly. She doesn't look surprised—just attentive, like she was ready to catch this moment if it happened. Her eyes soften immediately, but there's no smile yet. Not even a reaction. Just stillness. Space for you to keep talking if you want.\n\n You do.\n\n \"I don't know,\" you continue, shifting in your seat, \"when I looked in the mirror, it didn't feel like a costume. It didn't feel fake. I just felt... more like myself. Which is weird, I guess.\"\n\n Your mom tilts her head slightly. \"That's not weird at all.\"\n\n You glance up, expecting caution or concern, but she's already nodding slowly.\n\n \"[name], you looked comfortable,\" she says. \"Not just how it fit, but how you stood. How you carried yourself.\"\n\n You blink, surprised by the detail. \"You noticed that?\"\n\n She finally smiles. \"Of course I did. I know you. And you seemed... lighter.\"\n\n You sit with that for a moment. Lighter. She's right, even if you haven't put that word to it yet. You remember how your reflection made you smile, how your body didn't feel like something you had to brace against. You just felt like you. Wearing something that felt right.\n\n \"Does that scare you?\" you ask, voice barely above a whisper.\n\n Your mom shakes her head, seeming completely sure. \"No, honey. What would scare me is if you thought you had to hide from yourself just to make other people comfortable.\"\n\n That sits heavy.\n\n You look back down, then up again. You don't say anything else, but she doesn't need you to.\n\n Her hand just rests on the table, palm up, open.\n\n You don't even think. You just place yours in it. She squeezes gently.\n\n That's enough. For now.\n\n \n You shrug as you take a bite. \"It was fine,\" you say. \"I dunno.\"\n\n Your mom watches you for a moment—quiet, but not pressing. She chews slowly, then sets her cup down and rests her chin on her hand, elbow braced on the table.\n\n \"Fine as in... it didn't bother you? Or fine like you didn't hate it but you're not sure what to do with it.\"\n\n You pause. You're not sure which lands closer to the truth, and you're certainly not ready to unpack anything. Not right now. You just give another little shrug.\n\n She just nods, her gaze softening as she leans back in her seat.\n\n \"Well,\" she says, folding her napkin slowly, \"figuring things out doesn't always feel like lightning. Sometimes it's just... trying something on. Seeing how it fits.\"\n\n You glance down again, unsure if she means the skirts and shirts or something bigger. Maybe both.\n\n She takes a breath like she's going to say something else—but doesn't. Instead, she pops more food into her mouth, letting the silence settle into something easy again.\n\n You don't say anything either.\n\n And that's okay.\n\n \n \n \n The taste of everything suddenly feels muted. You glance down, then back up, trying not to shrink under the softness in her expression.\n\n \"Not really,\" you say, after a moment. \"It felt... off. Like I was pretending or something. Like I was trying on someone else's life.\"\n\n Your mom nods slowly, her face unreadable for a second—then carefully, she lifts her drink and takes a small sip.\n\n \"Okay,\" she says. \"Thanks for telling me.\"\n\n You expect more, but she doesn't go there. She doesn't try to convince you otherwise. Instead, she sets her drink down and looks at you calmly.\n\n \"You've been through a lot lately,\" she says. \"Your body's changing in ways you didn't choose. And I know it probably feels like everyone's waiting for you to figure out what it all means, but you don't owe anyone a full answer. Not even me.\"\n\n You nod, a little tension slipping from your shoulders.\n\n She adds, with a dry smile. \"That being said, I did get some cute pictures of you shopping. So if you do ever decide you want to lean into it... you've got options.\"\n\n \"Mom...\" you groan.\n\n \"What? I'm not saying to post them. I'm just saying you looked good, even if it didn't feel right.\"\n\n Somehow, her words makes it easier.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Her iced tea is still cold, but she doesn't reach for it. Her hands are folded in front of her now.\n\nWhen she speaks again, her voice is low—not hushed, but careful. Careful in that way mothers are, where every word is placed with intention.\n\n\"I'm going to ask you something even more personal than earlier, if that's alright,\" she says.\n\nYou nod before you can fully think about it.\n\nShe watches your face for a second, like she's checking to make sure she can really ask. Then:\n\n\"[name], when you were younger,\" she begins, and already her voice softens even more, \"did you ever wish you were a girl?\"\n\nShe doesn't say it like she's trying to catch you. It doesn't come with an edge. It just lands softly between you, a question that's clearly been sitting with her—not in fear, but in love. The kind of question a parent doesn't ask unless they really want to know you.\n\nAnd suddenly, it's not about the food, or the mall, or even the clothes you tried on. It's about something older and deeper, something that may have sat inside you for a long time. Almost like a memory that never had a name.\n\nShe doesn't rush you, she just waits.\n\n[Choice: Yes]\n[Choice: No]",

The moment is too fragile for denial, and honestly... you're tired of dodging pieces of yourself like they're landmines.\n\n So you say it.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you murmur, voice low but steady. \"Sometimes.\"\n\n Her fingers twitch against the edge of her napkin, like she's rewinding through years in her head all at once—rewatching childhood birthday parties, Halloween costumes, grocery store tantrums, and quiet silences in dressing rooms. Her eyes don't leave yours, but you can see her going back. Connecting threads she never even thought to tie together.\n\n She doesn't cry. Not at first. But her voice cracks when she speaks again.\n\n \"Why didn't I see that?\"\n\n \"It's not your fault,\" you state, shaking your head.\n\n \"I know, I just...\" She lets out a slow breath, blinking hard. \"I think about all the times you seemed uncomfortable and I just chalked it up to being shy, or stubborn, or hitting a weird phase. I thought it would pass, I really did. I didn't think to ask if maybe you felt... different.\"\n\n You're not sure how to even respond. You never said it out loud before—not to her, not to anyone. But now that the words are in the air, they don't feel like a bomb. They feel like a truth that's been waiting for daylight.\n\n She covers her mouth for a second, breath catching, then lowers her hand.\n\n \"I remember you wanted to be a witch one Halloween,\" she says softly, voice trembling. \"And I kept steering you toward the wizard costumes. I thought I was being helpful. I thought... I was being practical.\"\n\n You look at her. Really look. Her eyes are wet, but her expression is open—aching, but full of love.\n\n \"I would've let you,\" she says, barely above a whisper. \"If I'd known. I would've... I would've made you the best little witch cape in the world.\"\n\n That does it.\n\n Your throat tightens, but the tears don't fall. Not yet, anyway. There's just this strange warmth beneath your ribs, soft and sharp all at once.\n\n You don't need to reassure her. Not right now. She's not beating herself up, she's simply grieving what she missed.\n\n She reaches across the table again and takes your hand, gently, like she's holding something precious. And maybe she is.\n\n \"I am so, so proud of you,\" she says, \"for saying it. For knowing it. For even wondering about it. You don't have to have answers, [name]. Just please keep being honest with yourself.\"\n\n You nod, your fingers squeezing hers in return.\n\n For a long moment, neither of you say anything. The mall buzzes on around you. Unimportant. Distant.\n\n But here, at this tiny food court table, something real has been named.\n\n And you are not alone.\n\n \n You pause, let the question hang in the air, and then quietly shake your head.\n\n \"No,\" you say. \"Not really. I never... wanted to be a girl when I was younger.\"\n\n Your mom doesn't flinch. Doesn't look relieved or disappointed—just thoughtful. Like she was holding space for either answer, and is still holding it, even now. She nods slowly, more to herself than to you.\n\n \"Okay,\" she says softly. \"Thanks for being honest.\"\n\n She leans back in her chair, folding the edge of her napkin between her fingers. Her gaze lingers in the distance, like she's sorting through her thoughts carefully before saying any of them out loud.\n\n \"I only asked because... I don't know. Watching you lately, I just started wondering if maybe there was something I'd missed. Something you were trying to say, even if you didn't know how.\"\n\n You glance down at your tray, not sure what to say to that.\n\n \"I know things are changing,\" she adds, gentler still. \"Your body, your style, how you see yourself. And I don't want to make any assumptions, [name]. I just want to make sure I'm not shutting out possibilities because I didn't see something early on.\"\n\n You nod. You don't feel misunderstood. If anything, you feel seen—as someone still figuring things out, even if the answer to this particular question is clear.\n\n \"I didn't wish I was a girl,\" you say again, firmer this time. \"But I get why you might have wondered.\"\n\n Her eyes meet yours, full of steady warmth. \"I'm not trying to put a label on you. I'm just trying to stay close. However this goes.\"\n\n That's what hits. Not the question. Not the moment. Just the willingness to be there, even if the road looks different than either of you expected.\n\n She smiles. \"Thanks for answering.\"\n\n You smile back. \"Thanks for asking.\"\n\n And for now, that's enough.\n \n\n[Choice: It's time for the drive home]",

It's quieter now, the rush of shoppers fading into a kind of calm. You and your mom walk side by side toward the car, your arms full of bags, your steps unhurried.\n\nWhen she opens the trunk, you both fall into an easy rhythm—bags handed off, tucked neatly into corners, heavier things layered at the bottom, soft ones cradled on top. She's careful with everything, like she's not just packing up clothes and receipts. After a few minutes, the last bag slides into place with a soft rustle. She closes the trunk gently, like she doesn't want to wake a sleeping thing.\n\nThere's a brief pause. A breath of quiet between tasks.\n\nThen she gives you a small smile and nods toward the passenger door.\n\n\"Come on,\" she says.\n\nYou both get in—the doors thud shut, and the outside world muffles. The car is warm, filled with the quiet scent of leather and something floral from one of the bags. For a moment, you sit there, letting the stillness settle.\n\nThen she turns to you, keys still in her hand, her voice low.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she says. \"For coming with me today.\"\n\nYou open your mouth to say something, but she keeps going.\n\n\"Not just for shopping,\" she says. \"For letting me be there. For letting me see you—really see you. I know it's not always easy to let someone in when you're changing, when you're figuring yourself out. But you let me come along for the ride.\"\n\nShe brushes something off your sleeve that probably wasn't even there, and her hand lingers for just a second before falling back to her side.\n\n\"[name], I need you to know this,\" she continues, steady now. \"Whatever happens—whatever you decide, whatever you feel, whoever you are—I am on your side. Always. That doesn't change. Through thick and thin, through confusion and clarity, through bad hair days and identity crises and whatever else life throws at you.\"\n\nYou look at her, and there's something in your chest that aches—but in a good way.\n\nFor a moment, neither of you speak. The car's quiet, warm with the fading sun, and the hum of the mall in the distance slowly fades.\n\n\"I'm your mom,\" she states.\n\nShe lets it sit there for a second. Not as a performance—just as fact.\n\n\"That's not something I say lightly,\" she continues. \"It's not about biology or birthdays or signing permission slips. It's... showing up. Seeing you. Staying when things get confusing, even when neither of us has the words.\"\n\nShe breathes in slowly through her nose, looking ahead through the windshield for a moment before her gaze returns to you.\n\n\"I've watched you change. I've seen you struggle, and stumble, and try to hold yourself together when it didn't make sense. And none of it—none of it—made me love you any less. Not for a second.\"\n\nHer hands rest near the gearshift, not reaching for yours, not asking for a moment—just there, a quiet offer.\n\n\"I don't know everything. I probably won't always get it right. But I'm not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm right here, [name]. You are not alone in this.\"\n\nYou can tell she means it.\n\n\"I'm your mother. That means something. And it always will.\"\n\nAnd there's nothing else to add.\n\n[Choice: To home with Mom]",

It's some song from her high school days, too low to recognize but familiar enough to soothe the silence.\n\nShe looks tired. Not drained, just comfortably worn out, like something who gave the day all she had and is glad for it. She has one hand on the wheel, the other occasionally brushing her hair back, eyes soft when they flick to you at stoplights.\n\nWhen you finally pull into the driveway, she parks and lets out a small sigh, stretching her arms over the steering wheel. \"Alright,\" she says, glancing over at you. \"I think I've officially hit my mall limit for the year.\"\n\nYou chuckle and unbuckle, bags rustling softly as you both collect your things.\n\nInside the house, it's calm, dim, and familiar. You set your bag down by the stairs, for a second, letting your arms rest when your mom pauses beside you. She doesn't say much, but she doesn't have to. She just reaches out and pulls you into a hug, warm and quiet, no big moment made of it.\n\n\"I love you,\" she says simply, her voice low and steady against your shoulder.\n\nYou nod, arms tightening just a little around her. \"Love you too.\"\n\nShe pulls back, gives you one last gentle look, and then disappears down the hallway without another word.\n\nYou gather your bags—soft plastic, warm fabric, a quiet bundle of choices—and carry them upstairs. Your room is dim, still waiting. You wrap your fingers around the doorknob and breathe in.\n\nThen push it open.\n\n[Choice: Back home]",

You shift in your seat, glance over at her, and try your best to sound casual.\n\n \"So... what did you wear in high school?\"\n\n Your mom lets out a small laugh, eyes still on the road. \"Oh wow. That's the question you're going with?\"\n\n You grin. \"What? I'm just trying to set the bar low before we start trying things on. I figured that if you tell me something horrifying, I'll feel better about whatever I end up in.\"\n\n She huffs a laugh through her nose, amused, and taps the steering wheel as she thinks. \"Alright. Picture this—late nineties. Butterfly clips, glitter everything, and super wide bootcut jeans. There were these tiny little tank tops with slogans written in rhinestones too.\"\n\n You blink. \"I don't think I can picture that. I'm physically rejecting the image.\"\n\n \"Oh, and don't forget platform flip-flops,\" she adds with a grin. \"The less practical the shoe, the more fashionable it was.\"\n\n You laugh, picturing her as a teenager wobbling through school with sparkly lettering on her chest and a denim jacket two sizes too small.\n\n \"I had this one jacket I absolutely loved,\" she says, her voice warming. \"Corduroy, cropped, and bright red. It made me feel like I was in charge of something, even when I wasn't.\"\n\n There's a beat of quiet as the car turns onto the main road, the mall just a few lights away now.\n\n \"Fashion was weird back then, but it was fun,\" she continues. \"It made you feel like you could decide who you were. Or at least pretend to be someone bolder for a day.\"\n\n You nod, the words landing far deeper than she probably meant for them to.\n\n \"Why?\" she asks after a moment, glancing at you. \"Thinking about rocking some glitter tank tops today?\"\n\n You snort. \"Only if they come with platform flip-flops. Gotta commit to the look.\"\n\n She laughs, and the sound is soft and easy, carried on the breeze drifting in through the window. Outside, the parking lot of the mall comes into view. Your mom pulls into a space near the front and puts the car in park.\n\n \"You nervous?\" she asks.\n\n You pause, then nod once. \"A little.\"\n\n She smiles gently. \"Me too. But we'll figure it out.\"\n\n And with that, she unbuckles her seatbelt, and the two of you step out.\n\n \n You glance out the window as the town's familiar streets glide past. The breeze through the cracked window lifts your hair a little. You shift slightly, resting your elbows on the armrest. \"Samantha and Luke were giving me crap at lunch today.\"\n\n \"Well, that sounds about right,\" she says, letting out a short laugh. \"What was today's theme? Emotional sabotage or casual mockery?\"\n\n \"A little bit of both,\" you say. \"They found out I haven't exactly been... rotating my wardrobe.\"\n\n She raises an eyebrow in amusement. \"You mean how you wear that white shirt and those cargo shorts like it's your superhero costume?\"\n\n \"Not you too,\" you whine.\n\n \"Hey, I've earned the right,\" she says back, grinning.\n\n \"Samantha offered to take me to the mall,\" you add. \"Like, to find me something new. Luke wanted to come too but he's got football practice.\"\n\n Your mom glances over, eyes warm. \"That's sweet of them. They've always looked out for you in their own... intense ways.\"\n\n \"Yeah, they are kind of relentless,\" you say, smiling. \"It's kind of nice, though. Even when Samantha's being brutal about my clothes.\"\n\n \"She's always been like that,\" your mom says fondly. \"Remember when you were eight and she told you your rain boots made you look like a lost farmer?\"\n\n You laugh despite yourself. \"She still brings that up sometimes, you know.\"\n\n Your mom smiles wider, her voice dipping into that nostalgic tone she uses when talking about the past. \"And Luke? That boy's been glued to your side since preschool. I remember he used to follow you around the playground like you were giving him secret missions.\"\n\n \"Yeah, now he just brings canned ham to school and calls it a personality.\"\n\n Your mom blinks. \"What?\"\n\n \"Don't ask.\"\n\n \"You're lucky,\" she says after a moment. \"Having people who know you that well and stick around is rare.\"\n\n You nod. You think of Luke's loud laugh and Samantha's withering stares, the way they never let you drift too far.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say softly. \"I know.\"\n\n The car turns onto the road leading toward the mall, and your mom slows into a parking space near the entrance.\n\n \"They'd be proud of you for doing this,\" she adds, voice steady. \"Even if they might not say it out loud.\"\n\n You offer a smile. \"Samantha would probably just say 'finally.'\"\n\n \"Which, in her language, is a proud moment.\"\n\n She's not wrong.\n\n You unbuckle your seatbelt, and look ahead—the mall entrance stands ahead, doors wide, the afternoon sun golden behind you. You head inside with your mom, with more to figure out and more still ahead. But for now, you're not alone.\n\n \n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n The wind rolls gently through the open car window as your mom drives. The road ahead is quiet and familiar—rows of chain stores and gas stations slowly giving way to the mall. You sit with your hands in your lap, fingers tapping idly against your thigh. You stare at your reflection faintly caught in the window—the curve of your face, the softness that wasn't there a month ago, the way your shirt doesn't quite fall the way it used to.\n\n You take a deep breath.\n\n \"Hey, Mom?\"\n\n She glances over. \"Yeah?\"\n\n You hesitate a beat. \"Did you ever... feel weird in your own body? Like you were supposed to feel one way about yourself, but... it didn't quite line up?\"\n\n She doesn't answer right away. Her hands stay steady on the wheel and her eyes fixed on the road. But you see the subtle shift in her expression—she heard you.\n\n Eventually, she exhales. \"Yeah. I think I did. Not in the same way, maybe, but... yeah. When I was your age, I think I spent a lot of time pretending I felt more confident in myself than I actually did. And sometimes, pretending turned into a habit. I'd look in the mirror and think, 'I'm supposed to like this,' but deep down, I didn't. I didn't feel like me. Not really.\"\n\n You nod slowly, your throat a little tight.\n\n \"It's confusing,\" she says. \"It's like there's this version of you that exists just beyond your reach, and you're trying to catch up to it, piece by piece.\"\n\n You turn back toward the window, swallowing. \"I've just been feeling... off. I don't know. I keep telling myself I'm still the same guy I've always been, but then I'll catch my reflection or notice something new, and it's like—\" You pause, trying to find the right words. \"Like I'm seeing someone else. Someone who's not wrong, just... not who I thought I was supposed to be.\"\n\n Your mom listens.\n\n \"It's so weird,\" you continue. \"Because it doesn't scare me, not exactly. Some of the changes actually feel... right. I don't know what that means or what I'm supposed to do with it.\"\n\n The words hang there for a moment, heavier than you expected.\n\n \"I've been trying to ignore it and push it down. Tell myself that it's a phase or that my brain's making it up. But it's not going away.\"\n\n Your mom nods slowly, her grip on the wheel steady.\n\n \"You know, when something in you starts shifting like that, it's usually for a reason,\" she says gently. \"Most people don't spend this much time thinking about who they are unless there's something real underneath it all. That doesn't mean you have to figure it all out tonight. It just means that you owe it to yourself to stop pretending.\"\n\n You nod, jaw tight.\n\n \"I just... I don't think I want to be who I thought I was anymore,\" you say. \"But I don't know who else to be.\"\n\n She's silent for a few seconds, then exhales slowly. \"Then let's find out. No pressure. No timeline. Just... try things. Try clothes. Try language. Try seeing what makes you feel like you. And if that changes? Well, that's okay too.\"\n\n You nod again.\n\n Outside the window, the mall comes into view. Your mom pulls into a spot and turns off the engine, the car going still.\n\n \"Look, [name], this doesn't have to be a big reveal,\" she says. \"It's just shopping. But if some part of you feels more like you by the time we leave... then that's something.\"\n\n You take a few deep breaths before finally opening the door and stepping out beside her.\n\n Maybe this isn't about changing. Maybe it's about finally listening.\n \n \n The road hums beneath the tire and the sun casts long lines across the dashboard as your mom turns down the familiar stretch that leads toward the mall. You pick at a loose thread on your top for a second before glancing over.\n\n \"Hey,\" you say, voice a little hesitant.\n\n Your mom glances at you. \"Yeah?\"\n\n You take a breath. \"Did you ever feel... I don't know. Like you didn't fit in your own skin? Like something about you just felt off, even if nothing was technically wrong?\"\n\n She's quiet for a beat—enough for you to start regretting asking.\n\n \"Yeah,\" she says. \"Yeah, I did.\"\n\n \"Really?\" you ask, blinking.\n\n She nods. \"When I was your age, I think I spent half my time pretending I was more comfortable than I actually was. Even if I wore the right clothes, said the right things, and hung out with the people who seemed right, there was always this weird distance between how I acted and how I felt.\"\n\n You look out the window, letting her words settle.\n\n \"I didn't know how to explain it,\" she continues. \"And I didn't know if I was just awkward, or weird, or trying too hard to be someone I wasn't. Sometimes it felt like everyone else had gotten a copy of the manual for how to be a normal person, and I didn't.\"\n\n You huff a laugh at that.\n\n \"But I grew into myself,\" she says, glancing over at you. \"Eventually. With help and time. You kind of collect pieces of yourself along the way, you know? You don't have to have all the answers now.\"\n\n You nod before the car falls into a comfortable silence again.\n\n She gives you a softer smile, one of those rare ones that she doesn't flash for anyone.\n\n \"You don't have to explain what you're feeling if you're not ready, [name],\" she adds. \"But you can if you want.\"\n\n You don't say anything right away. Not because you don't want to, but because you're still figuring it out—still sorting through that strange disconnect between the way things are and the way they feel.\n\n But knowing she gets it helps.\n\n The mall comes into view ahead and your mom pulls into a spot near the front. She puts the car in park and then looks over again, quieter this time. \"We'll just take it slow. Find something that feels good on you. That's all.\"\n\n You nod, unbuckling your seatbelt. \"Got it.\"\n\n You're not fully sure of what you're looking for, but more ready than you were before.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Shopping begin!]",

You walk beside your mom, and it's surprisingly not super crowded. Just enough people to make the space feel alive, not overwhelming.\n\nYour mom glances at a directory kiosk, then turns to you.\n\n\"Alright,\" she says, keeping her tone breezy but careful. \"I think we should start with something basic. Foundational.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"What does that mean?\"\n\nShe gives you a gentle but honest look. \"We should probably get you a bra first.\"\n\nThe words land softly but clearly. You feel your chest tighten just a little—not from panic, but from awareness.\n\n<<if [acceptance] > 19>> \n You pause for only a second.\n\n It's not a surprise. If anything, it was kind of inevitable.\n\n \"Yeah, that makes sense.\"\n\n Your mom offers a small smile, like she knows exactly how much effort that answer took. \"It doesn't have to be fancy,\" she says. \"Just something that fits. Something that makes you feel comfortable. That's all we're looking for, [name].\"\n\n \n You stop walking.\n\n \"A bra?\" you ask, half laughing. \"Is that really necessary?\"\n\n Your mom raises an eyebrow, the corners of her mouth pulled. \"I mean...

I'm not trying to be anything, Mom. I just—\"\n\n She cuts in gently. \"This isn't about being anything. It's about being comfortable. That's all. You don't have to label it.\"\n\n You stare at the tile floor for a moment, chewing the inside of your cheek. The resistance is still there, but it's not as sharp as it used to be. Just worn down.\n\n \"...Fine,\" you mutter. \"But it's just one. Nothing lacy.\"\n\n Your mom smiles. \"Deal.\"\n \n\nAs you and your mom near the store, the bright pink sign comes into view. There are sleek mannequins posed in window displays, lace and soft cotton, and the faint smell of perfume. You slow your steps just slightly, feet dragging in that unconscious way your body does when your brain's bracing for something unfamiliar.\n\nYour mom notices.

      "text": "<<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You hesitate for only a second, shifting your weight from one foot to the other, heart thudding with a nervous rhythm that feels... weirdly good.\n\n The store is just ahead and it should feel terrifying. A month ago, maybe even a week ago, it would've been.\n\n But now?\n\n Now your skin's buzzing with anticipation.\n\n \"I mean...\" you shrug, feigning disinterest. Your smile is creeping in anyway, tugging at the corners of your mouth before you can stop it. \"Just say I'm a girl. Easier that way.\"\n\n You glance at your mom—just briefly—and catch her watching you with the tiniest spark in her eyes. She knows. She sees the flush creeping up your neck and the way you twiddle your fingers. She doesn't say anything, opting to just give you a smile.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says. \"Let's get you fitted then.\"\n\n You swallow the grin threatening to spill over and nod like it's nothing.\n\n Your fingers twitch at your sides as you follow her, stepping into the softly lit store that feels less like enemy territory and more like something else.\n\n Your cheeks are warm. Your heart is loud. But you don't look back.\n \n \n You shift your weight, eyes fixed on the floor just past your mom's shoes. Your throat feels tight, like there's something stuck halfway up it. Words, maybe, or pressure.\n\n You don't want to be here. Not really. Not in this store. Not in this body that keeps changing no matter how hard you try to pretend it's not. The bra part? Fine. You'll deal with it. But the idea of saying you're a guy who needs one—of hearing someone else respond to that—makes your stomach twist.\n\n You let out a breath, eyes still down.\n\n \"...Just say I'm a girl,\" you mutter.\n\n Your mom doesn't react right away, but it's clear she's not buying it.\n\n \"Okay,\" she says finally. \"If that's what you want.\"\n\n You nod, but the motion feels hollow. You don't want it, exactly. It's just easier. Something to put between you and the awkward stares or the confused looks or the polite questions with too much kindness behind them. You're not here to make a statement.\n\n \"Let's just get in and out,\" you add.\n\n Your mom gives a soft hum of understanding, and the two of you move forward again, stepping toward the open glass doors and the soft hum of pop music playing just inside. You don't look up as you cross the threshold, pretending this is just another store. Another task.\n\n But it's not.\n \n\n \n \n \n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You stand outside of the store, the soft glow of its display lights casting across the tile. Your mom's voice still seems to linger in the air. The question she asked sinks into your chest. You glance down at your hands, fingers fidgeting with the hem of your sleeve, then up at the storefront again. Lace and cotton and soft colors. Everything you're not supposed to want.\n\n But you do. Or at least... you think you do.\n\n You've stopped pretending the changes don't matter. The way your reflection sometimes feels like it's catching up to something you've never said out loud.\n\n You bite the inside of your cheek, then look at your mom.\n\n \"Tell them the truth, I guess,\" you say. \"I'm a guy. A guy who just... happens to need a bra.\"\n\n She doesn't blink, flinch or question.\n\n \"Got it,\" she says, nodding.\n\n You stand a little straighter.\n\n It still feels scary—walking into a space not really built for you. But it also feels honest. You're taking a step toward something that's been waiting for you.\n\n The two of you cross the threshold together, the soft scent of perfume filling your nose.\n\n This is it.\n \n \n You stare at the floor tiles past your feet, your shoulders tensing under your top. The question lingers in the air like a held breath. You feel the heat rise in your neck, not from embarrassment, exactly, but from something murkier—resentment, maybe. The way your body's been shifting lately hasn't been subtle, and ignoring it stopped working a while ago. But saying it out loud still feels like rubbing salt on the wound.\n\n You take a breath through your nose and let it out slowly.\n\n \"Just tell them the truth,\" you mutter. \"I'm a guy.\"\n\n Your mom nods.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says. \"That's what I'll do.\"\n\n You appreciate that she doesn't make it into a moment. No hand on your shoulder or reaffirming words, just a quiet respect. That's exactly what you need right now.\n\n The two of you approach the storefront together. You swallow, straighten your back, and step through the entrance.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "The air immediately shifts as you step into the store. It's tinged with floral perfume and faint traces of vanilla. The lighting is warm, almost cozy, and everything about the space feels deliberately gentle—like even the design is trying to put you at ease.\n\nLacy displays line the front, pastel bras folded and hung in precise rows. A few mannequins stand off to the side wearing matching sets like they know exactly what they're doing here. You shift a little closer to your mom, who places a reassuring hand between your shoulder blades, steering you further in with a calmness that helps more than you'd admit.\n\nA store associate—probably late twenties, with sleek hair in a low bun and a name tag that says Riley—spots you from behind the counter and walks over with a practiced smile.\n\n\"Hi there,\" she says, her tone friendly and professional. \"Can I help you find anything today?\"\n\n \n Your mom steps forward just slightly, keeping her voice light. \"Yeah, actually. This is my daughter and she hasn't had a proper fitting yet. I figured it was time, I don't know how we hadn't already gotten around to it.\"\n\n You feel your stomach tighten for a second, but Riley just nods with a smile that doesn't flicker.\n\n \"Of course,\" she says, like it's the most normal thing in the world. \"We can absolutely help with that.\"\n\n \n Your mom steps forward, her voice steady and casual. \"This is my son and he's looking to get fitted for a bra. First time, and... well, we figured it was time to stop guessing.\"\n\n For a half-second, something tightens in your chest. You brace for a reaction, some kind of flicker in Riley's expression—a double take, confusion, anything.\n\n But she doesn't even blink.\n\n \"Got it,\" she says smoothly, her smile just as warm and unfazed. \"We can definitely help with that.\"\n\n No weird looks. No awkward pause. Just acceptance, like this is exactly as normal as it should be. You let out a sigh of relief.\n \n\nShe gestures toward a hallway in the back, where the fitting rooms are.\n\n\"If you'd like, we can do a fitting back here,\" Riley says. \"It's simple—just measurements, no pressure to buy anything if you're not ready. We'll find something comfortable and supportive. You can follow me when you're ready.\"\n\nYou glance at the hallway, then at Riley, then at your mom.\n\n[Choice: Ask your mom to come with you]\n[Choice: Tell your mom you'll go in by yourself]",

      "text": "You look ahead at the softly lit hallway leading to the fitting rooms, your heart picking up pace again. The idea of walking back there alone, of stripping layers in front of a stranger, makes your chest feel tight in a way that has nothing to do with clothes.\n\n You turn to your mom, voice quiet. \"Can you.. come with me?\"\n\n Her eyes soften instantly, and she nods without hesitation. \"Of course.\"\n\n You follow Riley through the hallway, past racks of soft bralettes and lounge sets. She stops in front of a small room with a plush bench, mirror, and a tiny hook on the wall. \"I'll step out and grab a measuring tape,\" she says. \"Just take your time getting ready.\"\n\n She closes the door behind her with a soft click, and you and your mom are left in the small, warmly lit space. She gives you room—just enough—but she's there.\n\n \n \n You tug your top off slowly, already dreading the part where you'll have to explain. The binder is snug against your skin, a gift from Coach Blake. It compresses well enough, but you've had it for a while now, and your ribs have definitely noticed.\n\n Your mom watches you carefully. She doesn't comment at first, which you're grateful for.\n\n After a moment, she says softly, \"Is that... comfortable?\"\n\n You don't look at her as you shrug. \"Not really, but it does work.\"\n\n She nods, not pushing. \"While I am proud of you for being honest, let's find something that doesn't hurt. Something that supports you, not just flattens.\"\n\n You keep your eyes on the mirror, jaw tight. The binder has been armor for so long, you almost forgot it wasn't supposed to hurt.\n \n \n You take a deep breath and pull off your top, revealing the folded towel you've wrapped around your chest—looped and knotted under your shirt like the improvised, desperate solution it is. It's tight. Too tight. Your ribs ache from it. You didn't want to wear it, but your other options didn't feel safe either.\n\n Your mom's expression flickers—just for a second—but she hides it quickly behind calm concern.\n\n She steps a little closer, voice low. \"Sweetheart... how long have you been doing that?\"\n\n You grimace, adjusting the knot. \"For a while now. I didn't want anyone to notice.\"\n\n Her hand hovers, then gently rests on your shoulder. \"Okay. First, we are not doing this anymore. You don't have to. We'll find something that fits. Something real. And you don't ever have to hurt yourself just to feel safe, okay?\"\n\n You nod. She doesn't press.\n\n A pressure in your chest lifts, figuratively and literally.\n \n \n \n \n You pull off your top and glance at the mirror. For a second, you almost expect to see something different something more—but your chest is still flat. Completely. No curves, no weight, nothing to hide or support.\n\n Your mom peeks over and gives a small, thoughtful nod. \"Still flat, huh?\"\n\n You shrug. \"Yeah. Nothing's really changed there.\"\n\n \"That's okay,\" your mom says, smiling gently. \"Still good to have something.\"\n\n You nod.\n \n \n You peel off your top, tugging it over your head, and adjust the hem of your plain sports bra underneath. It's one you got as a gift, and it doesn't really flatten or support much.\n\n Your mom glances over and gives a soft, approving nod. \"That's not a bad one. Has it been comfortable?\"\n\n You shrug, adjusting the strap on your shoulder. \"Mostly.\"\n\n She smiles. \"Well, we'll find something better. Something that doesn't just squish everything down.\"\n \n \n You slowly pull your top over your head, heart beating faster than it should as you feel your skin meet the air. No binder. No bra. Just you, completely exposed in front of your mom.\n\n Your chest has changed. You've known that for a while now. The shape, the weight, the way shirts fit lately—it's been slowly becoming something you can't ignore.\n\n Your mom watches you with that same gentleness. \"Thanks for letting me come in with you,\" she says quietly, like she knows you're fighting through a wave of complicated feelings.\n\n You nod once, arms automatically crossing over your chest. \"I just... didn't want to explain anything to a stranger.\"\n\n \"You don't have to,\" she says. \"We're just here to find what feels right.\"\n\n You slowly uncross your arms. You're not ready, but you are trying.\n \n \n There's a gentle knock at the fitting room door.\n\n \"Hey, it's Riley,\" comes her calm voice. \"Ready for me to come in for the fitting?\"\n\n You swallow, barely managing a quiet, \"Yeah.\"\n\n Riley steps into the fitting room with practiced ease, a measuring tape in her hands. She glances at both you and your mom, then gestures lightly. \"We'll just do a quick measurement. No pressure to commit to anything—this is just to get a baseline so we can find what feels right, okay?\"\n\n You nod, heart fluttering slightly, even if you try not to show it. Your mom steps back to give you two space, and Riley gently motions for your arms to lift a little.\n\n \"Arms relaxed. Just let me guide the tape—should only take a few seconds.\"\n\n You breathe in quietly, and she gets to work.\n\n \n The moment the tape wraps around the fullest part of your chest, you feel your face flush. You know you've changed—your shirt's been fitting differently for ages—but having someone measure it makes it feel official. Like proof.\n\n Riley doesn't react at all, simply checking the tape, adjusting the band level beneath your chest, and recording the numbers like it's no different than measuring your shoe size.\n\n She steps back with a small smile. \"You're measuring at a 36B.\"\n\n You blink. You hadn't expected them to be that... solid.\n\n \"That puts you in the medium-support range,\" she explains. \"You've got enough natural shape that you'll probably feel best in lightly structured cups. We can do soft underwire, or go wireless with shaping seams. I'll grab a few styles with a smooth finish. Trust me, you'll definitely notice the difference in comfort.\"\n\n \"Yeah. Let's try,\" you say.\n\n Riley nods and excuses herself to grab a few starter styles, leaving you and your mom in the soft quiet of the fitting room.\n \n \n The measuring tape brushes across your chest and it's... undeniable now. There's something there. Not huge or obvious, but it's real. The soft curve of your chest presses just enough into the tape that you feel the shift in numbers as Riley gently notes them.\n\n She doesn't blink. Doesn't hesitate. Her movements are calm and routine.\n\n \"Okay,\" she says after a few seconds. \"You're measuring at a 34A.\"\n\n Your heart skips a beat. You expected the A, maybe, but didn't expect to hear it said out loud like that.\n\n \"That means you've got a light cup size, but enough to benefit from a bit of support,\" she continues, unfazed. \"We'll start with soft cup bras—ones that offer lift and shape without any stiffness. There's no bulk or weird padding, just something to make you feel secure.\"\n\n Your mom nods thoughtfully beside you. \"That sounds perfect.\"\n\n \"Okay,\" you say, nodding. \"Thanks.\"\n \n \n Riley places the tape snugly under your chest first, reading the band size with a quick flick of her eyes. Then she shifts it higher, across where the breast tissue would be, but there's nothing there. She finishes the measurement without hesitation, jotting something down on the corner of her notepad.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says with a smile, standing straight. \"You're measuring at a 32AA. That means you're in the ultra-light support category. Nothing with underwire unless you want it—some soft bralettes or compression-friendly options will probably feel best.\"\n\n You nod slowly.\n \n\n \n You glance toward the softly lit hallway leading to the fitting rooms. Going there alone and having your chest measured by a stranger is nerve-wracking, sure, but not impossible.\n\n \"I've got this,\" you murmur.\n\n She hesitates, then nods. \"Alright. I'll be right here if you need me.\"\n\n You give her a quick, almost sheepish smile, then follow the hallway alone. The fitting rooms are warm and softly lit, with pale pink walls and a plush bench. As you step inside and close the door behind you, the quiet settles in.\n\n Now it's just you and the mirror.\n\n \n \n You pull your top off slowly, already feeling the pressure from the tight, black binder beneath it. It clings to your chest, compressing everything into place like armor. It's familiar, and you've been relying on it for a while now. It works for the most part.\n\n But standing under this soft lighting, in this space that's supposed to be about fit and comfort, the way the binder presses into your ribs, suddenly feeling too sharp. Too restrictive. You twist side to side, stretching a little, wincing as the fabric digs in.\n\n You catch your reflection in the mirror. The binder gives you shape, or rather, takes shape away. But it also takes ease with it.\n\n You don't hate it, but you're not sure if you want to keep wearing something that hurts to feel okay.\n \n \n You tug your hoodie over your head slowly, wincing as the rough knot of fabric digs into your ribs. The towel you've wrapped around your chest is tight—too tight—but it's the only thing you have.\n\n As you undo the makeshift binding, the pressure lifts suddenly, leaving behind a dull ache and a faint red mark.\n\n You look at yourself in the mirror and feel both exposed and strangely relieved. The towel was always a temporary solution. You knew that. It was never meant to last, it was just supposed to get you here.\n \n \n \n \n Your shirt comes off easily, the fabric light over your still-flat chest. There's no curve to hide. Your torso is smooth and angular, the way it's always been, even as everything else seems to keep shifting around you.\n\n You glance at your reflection, expecting to feel small. But you don't. Not quite.\n\n You don't need a bra for support, at least not yet. But you're here anyway, and it never hurts to get one just in case.\n \n \n You lift your top and tug it off in one smooth motion, revealing the snug band of your sports bra underneath. It's plain, and was a gift from someone who thought you'd need it. It does the job, pressing down just enough that you don't think about it too much during the day.\n\n You glance at the mirror and run your fingers under the band. It's not uncomfortable, but it's not great either. It's... functional. But you want comfortable.\n \n \n You pull your shirt over your head slowly, revealing your bare chest underneath. You don't have a bra, or a binder, or anything. Your breasts are soft and visible, a quiet presence that's been increasingly harder to ignore.\n\n You came here for a reason. To stop pretending this isn't happening and to be comfortable. Maybe it's time to stop pretending that real is something to be afraid of.\n \n \n \n There's a gentle knock at the fitting room door.\n\n \"Hey, it's Riley,\" comes her calm voice. \"Ready for me to come in for the fitting?\"\n\n You swallow, barely managing a quiet, \"Yeah.\"\n\n The door opens and Riley steps inside with a soft smile and a flexible measuring tape looped around her neck. She closes the door gently behind her, moving with a practiced confidence. It's clear she's done this a thousand times and isn't about to make it weird.\n\n \"No stress,\" she says lightly. \"It'll just be two quick measurements—should only take a second. Relax your arms for me?\"\n\n You nod and stand a little straighter, heart fluttering just beneath your skin.\n\n \n Riley starts with the band measurement—firm but gentle as she wraps the tape beneath your chest. Then she moves upward, looping it carefully around the fullest part of your chest.\n\n You feel the heat in your cheeks rise. There is definitely no hiding the size now.\n\n Riley finishes and pulls back with a nod.\n\n \"You're measuring at a 36B,\" she says. \"That means you'll probably want medium support—something with shaping, maybe a soft underwire. But there's no pressure to go structured unless you want it.\"\n\n You blink. \"B?\" you repeat in a whisper.\n\n \"Yep,\" she says, unfazed. \"That's totally normal. You don't have to hide anything, but you don't have to show anything either. Just choose what feels right to you.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you murmur. \"That... helps.\"\n \n \n Riley wraps the measuring tape beneath your chest first, the soft edge resting against your ribs. She calls out the band size, then moves it upward, gently looping it across the curve of your chest. There's just enough pressure to feel, not enough to squeeze.\n\n You can't help noticing how much more there is than there used to be.\n\n She just reads the number, pulls back, and smiles.\n\n \"You're a 34A,\" she says. \"Which means you've got some shape but you're still in the lighter support zone. I'll bring you soft cups, maybe one with some lining if you're curious about it.\"\n\n You nod, arms hovering awkwardly at your sides.\n\n \"You've got options here,\" she adds. \"You don't have to hide anything, but you don't have to show anything either. Just choose what feels right to you.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you murmur. \"That... helps.\"\n \n \n Riley steps in front of you and wraps the measuring tape around your ribcage, right beneath your chest. It settles there without any resistance—just skin and bone, no curve to measure. She calls out a quiet number under her breath before shifting the tape upward across the flattest part of your chest.\n \n \"Alright,\" she says, straightening. \"You're measuring around a 32AA. That puts you in a flat-fit or soft bralette category. Just something comfortable and light.\"\n\n You nod, exhaling slowly.\n \n \n\n[Choice: See your options]",

She hands you a neat little stack of bras, each on a padded hanger, her smile warm but never too much.\n\n\"I got three basics and one that's a little more fun, if you're up for it.\"\n\nYou nod, murmuring a quiet thank you as she vanishes down the hall again.\n\nYou hang the bras one by one on the hook. They sway slightly, catching the light.\n\nYou run your fingers over the first one—white, smooth, and soft. Simple. It feels like the safe option. The kind you could wear without thinking or announcing anything. Just... functional.\n\nNext is a lavender one. Something about the color makes your breath hitch slightly. It's soft too, but a little more delicate, a little more expressive. It feels like something someone picked for themselves, not just to hide in.\n\nThe third is black. Sleek. Minimalist. There's something about it that feels... grounded. Like it belongs to someone who already knows what they want, who they are. You don't know if that's you yet, but it tugs at something in your chest.\n\nAnd then there's the last one—lacy black, floral stitching curling across the cups.

Just a clean, gentle garment that feels safe.\n\n You turn it over in your hands, feeling its lightness, the subtle elasticity in the band. It doesn't ask much of you. It doesn't demand you know who you are or how you want to be seen. It just exists. It's just neutral.\n\n You slip it on slowly and carefully. It hugs your chest like a whisper—present, but barely. Looking at yourself in the window, you almost don't look different. But you feel different.\n\n Your mom doesn't say anything, but she does give you a smile.\n\n You did enough for today.\n \n \n \n You hesitate the longest in front of the black one. It's the kind of bra that feels serious, like it belongs to someone confident. You take it off the hook, heart pounding a little, and slowly ease it on.\n\n It fits like a second skin—firm but not tight, clean lines, no lace or color to distract. In the mirror, you look sharper. Like someone who made a decision instead of getting swept into one.\n\n You breathe out, and it feels like the first full breath you've taken in a while.\n\n Your mom tilts her head, looking at you. \"You look... grounded.\"\n\n You nod.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"I guess that's kind of the point.\"\n \n \n \n You reach for the lavender bra, hesitating for a second before lifting it from the hook. It feels light in your hands, the pale purple fabric catching the light.\n\n It's a small thing, but it does feels like a choice.\n\n You try it on, adjusting the straps slowly. It fits snugly, securely. You glance at yourself in the mirror, and it's still you, just with color.\n\n Your mom sees your expression and doesn't say anything for a moment. Then, quietly, \"It suits you.\"\n\n You nod, and though your voice barely comes out, it's steady.\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n \"Yeah, I think so too.\"\n \n \n \"I guess, yeah.\"\n \n \n \n \n Your fingers hover over the lacy one for a full ten seconds before you finally take it down. It's delicate. Intricate. The floral patterns are stitched in black thread, the material a little sheer. It's pretty. You're not quite sure why you chose it, only that part of you needs to.\n\n You slip it on slowly, and it feels softer than it should. In that bra, it doesn't look like you're hiding, it looks like you're being.\n\n Your mom doesn't say anything at first. She watches you for a long moment before her expression softens.\n\n \"Beautiful,\" she comments, nodding.\n\n You don't respond right away. You just stare at the mirror, eyes wide, chest rising and falling steadily.\n\n \"...Yeah,\" you whisper.\n \n\n \n \n \n You reach for the white bra.\n\n It's the most neutral of the bunch—plain, seamless, and soft. The kind of thing you could wear and forget it's even there. No color to read into or message to send, it's just... safe. And safe feels okay right now.\n\n You unclip it and slip it on, the band fitting snugly around your ribs. It's gentle. Light. Not restrictive, just present. You glance at your reflection in the mirror and realize your body feels a little more comfortable, like it finally has permission to settle.\n\n There's no dramatic revelation or swelling music, just a soft kind of rightness.\n\n You breathe out and roll your shoulders. This, you can handle.\n \n \n \n Your fingers hover, then curl around the sleek black one. There's something about it—minimal, structured, and just a little bold. You're not sure what exactly draws you to it, but you want it.\n\n You try it on.\n\n The fabric hugs your chest firmly, but not uncomfortably. The straps feel solid. Supportive. You look at yourself in the mirror and for a second, you seem more grounded.\n\n There's a small shift in your spine, a straighter posture, and a breath that comes easier.\n\n You didn't expect this, but here you are.\n \n \n \n You hesitate over the lavender one.\n\n It's soft. Delicate, but not girly. Calm. You hold it up and it feels like something chosen—not just worn. Almost like it's for you.\n\n You slip it on.\n\n It fits perfectly—gentle and stretchy, not too tight, not too loose. The color is subtle, but undeniably there. You look in the mirror, expecting to feel awkward. But instead, you feel something close to warmth.\n\n It's not about standing out, it's about softening into yourself.\n \n \n \n Your eyes land on the lacy one.\n\n It's delicate. Floral-patterned. Slightly sheer. Something about it feels like stepping off a ledge and trusting the ground will rise up to catch you. You're not even sure why the hell you reach for it.\n\n Maybe it's because it scares you a little. Or maybe because it doesn't.\n\n You slip it on slowly. The lace settles across your chest. You face the mirror, expecting to feel ridiculous. But you don't.\n\n You actually, somehow, feel pretty.\n\n For a moment, you stop bracing against yourself. You just exist.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Bra shopping begone!]",

It's strange how such a small thing can feel like a milestone. Like a line you didn't know you were ready to cross until you were already standing on the other side of it.\n\nYour mom smiles at you—warm, proud, but not overdoing it. She knows better than to make this moment bigger than you're ready for.\n\n\"That's the one?\" she asks.\n\n\"Yeah,\" you reply, nodding.\n\nShe takes it from you with a gentle hand and heads to the counter while you hang back. Riley is already there waiting, hands resting on the counter. She doesn't ask questions or give any weird looks, just rings it up with a practiced ease.\n\nYour mom pays without hesitation.\n\n\"I appreciate your help,\" she tells Riley.\n\n\"Of course,\" Riley replies with a sincere smile. She then turns to you. \"You made a great choice. First times can feel weird, I know, but you handled it really well.\"\n\nYou shift slightly, not quite sure what to do with the compliment. \"Thanks,\" you manage.\n\n\"Take your time figuring out what fits,\" she adds. \"Not just the size, but everything. You'll know when something's right.\"\n\nYou nod again, eyes lowering slightly. There's something soft in your chest, something that almost feels like relief.\n\nYour mom takes the bag, and you both turn to head out. The bell above the door chimes as you step into the mall again.\n\nThe world feels a little brighter than when you first walked in.\n\n[Choice: Bra acquired]",

Curated.\n\nThe lighting is soft and diffused, bouncing off racks of lightweight jackets, breezy skirts, and wide-leg trousers. Your mom trails in just behind you. \"This is actually kind of cute,\" she says, looking around the store.\n\nYou nod, slowly taking it in. The music exiting the speakers is upbeat bubblegum pop, and a few other teens mill around. One side of the store has shelves of accessories that make you pause.\n\nYour mom follows your gaze and points. \"That corner looks fun. Want to start there? It's up to you, we do have plenty of time.\"\n\nThe store isn't loud. It's feminine, sure, but in a subtle way. It's giving you space.

Little choices.\n\n \"I'll check that section out,\" you murmur, and your mom gives a small nod, following without comment.\n\n The two of you approach the display together, side by side. There's something weirdly comforting about that—like you're not totally alone.\n\n Your mom immediately gravitates toward a small rack of hair accessories and lets out a soft, amused breath. \"Wow. Okay. These look nice.\"\n\n You glance over and see her turning over a set of smooth, pastel hairpins in her fingers—three shades: red, lavender, and white. She tapes the red one against her own hair, squinting at her reflection in the display mirror.\n\n \"Huh. I actually like the red,\" she says, half to herself. \"Though I'd probably just lose it in the bottom of my purse within a week.\"\n\n You smile faintly, then turn your attention to the little container of hair ties next to her. Four types sit coiled like soft spirals:\n\n <ul> \n <li>A plain elastic</li>\n <li>A simple ribbon</li>\n <li>A bunny ears ribbon</li>\n <li>A scrunchie</li>\n </ul> \n\n \n Your mom picks up the bunny-ear ribbon with a small, knowing smile. \"Looks familiar, don't you think?\"\n\n You glance up, instinctively touching the one already tied in your hair. \"What can I say? It's iconic.\"\n\n \"Bold,\" she agrees, setting it back down with care. \"But it works on you.\"\n\n She doesn't press it. Just lets you keep browsing, like the quiet approval is enough.\n \n \n Your mom lifts the bunny-ears tie with a tiny smile. \"This one's definitely a personality.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath. \"Is it a bit much?\"\n\n \"Not necessarily,\" she says, still looking at it. \"But it does say something. Might be fun, though. If you wanted to say it.\"\n\n She doesn't ask if you do. She just sets it gently back into the bin and lets you browse.\n \n\n You pick up the lavender pin, running your thumb across its smooth curve. It's small, barely the size of a matchstick, but it gleams under the soft store lights. It's small and quiet, but still... there.\n\n Your mom watches you for a beat, then glances at the display again.\n\n \"No wrong answer,\" she murmurs.\n\n And for once, it really doesn't feel like there is one.\n\n [Choice: Try some accessories on]\n\n \n \n \n You linger near the front display for a few more moments, your eyes catching a few cute accessories. They do look cute, and they do feel like it could be something. But the longer you stand there, the more your shoulders tighten. It's not that anything's wrong. No one's staring. The music's calm, your mom's not pressuring you, the store staff are minding their business.\n\n And still, it feels like you're standing in a room built for someone who already knows who they are. Like the clothes and the accessories are all speaking a language you're not fluent in.\n\n You swallow, glance at your mom, and say it softly: \"I think... I don't want to shop here. Not today.\"\n\n She looks up from the scarves she was absently thumbing through and immediately sets them back on the rack. \"Alright.\"\n\n You blink, almost surprised by how quickly she responds.\n\n She offers you a small, easy smile and adjusts the strap of her handbag. \"You don't have to explain it,\" she says, stepping beside you. \"Not everything has to click all at once.\"\n\n You nod, eyes dropping to the floor. \"I just thought maybe... I don't know.\"\n\n \"Look, [name], I get it,\" she replies, rubbing your back lightly. \"Some places look right until you're standing in the middle of them.\"\n\n You crack a faint smile at that. \"Yeah. Pretty much.\"\n\n She tilts her head toward the entrance. \"Wanna find somewhere else?\"\n\n You glance once more at the shelves of accessories and then back toward the open mall walkway. You don't feel any regret, though—if anything, it's a relief. Like knowing when to take a breath and move on.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"Let's go.\"\n\n And without a second thought, your mom walks beside you as you step back into the flow of the mall.\n\n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

When Maya hands you the bag, her voice lowers just slightly. \"Come back anytime, okay? We always get new stuff.

She doesn't say anything right away, but you can tell she's waiting—offering an opening if you want to talk.\n\n You don't take it. Not yet.

The fitting room is quiet, dimmed in a way that makes everything feel gentler—like it was designed for someone who needed the world to hush for a second.\n\n You glance down at what you're about to try on, resting neatly on the bench: a white tank top, an oversized sweater, a cute blue skirt—and a few other things that make your heart race.\n\n You sit for a moment, your hand resting on the sweater, feeling the hum of anticipation in your chest. Then, slowly, you begin to change. The tank top slides on easily, snug but not clingy. The sweater settles around your shoulders like it already knew where to fall, draping just slightly off to one side. And when you step into the skirt, you don't even flinch.\n\n You turn toward the mirror, and for a heartbeat, you freeze.\n\n Not from discomfort, but rather wonder. Because the person looking back at you isn't someone else. It's you. But clearer. Softer around the edges, Like the static finally tuned out, and you got to hear the melody underneath.\n\n You blink slowly, and do a little spin—just enough to make the skirt flutter—and then laugh, surprised at yourself. It comes out light. Real.\n\n Your hands brush the hem. You smooth the front, then let it wrinkle again, then smooth it out once more. Not because you're unsure, but because you like the feeling of it.\n\n You feel, dare you say it, beautiful.\n\n You're not sure you've ever used that word about yourself. Not even jokingly. But it fits here, in this small mirror-lit moment, like it's always been waiting.\n\n There's a gentle knock on the door.\n \n \"You doing okay in there?\" your mom asks, soft and curious.\n\n You pause, smile at the mirror, and answer without thinking. \"Yeah. I'm... really good.\"\n\n There's a pause. You imagine her smile on the other side.\n\n You take one more minute—one more glance at yourself. You hold that little moment as tightly as you can, imprinting it into your soul like a pressed flower between pages.\n\n Then, carefully, you begin to change back. You fold the clothes gently, smoothing the fabric like it deserves your thanks. You step out of the fitting room, clothes folded in your arms, and Maya looks up from behind a rack. Her expression brightens, but it's not performative. Just... pleased. She can tell.\n\n Your mom is already standing nearby. She gives you one quick glance—just one—and her face softens instantly.\n\n \"Well,\" she says, \"that look must've felt good.\"\n\n You nod. You're not grinning, but your cheeks are warm and your heart feels full in a way you can't explain.\n\n \"It did, Mom,\" you say. \"Like... really good.\"\n\n Your mom doesn't make a fuss. She doesn't say anything grand. She just touches your shoulder and gives it a light squeeze—the kind that says \"I see you,\" and \"I'm proud of you,\" and \"you're allowed to feel that way\" all at once.\n\n And standing here, holding those clothes, you do.\n\n \n You close the fitting room door behind you with a soft click, the gentle background hum of Blink + Shine's pop playlist muffled by the door.\n\n The clothes rest on the little bench beside you. They should be unthreatening, but even as you pull the first piece on, you can already feel it creeping in. The sensation of stepping into something that doesn't quite belong to you.\n\n You turn to the mirror as the fabric settles on your shoulder, and your stomach sinks a little.\n\n You don't look bad. The clothes technically fit. The cut is fine, the colors don't clash, and the sizing is pretty comfortable.\n\n But the person in the mirror? You don't know him.\n\n It's not a horror story and you're not disgusted or furious. But you feel this slow, sinking awkwardness pooling in your chest. You tilt your chin, stand up a little straighter, and even cross your arms in the hope that maybe if it hangs just right, it'll click.\n\n But every move feels forced.\n\n You try on another piece. A skirt this time. You tug it up carefully, smoothing it down and stepping back from the mirror. Still no shift. Just... the same dull thought floating around in your head like fog:\n\n \"What am I even doing?\"\n\n You press your lips together and blink. There's no anger. No shame. Just a kind of tired disappointment. You wanted to try and you did, but that doesn't mean it worked.\n\n You take off the clothes carefully, fold them back the way you found them, and place them on the bench. When you pull your regular top over your head—neutral, plain, familiar—you feel your shoulders settle. Not because it feels perfect, but because it feels like yours.\n\n You open the door quietly and step out.\n\n Your mom looks up from where she's seated, her phone resting in her lap. She offers a warm expression, but doesn't ask how it went. She doesn't have to.\n\n Maya glances over from where she's rearranging a rack of scarves. Her eyes flick to the clothes in your hands, and for just a second, you think she's going to ask. But she doesn't. She just smiles, small and neutral. \"Everything fit okay?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, because technically it did.\n\n She nods. \"Cool. Let me know if you need help checking anything out.\"\n\n It felt strange, like none of you was in there. But maybe, just maybe, that doesn't mean you have to walk away empty-handed.\n \n\n[Choice: Time to purchase]",

Like the world itself has lowered its volume a little. The walls are painted with soft, looping clouds and stars that look hand-drawn, glowing faintly under the light. Shelves rise in curved rows, each one packed with plushies of every shape and size. You don't even know where the hell to look first.\n\nYour mom follows you in, a little slower, her purse slung across her shoulder. You catch her eyes widening slightly at the sheer number of plushies. She lifts an eyebrow and looks over at you, saying, \"Wow. This place is kind of amazing.\"\n\nYou nod. \"Yeah, it's really nice.\"\n\nShe picks up a tiny axolotl plush that fits in her palm and turns it in her hands. \"Okay, serious question,\" she says, glancing up at you with a little smile. \"Do you still like these? I mean, you are eighteen now. And I'm not saying that means you're too old or anything, but...\"\n\nHer tone is gentle—genuinely curious, not teasing.\n\n\"I still do,\" you admit. \"I don't know how to describe it, exactly. It's just comforting. I don't have to explain anything to a stuffed animal. They just kind of exist.\"\n\nYour mom smiles more fully now, the lines at the corners of her eyes crinkling. She puts the axolotl back and nods. \"That makes a lot of sense. You were always the kind of kid who held onto things for way too long. Stuffed animals, drawings, even weird rocks you found in the yard. I think I kind of love that about you, [name].\"\n\nYou give a quiet laugh and rub the back of your neck. \"I guess that hasn't changed.\"\n\n\"It's not a bad thing, you know,\" your mom states. She lifts a caterpillar plush and hugs it once. \"It's kind of nice, seeing you let yourself like something.\"\n\nHer voice lowers just a little.\n\n\"It really does feel like I'm learning more about who you are today. And I like that. I really do.\"\n\nYou don't say anything at first, but your heart tugs a bit.\n\n\"Thanks, Mom,\" you say, and you mean it.\n\nYou turn toward a low display of plushies shaped like loaves of bread—each with little sleepy faces embroidered into the crust. Your mom trails behind you, still scanning the shelves, clearly more amused than she expected to be.\n\n\"So, what's the plan?\" she asks. \"Are you looking for someone small for your desk, or are we going full emotional-support burrito?\"\n\n[Choice: Point out a plushie you used to have as a kid]\n[Choice: Ask your Mom what plushie she would want]\n[Choice: Admit you prefer smaller plushies]\n[Choice: Admit you prefer larger plushies]",

      "text": "You trail your fingers along the edge of a display labeled \"Classics Reimagined,\" but your mind isn't on the little cardboard sign or the tiered shelves. Your eyes catch on a plushie tucked near the back of the row—half-buried behind some newer, trendier animals with oversized eyes and pastel fur.\n\n It's a stuffed turtle—a simple green shell, wide stitched smile, slightly floppy limbs. There's nothing flashy about it, but something about the shape and the way the seams curve—\n\n Your chest catches.\n\n \"Wait a second,\" you say quietly, leaning down and picking it up. \"No way.\"\n\n You turn it over in your hands, staring. It's not exactly the same, but it is close. Close enough that something deep in your memory stirs. You hold it up and turn toward your mom.\n\n \"Mom, do you remember this guy?\"\n\n She leans in, squinting. For a second, she doesn't seem to recognize it. Then her eyes widen.\n\n \"Oh my God,\" she breathes. \"The turtle. From preschool. You carried that thing everywhere you went.\"\n\n You smile, not even trying to hide it. \"I think I named him... Swimmy? Or... no, wait—Squirt.\"\n\n \"Squirt!\" she laughs. \"Yes! And you used to tuck him under your arm like he was your sidekick. You even brought him to the grocery store for, like, three years straight.\"\n\n You turn the plush around again, a weird warmth rising in your throat.\n\n \"I thought he got lost,\" you murmur. \"I looked for him in the toy bin for weeks.\"\n\n Your mom's face softens. \"I think he did get lost, now that I think about it. On a trip to your Aunt's place. You were so upset we let you sleep in our bed for a week.\"\n\n You chuckle quietly. \"That sounds about right, yeah.\"\n\n There's a beat of silence as you stand there with the turtle in your hands, its head tilted to one side like it's listening in.\n\n Your mom watches you, her gaze a little more serious now, but still gentle. \"You always took such good care of your toys. You used to say they had feelings. That if you left one out, it'd be lonely.\"\n\n You nod, fingers brushing the turtle's seam. \"I guess part of me still thinks that.\"\n\n She smiles. \"I don't think that's a bad part.\"\n\n You hold the turtle close for a moment longer.\n\n Somehow, it's just a plushie and also not.\n\n \n You walk slowly along the edge of a display shaped like a giant wooden crescent moon, plushies stacked like sleepy stars along its curve. You're scanning for something that calls out to you, but instead, for whatever reason, your eyes flick toward your mom.\n\n She's a few steps behind you, trailing thoughtfully, her purse held loosely at her side. She's not on her phone or pretending to be preoccupied. Just watching. Letting you move at your own pace.\n\n You reach for a plushie shaped like a donut with tiny legs and a worried little smile stitched into the frosting, then pause. A thought strikes you.\n\n You glance back. \"Hey... what about you, Mom?\"\n \n She looks up. \"Me?\"\n\n You nod and hold the plush out toward her. \"If you had to pick one. What would you go for?\"\n\n She blinks, caught off guard, then lets out a soft laugh—surprised, but not dismissive. \"You want me to get one?\"\n\n \"I mean... yeah,\" you say. \"You're allowed to like cute things too.\"\n\n She walks over and takes the donut from you, squinting at its little face. \"This one looks like it's apologizing just for existing.\"\n\n You grin. \"Relatable.\"\n\n She chuckles, then sets it gently back on the shelf and scans the rows around her. Her fingers drift over a sleepy seal, then a penguin with a scarf. Eventually, she pauses at a slightly lopsided fox with a patch on one ear.\n\n Her expression softens.\n\n \"I like this one,\" she says after a moment, picking it up carefully. \"It's kind of ragged-looking. I like that.\"\n\n You watch her tilt it in her hands. There's something kind in the way she holds it—absent-minded, sure, but familiar. You can't help but wonder how many toys she held like this when you were little. How many nights she tucked a plushie back under your arm after you dropped it in your sleep.\n\n \"Would you actually keep it?\" you ask, half-smiling.\n\n She shrugs, giving the fox a small pat on the head. \"I mean, why not? I don't need one. But... I wouldn't mind having something nice on my nightstand. Something a little dumb. Something soft.\"\n\n Then she looks over at you, her tone playful: \"You don't grow out of needing comfort, [name]. You just stop giving yourself permission to ask for it.\"\n\n You fall quiet for a second.\n\n She doesn't push. She just stands there, holding the little fox with its mismatched ears, perfectly comfortable.\n\n For some reason, asking that question made everything feel a little easier.\n\n \n You're standing in front of a wall named \"Huggables,\" but it's less of a wall and more of a soft mountain of plushies the size of laundry baskets. There are squishy whales, sleepy lions, and one enormous jellyfish that seems to be made of pure marshmallow.\n\n Your mom gives it a skeptical poke. \"I'm sorry, but where would this even go? It would take up half your bed.\"\n\n \"I think that's the point,\" you reply, snorting.\n\n She raises an eyebrow and glances at you. \"So? You going big today? Something to really flop onto?\"\n\n You pause. You hadn't really thought about it that way—but as you scan the pile of oversized plushies again, they don't quite call out to you. You know they're soft, and they'd be comfortable in theory. But they feel... overwhelming. Too big. Too much.\n\n You drift a few steps back toward a bin labeled \"Pocket Pals,\" filled with smaller plushies you can cup in one hand. Some are shaped like cats curled into balls. Others are tiny bees and bunnies. They don't try to be the center of attention. Instead, they just... exist.\n\n \"I think I like the smaller ones better,\" you admit after a moment. \"I don't know. The big ones are nice, sure, but I'd probably never touch it.\"\n\n Your mom nods thoughtfully. \"That makes sense.\" She reaches into the bin and picks up a tiny gray bear with a tiny heart stitched onto its chest. \"After all, you were always the kid who brought the smallest plush on the trip. Never the big flashy one. Just the little guy that fit in your pocket.\"\n\n You smile, because you remember. You used to tuck one into your backpack at school sometimes. Just to have something with you.\n\n \"I like that they're small enough to keep around,\" you say. \"They don't take up space, they're just a part of it.\"\n\n She turns the bear around in her hands, then gently places it back. \"It's like having company without needing to explain anything.\"\n\n You glance at her, surprised that she gets it.\n\n She gives a small shrug. \"What? I raised you. I know what comfort looks like on your face.\"\n\n Your ears go a little warm, but you smile. She's not wrong.\n\n It feels like something soft and small will make you feel seen.\n\n \n You find yourself standing in front of the \"Huggables\" wall—if you can even call it a wall. It's more like an avalanche, to say the least. The oversized animals are stacked in huge, pillowy heaps: giant sleepy whales, a bear lying flat like it gave up on life, a giraffe that's mostly neck, and an octopus so wide you could use it as a couch.\n\n Your mom eyes the pile with a hint of awe. \"Okay, I knew you liked stuffed animals, but I didn't know you liked... ones these big.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, laughing under your breath. \"I kind of do.\"\n\n \"I mean, I respect the commitment,\" she says, eyebrows raised. \"But look at that one. It's as big as a dorm mattress.\"\n\n You walk a little closer, trailing your fingers along a huge tan cat with a soft stitched yawn and paws the size of your face. It's ridiculous. Massive. It would dominate your bed, leave less room for your legs, and probably steal the blanket in the middle fo the night. And you still love it.\n\n \"I like that they're so... I don't know. Solid,\" you say after a second. \"Like you can really hold onto them. They don't feel like something you'll lose under the covers.\"\n\n Your mom studies you for a beat, listening.\n\n \"Now that I think about it, I think it's all about the weight,\" you continue, half to yourself. \"Like... when I hug a big one, it feels like something is hugging back.\"\n\n She smiles at that, more tenderly than you expect.\n\n \"Now that,\" she says softly, \"makes perfect sense.\"\n\n You bend slightly and pull out a huge frog with long limbs and sleepy eyes. It practically spills out of your arms, but when you hug it to your chest, it presses back with just enough weight to feel there.\n\n \"I don't care if it takes up the whole bed,\" you admit, grinning a little. \"It just feels good.\"\n\n Your mom folds her arms and leans against the nearby shelf. \"Well, we'll need to find room in the trunk if this thing's coming home. Might have to strap it into the backseat.\"\n\n You both laugh, and she reaches out to squish the frog's foot with her hand. \"You always were a tactile kid,\" she adds. \"You used to fall asleep clinging to your pillow like it was going to float away.\"\n\n You press your cheek into the plushie for a moment. \"Suppose some things haven't changed.\"\n\n \"And some things shouldn't.\"\n \n\n[Choice: Pick a plushie]",

      "text": "You wander a little deeper into the store, the air growing even softer somehow. Your mom trails behind you, still smiling faintly. She doesn't say anything, instead letting you take your time. The only sound is the quiet lull of the music and the muffled crinkle of tags as you gently pick up the possibilities.\n\nYou're only getting one. That's the rule. Space, budget, logic—they all say one.\n\nBut your heart? It makes things harder.\n\nYou stop at a low shelf nestled near the floor, where a goat plushie sits quietly. It's soft gray with tiny, twisted felt horns and hooves that look like they were sewn lovingly. It's got a dumb, slightly lopsided grin, and its little tail sticks out like it's mid-hop.\n\nYou grin without meaning to. \"This guy looks like it eats paper when you're not watching.\"\n\nYour mom snorts. \"It'd definitely chew through your math homework and then blame it on someone else.\"\n\nYou hold it for a second longer. It's weird, but also kind of perfect.\n\nA few steps over, tucked in a small basket like it's hiding, you spot a meerkat plushie—long body, beady eyes, paws tucked up like it's always on alert. It looks perpetually curious and nervous, like it wants to be included but also doesn't want to mess anything up.\n\nYou run a thumb across its fur and say, \"I think this one's overthinking everything.\"\n\nYour mom leans over and squints. \"Reminds me of someone.\"\n\n\"Rude,\" you state, giving her a playful glare. \"Accurate, sure. But rude.\"\n\nOn a nearby table, posed between two sunflowers made of fabric, you see a round, fuzzy, bee plushie. It's got stubby little wings, a soft yellow belly, and a dopey stitched smile like it doesn't know how to fly but is still trying really, really hard. The wings flap when you shake it a little.\n\nYour mom hums in amusement. \"It looks like it'd be good at giving pep talks and bad at personal space.\"\n\nYou gently pat its fuzzy head, and it boings slightly. \"Come on, it's trying his best.\"\n\n \n Then, just as you're about to move on, your eyes catch on a display near the checkout. Sitting quietly on a shelf is that ragged fox plushie your mom picked up earlier. The one with the crooked ear and the threadbare patch on its belly. It's right where she left it, a little slouched, still waiting.\n\n She notices you noticing.\n\n \"Oh, don't worry about that one,\" she says quickly, brushing it off. \"I just thought it was cute. I don't need one.\"\n\n But her voice is a little too quick and a little too dismissive.\n\n You turn to her, watching the way she glances down, not quite meeting your eyes. You remember the way she held it earlier—absently, sure, but with a kind of fondness that's impossible to fake. You could get that one for her. As a quiet thank you. For all of this.\n\n \n \"It really is, isn't it,\" your mom comments.\n \n\n\"I can only get one,\" you mutter, steeling yourself.\n\nYour mom, now beside you again, lifts a brow and crosses her arms. \"No pressure,\" she says lightly. \"But do make it count.\"\n\nYou look between them all—each one a different kind of comfort.\n\nDespite all of them saying something about you, only one's coming home.\n\n \n<<if [money] > 19>> \n [Choice: Get the goat plushie]\n [Choice: Get the meerkat plushie]\n [Choice: Get the bee plushie]\n \n [Choice: Get the fox plushie for your mom]\n \n \n[Choice: Decide against getting a plushie]",

The plushies stare back at you—not literally, of course, but the way their little stitched eyes gleam under the soft lights, you feel them watching.\n\n You glance at the crooked grin of the goat, the little meerkat standing tall as if still hoping you'll reach for it, and the bee buzzing as it waits. Each one still. Quiet. Expectant.\n\n Your mom stands a few feet away, not saying anything. She thinks this is simple. A cute store. A little shopping trip.\n\n But it really isn't that simple. Not to you, at least.\n\n You look down at your hands and they're empty. You fold your arms slowly, then unfold them. The ache in your chest doesn't come from not finding the right one. It comes from something harder to name.\n\n You take a step back.\n\n And for a split second, it feels like the air changes.\n\n The plushies don't move. But your imagination fills the space.\n\n The bee's smile wilts just a little. The meerkat lowers its paws. The little goat that once looked so mischievous now just seems.. confused.\n\n You walk past the shelf, and you swear you feel them lean toward you. Just slightly. Like a whisper, begging you to not go.\n\n But you do.\n\n Your mom notices your empty hands as you approach the exit. She glances at you, quiet for a second. \"Changed your mind?\"\n\n You nod once. \"Yeah.\"\n\n That's all you say. And as the door chimes behind you, the warmth of the store fades, replaced by the colder hum of the mall.\n\n You don't look back. But part of you wishes that you had.\n\n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]\n\n \n \n \n You hold the goat plushie in your hands, its little lopsided smile still staring up at you like it knows exactly what it is and couldn't care less. Its soft gray body fits perfectly in the crook of your arm, like it's been carried around forever. The felt horns are slightly crooked, and one ear sticks out at a defiant angle.\n\n You squeeze it gently.\n\n It doesn't just feel right. It feels like you picked each other.\n\n Your mom chuckles from beside you. \"A goat, huh?\"\n\n \"He's got something going on,\" you reply, nodding. \"You can tell just by looking at him.\"\n\n She smirks. \"Definitely plotting something. Probably sabotage. Or tax evasion.\"\n\n You head to the front with him tucked under your arm, where a cheerful employee with glitter nail polish and a name tag that reads Jenn greets you behind the corner.\n\n \"Oh my God,\" Jenn says, beaming. \"You picked Grumble Goat! That's one of our limited runs. We call him Grumble because he always looks like he's about to lecture a room full of children.\"\n\n You laugh. \"That does track.\"\n\n Jenn rings him up, scanning the little tag with care, then gestures toward a nearby kiosk lined with pastel paper and screens.\n\n \"Alright, here comes the fun part,\" she says. \"Every plushie adoption comes with a welcome certificate. You get to give him a name and tell us a little about him, and we'll print it out for you.\"\n\n \"Oh,\" you blink. \"Like.. a real name name?\"\n\n \"Yup,\" she nods, grinning. \"His identity is in your hands.\"\n\n You glance at the screen, then down at the goat. He stares back, smug.\n\n \"I feel like if I don't name him something ridiculous, he'll haunt me,\" you say.\n\n Jenn snorts. \"He'll haunt you either way. But naming him seals the bond.\"\n\n Your mom laughs quietly behind you. \"Better not pick something you'll regret.\"\n\n You stand there, typing slowly on the soft, glowing screen. After a moment of thought, you enter a name.\n\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n \n \n You hold the little meerkat plushie gently in your hands, its tiny paws curled close to its chest, its eyes wide with that familiar, soft anxiety. There's something about it that makes you want to keep it safe. You imagine it standing guard on your desk, nervously watching over your snacks and overthinking every decision you make. It's sweet. Loyal. Just a little nervous. The little guy seems like he's still not entirely convinced it deserves to be picked.\n\n \"I like this one,\" you murmur, and your mom smiles from beside you.\n\n \"He's got a worried little face,\" she says, reaching over to lightly tap his nose. \"Like he's concerned about your laundry.\"\n\n \"Or my grades.\"\n\n \"Which, to be fair, someone should be.\"\n\n The employee at the counter—Jenn, according to her glittery name tag—looks up to you as you approach, her expression lighting up when she sees who you've chosen.\n\n \"Ooh,\" she says, clapping her hands once. \"You picked a PeekPal!\"\n\n You blink. \"A what now?\"\n\n She leans over the counter and gestures to the tag on the meerkat's side. Sure enough, printed in soft blocky font: PeekPal Series — For The Quiet Kind of Brave.\n\n \"They're one of our newer lines,\" Jenn explains. \"Designed for people who overthink everything but still show up anyway. This guy's part of the \"Cautious but Courageous\" collection.\"\n\n You glance down at the meerkat, and his little stitched eyes somehow seem even more sincere now. You press your thumb gently against one of his tiny felt paws.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you murmur. \"That sounds about right.\"\n\n Jenn grins. \"He looks like he needs a loyal human. And snacks. Probably lots of snacks.\"\n\n Jenn rings him up, scanning the little tag with care, then gestures toward a nearby kiosk lined with pastel paper and screens. \"Alright, let's get him officially settled. Like all our new adoptions, he needs a name to go home with.\"\n\n She shows you the screen with softly blinking text: Name Your PeekPal\n\n Below it, a text field is already waiting—cursor blinking slowly.\n\n You look down at the meerkat in your arms. He stares back like he's ready to panic, but also maybe like he trusts you to handle this part.\n\n You adjust your grip just slightly, cradling him like something small and worth protecting.\n\n Jenn smiles warmly. \"Whenever you're ready.\"\n\n And you are.\n\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n \n \n The bee plushie's still right where you left it—propped up between two oversized sunflower made of fabric like it's trying its best to look important. Its fuzzy yellow belly is round, with stubby little black legs and soft felt wings that wobble slightly when you move it. It looks like it would absolutely volunteer for something and immediately panic about it.\n\n You reach for it without hesitation.\n\n There's something about this one. It's not the biggest, nor the softest, but it looks like it would sit next to you on your desk and remind you to drink water and breathe. Like it would give you a pep talk in a squeaky voice before an important exam, even if it was nervous too.\n\n Your mom watches as you hold it close to your chest, giving it an experimental squeeze. It squishes just enough. Like a hug and a cheer all in one.\n\n \"Is this the one?\" she asks gently.\n\n You nod.\n\n At the register, the employee at the counter—Jenn, according to her name tag—lights up the second she sees what you're holding.\n\n \"Ooh, you picked a BuzzBuddy!\"\n\n You blink. \"That's... a thing?\"\n\n Jenn nods, her earrings jingling as she grins. \"Absolutely. That's part of our Support Squad Line. BuzzBuddies are known for showing up, spiraling a little, and then doing their best anyway.\"\n\n You laugh—because yeah. It does track.\n\n Jenn rings the bee up, scanning the little tag with care, then gestures toward a nearby kiosk lined with pastel paper and screens. \"Here, this is the most important part of the adoption process.\"\n\n The screen in front of you glows with soft yellow and white, little sparkles floating lazily behind a blinking text box.\n\n Name Your BuzzBuddy\n\n The cursor blinks, waiting.\n\n You glance down at your bee. He stares back up at you with relentless optimism. It's like it's already buzzing with a name—it just needs you to say it out loud.\n\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n \n \n Fox Plushie Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n You spot the ragged little fox still sitting where your mom left it, its patchy ear folded slightly forward, as if it's been eavesdropping this whole time. It hasn't moved an inch—just resting there with that crooked tail and the worn thread on its belly like it's been waiting quietly to be remembered.\n\n You glance back at your mom.\n\n She's across the aisle, gently testing the squish of a mushroom-shaped pillow, pretending to be entirely focused on the texture. But her eyes flick over, just for a second, to where that little fox still sits.\n\n She looks away again like it didn't mean anything. Like she hadn't been thinking about it since she set it down.\n\n You pick it up, feeling the soft weight of it in your hands. It's a little older than the others, the stitching slightly uneven, the fur a little matted—but it is warm. Lopsided. Endearing in a way that makes your chest ache a little.\n\n It's definitely not the cutest plushie in the store, but it's the one your mom held earlier with fingers that lingered just a little too long. The one she set down carefully, pretending it hadn't mattered. You saw the soft smile flicker on her face when she thought you weren't looking.\n\n So you carry it to the counter, where a cheerful employee with glitter nail polish and a name tag that reads Jenn greets you behind the corner.\n\n \"Aww,\" she murmurs, reaching out to brush a thumb over the fox's patched ear. \"You're taking this little guy home? He's been waiting a long time.\"\n\n You glance over your shoulder at your mom, who's standing a few feet away, distracted by a display of oversized plush toast.\n\n \"He's not for me,\" you say, smiling.\n\n Jenn raises an eyebrow.\n\n You turn back toward your mom and call, \"Hey, Mom?\"\n\n She looks up. \"Yeah?\"\n\n You hold up the fox. \"I got this for you.\"\n\n Her expression falters, like you just knocked the wind out of her in the kindest way.\n\n She blinks once, twice. \"For me?\"\n\n \"Well, you did like him,\" you say, suddenly a little shy.\n\n She walks over slowly, her hand already lifting toward her chest like she's bracing for something. When you pass the fox into her arms, she holds him like something precious. Her fingers curl around his worn body, thumb resting just under his crooked ear.\n\n \"Oh, sweetheart...\" she says, voice wavering at the edges. \"I wasn't expecting—\"\n\n She stops.\n\n Because her throat catches.\n\n She holds the plush closer, clutching it against her chest like he's something warm she's been needing for a long time. You watch her eyes glass over, and even though she tries to wave it off—\"It's just a silly plush, I'm fine, I'm fine\"—you know it's more than that.\n\n You can see it.\n\n She presses a kiss to the fox's head like it's instinct, like this is something she forgot she needed. Like maybe no one's ever given her something soft just for her in a long, long time.\n\n Jenn stays quiet, smiling wide but not saying anything as she leads you to a kiosk. \"He's all yours now,\" she says softly. \"Go ahead—give him his name.\"\n\n Your mom sniffs once and laughs again, wiping the corner of her eye with the back of her hand. \"He needs something proper,\" she murmurs, clearing her throat. \"Something that suits him. He's been through a lot, I can tell.\"\n\n She looks down at the screen. The words Name your Plush Friend blink back at her, waiting.\n\n She glances at you again before turning back to type. The little fox in her arms shifts ever so slightly as she leans forward, still held close like he might just fly away.\n\n Your mom names him.\n\n [Choice: Continue]",

It's so dumb and earnest you can't help but grin.\n\n \"[goatplushieName],\" the employee reads with absolute sincerity, as if this is a sacred naming ceremony. \"Excellent choice. Very noble.\"\n\n She taps a few more buttons and then turns the screen around to you so you and your goat can see it together:\n\n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, [goatplushieName]!\n\n A digital badge appears beneath it that says \"Certified Goofball.\"\n\n \"Alright!\" she says cheerfully. \"Let's make it official.\"\n\n She leads you over to a little podium with a soft, pastel printer built into it. From the top slides out a cream-colored certificate printed on a thick, textured paper. She carefully pulls it free and presents it to you like it's a diploma.\n\n You take it with both hands. It reads:\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that [goatplushieName], a Goat of Great Personality and Questionable Impulse Control, has been lovingly adopted by [name] on this day. May your hugs be strong, your snacks be shared, and your secrets be safe.\n\n You almost laugh, but you don't. Not really. Something about it feels honest. Like it matters, even if just a little.\n\n The employee wraps [goatplushieName] in a soft tissue paper blanket, careful not to squish his horns, and gently places him into a white tote bag printed with the Cuddle Creations logo: a sleeping moon curled around a smiling bear.\n\n \"Take good care of him, alright?\" she says, her voice lighter now. \"Let me tell you, he's definitely one of the troublemakers.\"\n\n Your mom takes the bag while you tuck the certificate away, and as both of you step out of the store, she glances at you sideways.\n\n \"[goatplushieName], huh?\"\n\n You shrug. \"It felt right.\"\n\n She smiles. \"He seems like a handful.\"\n\n You smile back, your hands resting against the outside of the bag, feeling the faint plush curve of his little goat ear through the fabric.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"But he's mine.\"\n\n \n You take a breath, then tap at the screen. Your fingers hover for just a second, then you type: [meerkatplushieName].\n\n There's a soft ding as the screen sparkles with a flash of yellow and beige confetti. A tiny animated version of your meerkat appears in the corner, popping out behind a cactus with a little digital squeak.\n\n Jenn gasps like it's a sacred rite. \"[meerkatplushieName]! Oh my God, that is perfect. He sounds like someone who apologizes every time he sneezes.\"\n\n You glance down at the little guy in your arms. \"Yeah,\" you murmur, smiling a little.\n\n She taps a few more buttons and then turns the screen around to you so you and your new buddy can see it together:\n \n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, [meerkatplushieName]!\n\n A digital badge appears beneath it that says \"Overthinker, Hug Magnet, Snack Enthusiast.\"\n\n \"Alright!\" Jenn says, clearly delighted. \"Let's make it official.\"\n\n She leads you over to a side counter with a rounded little podium and a pastel printer. From the top, a cream-colored certificate slides out slowly, printed on textured paper that smells faintly of vanilla.\n\n She pulls it free with both hands and presents it to you like it's a diploma.\n\n It reads:\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that [meerkatplushieName], a proud member of the PeekPal Series, has been lovingly adopted by [name] on this day. Though he lives in constant fear of loud noises and minor inconveniences, he will show up, be brave, and offer his tiny paws anyway. Provide snacks often. Encouragement always.\n\n You almost chuckle.\n\n Jenn wraps [meerkatplushieName] in pale yellow tissue paper with a tiny sticker that says \"He's safe now.\" Then she places him into a soft blue tote bag printed with the Cuddle Creations logo: a sleepy moon cuddling with a bear.\n\n \"Keep him close,\" she says, her voice softer now. \"He's the kind that needs reminding he's loved. But I think you're the right person for that.\"\n\n Your mom accepts the bag with a little nod of thanks while you tuck the certificate carefully into your backpack. As you both exit the store, she glances over with a smile tugging at her lips.\n\n \"[meerkatplushieName]?\" she asks, amused.\n\n You shrug, your hands brushing the outside of the bag where the plush's little curled arms are pressed under the fabric.\n\n \"He looked like a [meerkatplushieName].\"\n\n Your mum hums. \"He looks like he'd worry about it if you didn't name him right.\"\n\n You smile back, quiet and full.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"But I think I got it right.\"\n\n \n You tap the screen slowly, thumbs hovering for a moment.\n\n Then you type: [beeplushieName].\n\n The tablet gives a cheerful ding and erupts in a burst of animated flowers, glitter, and little pixel bees that zigzag around the screen in chaotic, excited loops. One of them bumps into a flower and just kind of spins.\n\n Jenn gasps in mock awe. \"[beeplushieName]! That's adorable.\"\n\n She taps a few more buttons, grinning like she's helping officiate a wedding. Then she turns the screen around so you and your fuzzy new friend can see it together:\n\n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, [beeplushieName]!\n\n A digital badge appears underneath: \"Certified Encouragement Specialist – Level 1 Buzz\"\n\n Jenn claps. \"Okay! Let's make it official.\"\n\n She leads you to a curved podium where the little marshmallow-looking printer whirs to life. A cream-colored certificate slides out from the top, printed on soft textured paper with a honeycomb border and a smiling bee in the corner.\n\n She hands it to you with both hands like it's sacred. You take it carefully. It reads:\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that [beeplushieName], proud member of the BuzzBuddy Support Squad, has been lovingly adopted by [name] on this day. Though he is often overwhelmed and mildly vibrating with panic, he will always try his best, encourage those around him, and commit to emotional support with great enthusiasm. Buzz responsibly.\n\n You stare at the words, feeling something settle in your chest—light, but firm. A tiny voice whispering \"you've got this.\"\n\n Jenn gently wraps [beeplushieName] in yellow tissue paper patterned with little daisies and places him in a sunny gold tote bag with the Cuddle Creations logo and the words \"Soft Friends, Big Feelings\" beneath it.\n\n She hands it over with a wink. \"He's gonna freak out a little, but don't worry—he's a loyal little guy once he settles.\"\n\n Your mom accepts the bag while you tuck the certificate carefully into your backpack. As you both leave the store, she glances at you sideways with a knowing smile.\n\n \"[beeplushieName], huh?\"\n\n You shrug, already holding the bag close. \"He just looked like he had a lot of feelings.\"\n\n She smiles back. \"That's a perfect match, then.\"\n\n You don't argue. Instead, you just walk a little lighter, the soft weight of [beeplushieName] pressed to your side—like maybe, just maybe, you really do have this.\n\n \n Your mom's fingers hover over the tablet for a long moment before she types.\n\n Percy.\n\n There's a soft ding as the screen glows gold and orange, a tiny digital fox trotting across the screen with a little patched belly, twirling once before curling up beside the words:\n\n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, Percy!\n\n A small digital badge appears underneath: \"Certified Resilience Specialist – Classy and a Little Worn In\"\n\n Jenn clasps her hands to her chest. \"Oh my God, that's so sweet. Percy! He sounds like he wears sweaters and knows when you need tea.\"\n\n Your mom laughs, still a little teary-eyed, and brushes her knuckle gently against Percy's soft, uneven head. \"Oh, he absolutely does.\"\n\n Jenn taps a few more buttons, and the adoption printer hums softly behind the counter. From the top slides a cream-colored certificate, edged in tiny acorns and little pawprints. She pulls it free and hands it to your mom. Your mom takes it slowly, like she's afraid it'll vanish if she grabs it too fast.\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that Percy, a fox of patience, wisdom, and slight grumpiness in the mornings, has been lovingly adopted by Hannah on this day. May he bring comfort, companionship, and perfectly timed cuddles when the world asks too much and your tea gets cold. He may look a little scruffy, but that just means he's lived—and is still here.\n\n Your mom lets out a shaky breath, smiling so wide now she doesn't even try to hide it. She doesn't say anything for a few seconds—just keeps looking at the paper like it says something more than what's written.\n\n Then Jenn gently wraps Percy in warm orange tissue paper, folding it neatly around him with a sticker that reads: \"He's safe now.\"\n\n She places him into a soft gray bag with the Cuddle Creations logo and hands it over. Your mom hesitates, then hugs the bags close like it holds more than a plush. Almost as if it holds her heart.\n\n Jenn beams. \"He's a good one. Quiet type, but loyal. I think he's been waiting for exactly you.\"\n\n Your mom doesn't say thank you, at least not with words. She just nods and wipes beneath her eyes with her knuckle again, eyes shining.\n\n As you both step out of the store together, her arm brushes yours. She doesn't say anything right away. Then: \"Thank you,\" she murmurs. \"You didn't have to... but you did.\"\n\n \"He looked like he needed someone,\" you say, looking over and smiling softly. \"I figured you did too.\"\n\n She presses the bag a little closer to her chest, and the look she gives you is one of understanding, love, and that quiet kind of gratitude that doesn't go away.\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

Everything's curated, intentional, and cool without trying too hard.\n\nYou hesitate at the entrance for a half-second, but your mom gives you a quiet nudge forward.\n\n\"Go on, [name],\" she says, half-smiling. \"Let's see what the trendy kids are doing these days.\"\n\nInside, the air is crisp but cozy, with a faint scent of fresh linen and something vaguely fruity. The lighting is warm and layered, glowing from sconces on the wall and spotlights above. It makes the clothes feel lit from within.\n\nRacks curve through the space in gentle arcs, showing off cute halter tops, crop cardigans, and mid-rise skirts in soft fabrics. It's definitely trendy, and feels young.\n\nYour mom steps in beside you, eyeing a rack of tops. \"Okay, this one's way more fun than I expected,\" she says, tilting her head. \"Not bad.\"\n\nYou nod, eyes darting between the walls. It's already a little overwhelming—not in a bad way, but just because you don't know where to even begin.\n\nA sales associate appears a few seconds later with an effortless bounce that suggests they've worn every piece in the store twice already. Their name tag reads \"Elle (they/them)\" and they catch the hesitation in your body language instantly. \"No worries, I got you,\" they say, already turning toward one of the central racks. \"You just hang tight for a sec.\"\n\nYou blink, unsure whether to be grateful or nervous, as they start pulling a handful of pieces from different parts of the store.\n\n\"Okay,\" Elle says, holding the stack of outfits like a proud offering. \"Mix of easy layers, soft colors, fun silhouettes. Try what you like, skip what you don't. There's no pressure whatsoever.\"\n\nThey gesture toward a short hallway along the side of the store. \"Fitting rooms are this way. Got one open for you already.\"\n\nYou glance toward your mom, who gives you an encouraging nod from where she's still browsing. With a small breath, you follow Elle through the rows of clothing and step past a beige curtain into a softly lit changing room. The mirror is clean, the lighting kind, and the bench even has a little throw blanket on it.\n\nElle sets the outfits on the wall hooks before turning you with a little wink. \"You've got this. Take your time.\"\n\nThen they slip out and draw the curtain closed behind them.\n\n[Choice: Try outfits on]",

They settle onto your frame like they were waiting. There's no awkward tugging or uncomfortable shifting. Just warmth. Just you.\n\n The skirt swishes around your legs with a light, playful motion every time you move, and the top rests gently against your chest. You do a little turn in the mirror. You don't even flinch. Instead, you smile.\n\n You like what you see.\n\n There's a quiet thrill in how natural it feels. How your shoulders relax, how your posture changes without even thinking. This isn't pretending. It's discovering.\n\n You slip back into the clothes you wore in after, slower than usual, carefully folding each item as you place it back onto the hook. Your hand lingers on the black slit skirt. You hesitate.\n\n You glance at your reflection one last time, and your heart answers before your brain catches up.\n\n I want this.\n\n You step out, cheeks warm. The store music hums gently as you make your way back toward the front, where your mom looks up from her spot near the accessories wall. She takes one look at your expression and doesn't say a word—just smiles like she knows.\n\n You're not sure how much you'll buy. Maybe just one piece. But that doesn't matter. What does matter is you're buying something for you. And it feels like the person you're buying for is real.\n\n \n The clothes fit. Technically.\n\n The sleeves aren't too tight, the skirt falls just right, and the soft tops don't cling in a weird way. You look... fine. Objectively speaking, maybe even kind of good. You can imagine someone else wearing them and pulling it off without blinking.\n\n But as you stare at yourself in the mirror, you feel a weird kind of distance building between you and your reflection.\n\n You tug on the collar on the cream top. Adjust the waistband of the skirt. Do a half-turn.\n\n It's not bad, but it doesn't feel like you.\n\n You want it to. You try. You picture how this would look in public. Maybe if your posture was different or if your head was clearer. You sigh, pressing your palms against the sides of your thighs. You're not disgusted, not upset. Just... disconnected. Like this is someone else's closet and you're just borrowing their role.\n\n You change back, fold the pieces, and pick them up.\n\n You step out of the changing room and make your way toward the front, the sound of faint pop music following you. Your mom notices your silence, but doesn't say anything. She doesn't need to.\n\n You're not sure what, if anything, you'll buy.\n\n But something in you knows this wasn't really about the clothes. And maybe... maybe that's why it's so hard to decide.\n \n\n[Choice: Is there anything to buy?]",

It's not heavy, but it feels full. Full of something real. Something you picked because it made you feel more you.\n\n Your mom walks beside you, smiling gently but not saying much—like she doesn't want to shatter the quiet little joy blooming inside you. She doesn't need to say anything. You know she saw your face when you stepped out of the fitting room. The glow you tried (and failed) to play off.\n\n You glance down at the bag and smile again. Still quiet. Still giddy.\n\n Not like it changes everything.\n\n Just... makes it all feel a little closer. A little truer.\n\n Your reflection in the store window you pass doesn't feel like a stranger. It's not perfect, but it's definitely not wrong, either. It's a version of you that you want to get to know better.\n\n Your mom gently rubs your shoulder.\n\n \"Feel good about it?\" she asks.\n\n You nod, letting out a soft breath. \"Yeah. I really do.\"\n\n She just smiles.\n\n You walk a little taller after that. Still nervous. But proud. Like maybe—finally—you've taken a step not toward someone you're supposed to be, but toward someone you already are.\n\n \n You step out of NovaTrend holding the bag a little awkwardly, like you're not sure whether to treat it like a prize or a massive mistake.\n\n The clothes inside are folded perfectly, the receipt tucked neatly at the bottom. The store associate smiled as they handed it to you, told you to enjoy it, and to come back anytime. They meant it. You could tell.\n\n But the moment the door closed behind you, you felt something inside you unraveling at the edges.\n\n Your mom walks beside you, glancing over once or twice. She doesn't say anything. Maybe she senses it—that weird weight sitting in your chest, light and dull at the same time.\n\n The mall feels brighter now, somehow more exposed. You try not to think about what the clothes will look like on you again once you're home. Will they feel strange? Too much or not enough?\n\n You don't really have any regret, but there is uncertainty. Like you bought something for someone you might be. That's the part that makes your throat feel tight. You just don't know.\n\n Your mom finally breaks the silence.\n\n \"You did okay in there,\" she says.\n\n \"Thanks,\" you murmur, forcing a smile.\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

      "text": "ShatterBox has the energy of a haunted house that was repurposed into a fashion boutique. The walls are painted matte black with purple LED strips coiling around shelves like digital vines. Posters of alternative bands, cryptic album cover art, and glitchy horror hang at aggressive angles. The music pulses with slow, heavy basslines, and the mannequins all look like they'd rather hex you than sell you something.\n\nYou step in, and your mom gives you a strange glance. She doesn't say anything though—she's smart enough to know this place speaks a language she doesn't. She lingers near the door as you start browsing.\n\nA few items hang in scattered order—lots of mesh, studs, chains, and cryptic black tees. Most of the price tags are either marked \"Display Only\" or tagged with \"Coming Soon\" stickers.\n\nThat's when you hear boots clomp out from behind a curtain near the back.\n\nThe sales associate rounds the corner with the aura of someone who has metal as their alarm clock and judges your soul by your eyeliner symmetry. She's wearing black lipstick, a lace-up corset over a shredded band tee, and a pendant shaped like a moon that's the size of a toddler.\n\nHer eyes narrow rather playfully.\n\n\"You look like you're either curious or about to make a life-changing mistake,\" she says, voice flat. \"Both are welcome here..\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Uh—just browsing?\"\n\nShe snorts. \"Sure. That's what they all say.\" She walks toward you, the silver chains on her combat boots clinking softly against the concrete floor. \"You've got that 'what would happen if I wore something that matches my soul' energy. If you get what I mean.\"\n\nYou start to laugh, but she's already walking, gesturing for you to follow.\n\n\"Look, our whole system glitched last week,\" she says over her shoulder, weaving between racks of fishnets and distressed hoodies. \"Classic cursed technology. Half our stock's stuck in inventory purgatory. We're only allowed to sell what physically survived the purge.\"\n\nShe stops dramatically, and then reaches behind a mannequin.\n\n\"And that's this,\" she says, pulling out a single hanger like it's a ceremonial weapon.\n\nIt's a full outfit. Jet-black off-shoulder dress with a lace trim. There's a fitted belt with a little heart-shaped ring at the center. Attached to the hanger are fishnet tights, and dangling between the hem, a pair of heavy-soled combat boots with chrome buckles that look like they could crush a soda can, your self-esteem, and maybe even you in one stomp.\n\n\"This one made it through,\" she says, letting the hanger swing between you like a pendulum. \"Wrong tag, flagged for discard, but I marked it as a display item so I could keep it on hand. Only reason it's not sold already is because no one's had the vibe for it.\"\n\nShe eyes you again, her smile widening just slightly. \"But you do.\"\n\nYou feel your face heat.\n\nThe girl flips the hanger in her hand and nods toward the fitting rooms. \"Try it. Or don't. But if you don't, I guarantee some watered-down TikTok goth wannabe is gonna wander in later and ruin its potential.\"\n\nShe tosses you a wink, like this is a test you didn't know you were taking—but might actually want to pass.\n\nYour fingers brush the fabric, and for a moment, you wonder what it'd be like to be a version of yourself that would want to wear something like this.\n\nShe raises an eyebrow. \"Well? The fitting room's open and the mirror doesn't bite.\"\n\n[Choice: Try it on]\n[Choice: Decide against wearing it]",

Your fingers brush the lace edging, and something in your chest gives the tiniest tug.\n\n Maybe it's curiosity. Maybe it's a challenge. Maybe it's that voice that whispers \"what if\" before you can shut it down.\n\n You glance up at the goth girl. She's still watching, arms crossed and hips cocked like she's got all the time in the world. There's no smirk though, just quiet expectation.\n\n You swallow. \"Alright,\" you say. \"I'll try it.\"\n\n Her face lights up—not in excitement, exactly, but satisfaction. \"Knew it,\" she mutters. Then she hands over the hanger.\n\n The outfit feels heavier in your hands now that it belongs to you, even temporarily. You glance toward the fitting rooms, then back at your mom—still waiting just outside the store entrance, pretending not to be hovering. She catches your eye and raises her brows. You don't say anything, opting to turn and walk toward the fitting rooms.\n\n Inside, the space is narrow and dim, with a single full-length mirror and a flickering overhead light that hums softly like it's judging you. You hang the outfit carefully, then start to change.\n\n The dress fits better than it has any right to. It slips over your shoulders and hugs your frame without clinging. The off-shoulder neckline brushes against your collarbones. The chain belt clicks softly as you tighten it, and when you step into the combat boots, you actually feel taller. Not just literally, but figuratively as well.\n\n You turn to face the mirror.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n For a second, you freeze.\n\n You barely recognize yourself. But not in a bad way.\n\n The person looking back at you fits into the moment. The black lace, the boots, the slightly chaotic layering of softness and sharpness—it all just makes sense in a weird way.\n\n You tilt your head.\n\n Maybe this isn't how you'd dress every day, but in this moment, you think you look pretty damn good.\n\n From outside the curtain, the attendant's voice cuts through:\n\n \"So?\"\n\n You take one more glance at the mirror before responding.\n\n \"I can't lie, it's kind of awesome,\" you call back, a little breathless.\n\n You hear a satisfied hum. \"Told you.\"\n\n [Choice: Step outside]\n\n \n You hesitate.\n\n Your fingers almost reach for the dress, for the weight of it, for the weird little thrill that hit your chest when she said it looked like it was meant for you—but then your hand drops back to your side.\n\n You shake your head, offering a polite smile. \"I don't think it's really my thing.\"\n\n The girl pauses. Her smirk fades—not into disappointment, exactly, but it's clear that she is mildly bummed.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says, letting the dress hanger fall back against the rack with a soft clack. \"No pressure. You don't have to want it.\"\n\n She leans one elbow against a mannequin's base. \"Sometimes it just takes a minute. Or a few years. Or never. Doesn't matter. The look'll still be here if you ever change your mind.\"\n\n You give a little shrug and a quiet \"Thanks,\" before stepping back toward the front of the store.\n\n She doesn't follow you, doesn't hound you or try to sell anything else. Just calls out behind you with an edge of dry humor, \"Hope you find what you're looking for. Or at least something that doesn't totally suck.\"\n\n You step out of ShatterBox, the mall's neutral lighting instantly making everything feel a little more normal again. The heavy music and black-on-black aesthetic are behind you now.\n\n Your mom is waiting just a few feet away, standing near a potted plant that definitely hasn't seen natural light in a few decades. She straightens when she sees you.\n\n \"Well?\" she asks, her tone light but curious. \"Find anything?\"\n\n You shake your head. \"They had this one outfit. It was... kind of intense.\"\n\n She raises a brow. \"[name], the whole store looked intense. I just had to step out, it felt like I was going to get judged by a rack of mesh tops.\"\n\n You let out a quiet laugh. \"It was definitely a vibe.\"\n\n \"Mhm,\" she murmurs. \"I get it though, that kind of place probably feels really right for some people. Just... not everyone. And that's fine. You don't have to force yourself into something just because it's bold or different.\"\n\n You nod.\n\n She starts walking again with you beside her. After a few steps, she adds, more offhandedly, \"Although those boots did look like they could survive just about anything. I kind of respect that.\"\n\n You glance sideways at her. \"Are you thinking of getting a pair, Mom?\"\n\n She gives you a flat look. \"Please. My ankles wouldn't make it ten feet.\"\n\n Your mom doesn't pry or lecture, she's just... here. Like always.\n\n And you keep walking.\n\n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

You can feel your heart thudding, not from nerves, but from something more electric.\n\n Then you step out.\n\n The boots land with a soft thunk against the concrete, and you lift your chin instinctively. You expect to feel self-conscious, but the moment you see your reflection again, something inside you settles.\n\n You really do look... incredible.\n\n Somehow, the whole thing feels like it was made for this version of you. Not someone you're pretending to be. Just... you.\n\n The salesgirl leans against the wall, arms crossed, a smug grin tugging at her mouth. \"Okay, yeah. I was right. You look killer.\"\n\n You blink, then laugh. \"I kinda love it.\"\n\n Your mom looks up from where she'd been scrolling on her phone, and the expression that crosses her face is hard to pin down—surprise, maybe. But also warmth. Not confusion or disapproval, just complicated pride.\n\n \"You wear that like you've been waiting for it, huh?\" she says, tilting her head.\n\n You feel your cheeks heat, but you don't shrink away. If anything, you stand a little taller.\n\n \"Maybe I have,\" you say.\n\n \n You push the curtain open slowly, stepping out into the soft light of the shop, arms folded tightly over your chest. The boots thud as you walk, and the dress sways a little more than you're comfortable with. You try to walk normally, to not overthink how the belt rests on your hips or how much shoulder the neckline shows.\n\n You glance at the mirror.\n\n And... yeah. It fits. Technically. The look is bold, sure. But it feels like you're wearing someone else's skin. Like you're trying to pull off a part in a play you never auditioned for. You don't hate it—but standing there, you feel like everyone's looking at you. Even if they aren't.\n\n The employee lets out a long, approving whistle.\n\n \"Okay, wow. Didn't think you'd actually commit. But yeah, it looks good on you. Edgy but clean.\"\n\n You give a tight-lipped smile, fidgeting with the edge of the sleeve. \"I mean it is cool. I'm just not sure if it fits me.\"\n\n Your mom looks up from her phone and blinks, clearly surprised—but not in a bad way. Just... processing. She stands, eyes scanning you from top to bottom.\n\n \"You look nice,\" she says, careful with her tone. \"It's a little different, but it doesn't look bad. Just takes some getting used to.\"\n\n You nod, unsure what else to say.\n\n You look back at the mirror. You don't hate what you see. But you're not sure if it's a door you're ready to walk through—or one you're afraid of closing.\n\n Still... maybe trying it was the point.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Her heavy boots thud softly against the floor, and it's like she's circling a piece of art she's proud of.\n\nShe finally slows to a stop beside you and tilts her head. \"So.

That's a cosmic accident.

But because something in your chest pulls back a little. It's like you're on a stage with everyone looking at you—and you realize you're not quite ready to speak.\n\n The salesgirl watches you in the mirror, her expression neutral now. Not disappointed or impatient, just... quiet. Like she's been here before.\n\n You take a deep breath. \"I think I'm gonna pass.\"\n\n \"Alright,\" she responds, not even blinking. \"Figured I'd ask. You looked like you were thinking about it.\"\n\n \"Well, I was,\" you admit. \"It's just... I don't know if it's me. Not yet.\"\n\n She nods once, and if there's any judgment, she hides it well. \"That's fair.\"\n\n When you change back into your regular clothes, they feel heavier, somehow. Or maybe you're just more aware of how neutral they are. How safe. As you exit the fitting room with the outfit neatly draped over one arm, she takes it back without a word and returns it to its hidden perch near the mannequins.\n\n Your mom is waiting by the exit again, arms folded. You can't quite read her expression, it's neither proud nor puzzled. Just curious.\n\n She raises her eyebrows as you approach. \"Not the one?\"\n\n You shake your head. \"Cool look.

It's lit by rows of overhead lights that give the place a polished vibe.\n\nYour mom follows behind you, letting you take the lead. A sales associate in a polo with the Vektix logo—an angular swoosh—nods at you with a smile.\n\nThe store is split into zones for every type of shoe: athletic shoes, clean everyday sneakers, and a section with simple, flat shoes. You wander over, drawn in by the variety.\n\nYou see the Vektix BreezeAir Lows. They're crisp white sneakers featuring delicate butterfly patterns along the sides. They're lightweight and surprisingly sleek, while being flashy enough to catch attention.\n\nYour mom raises her brows slightly. \"Those are cute,\" she says.\n\nThe next are the Vektix SwiftCharge Trainers. These look like speed incarnate. The soles have a jagged design in hot pink, with red and orange laces. They're made for movement, maybe for someone who's always in a rush.\n\nThe tag says: \"Advanced Flex Support + NeonGrip Tech\"\n\nThey look cool. Definitely a little loud, but maybe that's the point.\n\nThen, there are three flats from SomaSoft. They're simple, clean, and have no branding. They're in white, black, and brown. \n\n\"These would go with almost anything,\" your mom comments. \"You've been wearing those Converses nearly every day.\"\n\nYou sigh.\n\nFinally, tucked near the end of the display, you notice a clean, minimal pair of SeraForm Streetlace Lights. They're all white with a sleek low-top profile and a matte finish. They don't scream for attention. They're not decorated or trendy, but they are sharp.\n\n\"Those are really versatile,\" your mom says, catching the way you're eyeing them.\n\nYou glance between the styles, the soft music of the store humming behind you.

Your mom's already turning toward the mall walkway, and you follow her out, the automatic doors of StepUp sliding open behind you.\n\n As you reenter the flow of shoppers and voices and overhead music, you don't feel bad. You didn't walk out with anything new on your feet, but that doesn't matter.\n\n You did enough.\n\n \n \n You run your hand along the shoe one last time, the weight of the decision finally settling into something solid. Not pressure—just quiet certainty. These feel right.\n\n You glance over at your mom and give a small nod. \"Yeah. I'll get something.\"\n\n She smiles immediately, as if she was waiting for you to make the call on your own.\n\n The sales associate returns just in time, already holding a box like he knew. \"Great choice,\" he says with an approving nod. \"I'll ring you up at the front.\"\n\n You follow him to the register, the soft hum of the store fading slightly behind you. Your mom stands beside you, watching you pay. Once the bag is in your hand and the receipt is folded away, the associate thanks you again, and you give him a smile back.\n\n You step back out into the mall, the bag swinging lightly from your wrist.\n\n It's not a full reinvention, but it is a step.

Shirts are folded into cube shelves by size, while others hang on racks arranged by \"aesthetic\"—gothic, retro, gamer, whatever that means.\n\nA guy your age with dyed blue hair and chipped black nail polish is refolding a display nearby.

There's something oddly comforting about how messy and real it feels in this space—like it's not about fitting in, but rather about picking what makes you smile when you look in the mirror.\n\n There's one bold pink shirt with an over-the-top anime girl with the words \"GAME OVER YOU LOSE\" plastered behind her. Another one with a cone full of cartoon guinea pigs nestled in scoops like ice cream. And then there's the hoodie. Muted brown sleeves with a butterfly stretched across the chest in soft orange and black lines. It's comfy just holding it, like the kind of thing you'd throw on before heading out for late-night boba or curling up on the couch after school. The strings are slightly frayed, probably on purpose.\n\n You glance over your shoulder and catch your mom watching from near the wall of pins. She gives you a tiny thumbs-up and a smile, and it's clear she's glad you're actually trying things on.\n\n The associate nods at you from across the floor. \"Fitting rooms are down the hall—second on the right.

Just, you know, clothes and stuff.\" You laugh, but it's awkward. \"I thought... maybe you'd wanna come and hang out? No big deal or anything.\"\n\n Another pause. A soft inhale like she's smiling even if you can't see it. \"Oh. Today?\"\n\n \"Yeah. Right now, actually. If you're free, of course.\"\n\n There's that little hum—noncommital, buying time. \"Mm. Actually... I kinda have a lot going on today. Like, plans. Y'know?\"\n\n Plans. Sure. The way she says it is too easy, too practiced, like someone who's excused herself from things before.\n\n \"Right,\" you say, even though your throat feels tighter than it should. \"No worries. Just thought I'd ask.\"\n\n \"Yeah, totally. I appreciate it, though!\" she says quickly, like she needs to make it sound extra kind so you don't feel rejected. \"Maybe some other time?\"\n\n You force a laugh. \"Yeah. Some other time.\"\n\n \"Well, have fun today!\" she says with that perfectly cheerful tone, and then the line goes dead.\n\n You stare at your phone for a moment longer than necessary, like maybe she'll call you back and change her mind. Of course she doesn't. Why would she? You're not close. You're not in her world. And for some reason that you can't quite name, that stings more than it should.\n\n You toss your phone onto your bed and sit there in the quiet. Guess you'll have to go with someone else.\n\n [Choice: Ask your mom]\n [Choice: Ask your mom and Lily]\n [Choice: Ask Samantha]",

      "text": "You stare at Samantha's contact for a good ten seconds after the call with Jessica ends, the phone warm in your hand. You're not going to tell her about Jessica. You can already imagine the commentary, and you need some time before she starts grilling you about the queen bee.\n\nWith a deep breath, you press call.\n\n\"[name]?\" she answers immediately, like she's been waiting for a reason to pounce. \"Is this a real call that you initiated, or am I hallucinating? You gonna start mailing handwritten letters? Blink twice if you've been replaced by an alien.\"\n\nYou roll your eyes, flopping backward onto your bed. \"Hi to you too.\"\n\n\"Uh-oh,\" she says, instantly suspicious. \"You have that voice. The one that means you're about to ask me for something.\"\n\n\"I do not have a voice.\"\n\n\"You totally do,\" she shoots back. \"Spill it.\"\n\nYou exhale, smiling despite yourself. \"Do you still wanna go shopping today?\"\n\nThere's a beat of silence, then: \"Oh my God. Did you just accept my offer? Did I win? Are you okay? Do I need to check your temperature?\"\n\n\"I'm perfectly fine.\"\n\n\"I don't think you are. This is a huge day. This is, like, bigger than your birthday. Hold on, let me write this in my diary: 'Today, [name] finally admitted his wardrobe is a war crime.'\"\n\nYou groan. \"Sam—\"\n\n\"No, no, this is important,\" she interrupts, all mock-seriousness now. \"Today, we put an end to the White T-Shirt and Cargo Shorts Era. Generations will speak of this.\"\n\nYou think about what you've worn the past few years—white T-shirt, cargo shorts, socks with holes in them—and mutter, \"They're comfortable.\"\n\n\"They're an abomination,\" she corrects without missing a beat. \"But don't worry. Redemption begins today. Where are we going first? Do you want, like, a whole new aesthetic? Skater, maybe. I'm thinking layers. People who know fashion always wear layers.\"\n\n\"Can we just start with something that's not embarrassing?\"\n\n\"Oh, we're going way beyond that,\" she says, and you can practically hear the grin in her voice. \"I want people to look at you and think, 'Wow, he has layers. Emotionally and literally.'\"\n\nYou try to groan, but end up laughing. \"This was a mistake.\"\n\n\"You're damn right it was, but you're stuck with me now.\" Her voice dips, just for a moment, into something more genuine. \"Seriously, though, I'm glad you're coming. I know you were on the fence.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" you say. \"I just thought it might be good to get out.\"\n\n\"Understatement of the year,\" she says. \"We're gonna make a whole day out of it. I'll be judgement-free... well, mostly so. I promise to only make fun of you when you deserve it.\"\n\n\"So all the time?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" she says. \"Anyway, give me twenty minutes. Prepare yourself. This is gonna be fun.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Sam.\"\n\nThere's a pause. \"Hey,\" she says, tone suddenly softer. \"You're actually letting me help with something. I'm not gonna make fun of that.\"\n\n\"You literally already are.\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure, but like, lovingly,\" she corrects. \"That's different.\"\n\nYou smile into the phone. \"Right.\"\n\n\"See you soon, Captain Cargo Shorts.\"\n\nYou laugh, shaking your head as the call clicks off.\n\nYour room feels lighter somehow. Between Samantha's chaotic excitement and Jessica actually agreeing to come, it feels like today might actually be good. You set the phone on your chest, staring up at the ceiling.\n\nThis is happening.\n\nYou're going shopping.\n\nAnd for the first time in a while, you're actually kind of looking forward to it.\n\n[Choice: Let Mom know]",

      "text": "The moment the store door closes behind you, the atmosphere changes completely. It's warmer inside than the mall corridor, tinged with floral perfume and a soft trace of vanilla that seems baked into the walls. The lighting is low and warm, the kind that makes everything look softer, slower. Even the way the displays are arranged feels intentional—gentle and careful, like the whole place is trying to wrap you in a quiet hug.\n\nLace and cotton bralettes line the walls in neat pastel rows, some folded, some hung. A few mannequins stand nearby in coordinated sets, posed like they know exactly what they're doing here.\n\nJessica walks ahead, her stride as easy as if she's been here a dozen times. She glances back at you with an encouraging smile. \"See? Not so scary,\" she says softly, holding the door open for Samantha, who saunters in like she owns the place.\n\n\"This is cozy,\" Samantha remarks, glancing around. \"I could live here. Way better than those nightmare stores with blinding lights.\"\n\nYou hang back a step, feeling awkward among so many soft, delicate displays. Every mannequin seems to be judging you for not belonging, but Jessica catches your hesitation and says, \"You belong here just as much as anyone else.\"\n\nBehind the counter stands a woman in her late twenties, sleek hair pulled into a bun, sorting neatly wrapped hangers into bins. Her nametag reads Riley. She looks up when she notices you, and her face brightens into an easy smile.\n\n\"Hi there,\" Riley says, setting the last hanger aside and walking around the counter. \"What brings you in today?\"\n\nYou open your mouth, but Jessica jumps in with practiced ease. \"We're here to get our friend fitted. First time.\" She gestures at you.\n\nRiley nods as if she hears this every day, her expression never flickering into anything but warm professionalism. \"Of course,\" she says. \"We'll just get some measurements and bring out a few starter styles. Nothing too tight or loose, nothing itchy. Comfort is the priority.\"\n\nYou nod, the tension in your chest loosening slightly at her tone.\n\n\"Perfect,\" Jessica says. \"We're looking for something soft. Wireless, maybe. Something that can be worn under pretty much anything.\"\n\n\"Got it,\" Riley says, already motioning for you to follow. \"We've got everything here. Let me know if there are any fabrics or styles you absolutely hate. Or even any that you like. Do you have any preferences?\"\n\nYou shake your head, unsure where to even start.\n\nSamantha steps in. \"What about those ones that feel like you're wearing clouds but actually keep everything in place? For a very particular person whose back deserves kindness.\"\n\nYou shoot her a look. \"You mean me.\"\n\nShe gives you a wide-eyed, innocent grin. \"I would never name names.\"\n\nRiley chuckles and stops in front of a row of fitting room doors, each with a tiny sign hung from the hook outside. Thankfully, all of them are empty.\n\n\"This one's open and good to go,\" she says, opening up a door to reveal a cozy space inside—cream-colored walls, lighting that doesn't feel cruel, a plush bench, and a mirror.\n\nYou hover in the doorway, heart beating a little faster. It's just a fitting room, but there's something strange about stepping into this space. Like you're crossing a line you can't uncross.\n\nJessica notices the hesitation and touches your arm lightly. \"Hey,\" she says softly. \"It's okay. You're not doing this alone. We're right here.\"\n\nSamantha steps up beside her, leaning in just enough so that nobody can eavesdrop. \"Yeah. Look, this can be weird the first time, but you don't have to do it solo if you don't want to.\"\n\nJessica tilts her head toward the fitting room, giving you that warm reassuring smile again. \"I can come in with you, help you figure out what you like.\"\n\n\"Or I can,\" Samantha adds quickly. \"Keep it simple.\"\n\n\"I mean, if you want it, both of us can come in,\" Jessica says smoothly. \"Whatever makes you most comfortable. No pressure either way.\"\n\nThe door is in front of you, the little fitting room waiting.\n\nAnd now... it's up to you.\n\n[Choice: Go in alone]\n[Choice: Ask for Samantha to come with you]\n[Choice: Ask for Jessica to come with you]\n[Choice: Ask for Samantha and Jessica to come with you]",

      "text": "You take a deep breath, staring at the softly lit fitting room. The weight of their offers lingers, but in the end, you shake your head.\n\n \"I think I need to do this alone,\" you say quietly, glancing between them. \"I appreciate it. Really. But I think it'll be better if I just... figure it out myself first.\"\n\n \"Of course,\" Jessica says, her expression softening immediately. \"Take your time. We'll be right out here if you need anything.\"\n\n Samantha gives you a short nod. \"Yeah. Yell if you need me to make jokes at your expense to break the tension.\"\n\n You manage a small smile at that, and it seems to put both of them at ease.\n\n Jessica steps back, giving you space. \"You've got this.\"\n\n With a final steadying breath, you step into the fitting room. The door closes softly closed behind you, leaving you alone in the quiet, warm little space.\n\n \n \n You pull your top off slowly, already feeling the pressure from the tight, black binder beneath it. It clings to your chest, compressing everything into place like armor. It's familiar, and you've been relying on it for a while now. It works for the most part.\n\n But standing under this soft lighting, in this space that's supposed to be about fit and comfort, the way the binder presses into your ribs, suddenly feeling too sharp. Too restrictive. You twist side to side, stretching a little, wincing as the fabric digs in.\n\n You catch your reflection in the mirror. The binder gives you shape, or rather, takes shape away. But it also takes ease with it.\n\n You don't hate it, but you're not sure if you want to keep wearing something that hurts to feel okay.\n \n \n You tug your top over your head slowly, wincing as the rough knot of fabric digs into your ribs. The towel you've wrapped around your chest is tight—too tight—but it's the only thing you have.\n\n As you undo the makeshift binding, the pressure lifts suddenly, leaving behind a dull ache and a faint red mark.\n\n You look at yourself in the mirror and feel both exposed and strangely relieved. The towel was always a temporary solution. You knew that. It was never meant to last, it was just supposed to get you here.\n \n \n \n \n Your shirt comes off easily, the fabric light over your still-flat chest. There's no curve to hide. Your torso is smooth and angular, the way it's always been, even as everything else seems to keep shifting around you.\n\n You glance at your reflection, expecting to feel small. But you don't. Not quite.\n\n You don't need a bra for support, at least not yet. But you're here anyway, and it never hurts to get one just in case.\n \n \n You lift your top and tug it off in one smooth motion, revealing the snug band of your sports bra underneath. It's plain, and was a gift from someone who thought you'd need it. It does the job, pressing down just enough that you don't think about it too much during the day.\n\n You glance at the mirror and run your fingers under the band. It's not uncomfortable, but it's not great either. It's... functional. But you want comfortable.\n \n \n You pull your shirt over your head slowly, revealing your bare chest underneath. You don't have a bra, or a binder, or anything. Your breasts are soft and visible, a quiet presence that's been increasingly harder to ignore.\n\n You came here for a reason. To stop pretending this isn't happening and to be comfortable. Maybe it's time to stop pretending that real is something to be afraid of.\n \n \n \n There's a gentle knock on the door.\n\n \"Hey, it's Riley,\" comes her calm voice. \"Ready for me to come in for the fitting?\"\n\n You swallow, barely managing a quiet, \"Yeah.\"\n\n The door opens and Riley steps inside with a soft smile and a flexible measuring tape looped around her neck. She closes the door gently behind her, moving with a practiced confidence. It's clear she's done this a thousand times and isn't about to make it weird.\n\n \"No stress,\" she says lightly. \"It'll just be two quick measurements—should only take a second. Relax your arms for me?\"\n\n You nod and stand a little straighter, heart fluttering just beneath your skin.\n\n \n Riley starts with the band measurement—firm but gentle as she wraps the tape beneath your chest. Then she moves upward, looping it carefully around the fullest part of your chest.\n\n You feel the heat in your cheeks rise. There is definitely no hiding the size now.\n\n Riley finishes and pulls back with a nod.\n\n \"You're measuring at a 36B,\" she says. \"That means you'll probably want medium support—something with shaping, maybe a soft underwire. But there's no pressure to go structured unless you want it.\"\n\n You blink. \"B?\" you repeat in a whisper.\n\n \"Yep,\" she says, unfazed. \"That's totally normal. You don't have to hide anything, but you don't have to show anything either. Just choose what feels right to you.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you murmur. \"That... helps.\"\n \n \n Riley wraps the measuring tape beneath your chest first, the soft edge resting against your ribs. She calls out the band size, then moves it upward, gently looping it across the curve of your chest. There's just enough pressure to feel, not enough to squeeze.\n\n You can't help noticing how much more there is than there used to be.\n\n She just reads the number, pulls back, and smiles.\n\n \"You're a 34A,\" she says. \"Which means you've got some shape but you're still in the lighter support zone. I'll bring you soft cups, maybe one with some lining if you're curious about it.\"\n\n You nod, arms hovering awkwardly at your sides.\n\n \"You've got options here,\" she adds. \"You don't have to hide anything, but you don't have to show anything either. Just choose what feels right to you.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you murmur. \"That... helps.\"\n \n \n Riley steps in front of you and wraps the measuring tape around your ribcage, right beneath your chest. It settles there without any resistance—just skin and bone, no curve to measure. She calls out a quiet number under her breath before shifting the tape upward across the flattest part of your chest.\n \n \"Alright,\" she says, straightening. \"You're measuring around a 32AA. That puts you in a flat-fit or soft bralette category. Just something comfortable and light.\"\n\n You nod, exhaling slowly.\n \n\n \n You take a breath, staring at the softly lit fitting room, then glance between the two of them.\n\n \"I think I'd like Samantha to come in with me,\" you say, your voice quieter than you expected. \"If that's okay.\"\n\n Jessica doesn't miss a beat. Her expression stays warm and understanding. \"Of course,\" she says softly, nodding. \"Whatever makes you comfortable. I'll be right out here.\"\n\n Samantha gives you a little smirk. \"See? Knew I was the comforting part.\"\n\n You manage a faint laugh at that.\n\n Jessica steps back to give you space, flashing you a supportive smile. \"You've got this. Take your time.\"\n\n With that, you step into the fitting room, Samantha slipping in behind you. The door closes shut, blocking out the soft hum of the store and leaving you in the quiet, warm little space together.\n\n \n \n You pull your top up and over your head, the fabric catching slightly at the shoulders before slipping off. The air in the fitting room feels cooler against your skin. Underneath, the snug compression fabric clings close—flattening everything into a shape that almost passes for what you used to look like.\n\n You've gotten used to it—how it limits your movement, how it hugs too tight under your arms—but standing here, under soft lights, it suddenly feels more obvious\n\n Samantha exhales low, eyes flicking to it, then to your face. \"Okay,\" she says, tone unreadable for a second. Then it softens. \"So you have been dealing with this on hard mode.\"\n\n You don't say anything at first. She crosses her arms and leans against the wall.\n\n \"Well, it's done its job,\" she says after a beat. \"But we're absolutely getting you out of that thing and into something that doesn't feel like a medieval chest trap.\"\n\n You manage a weak smile. \"I'm used to it.\"\n\n \"Doesn't mean you should have to be,\" she replies, and there's no sarcasm in her voice this time—just her, steady and present. \"Let's find you something that lets you breathe.\"\n \n \n The shirt peels off awkwardly, catching a little where it's tucked into the towel wrapped tight around your chest. It's fraying near the edge, the knot in the back tied just right to hold firm but not cut off your circulation—hopefully.\n\n It's not elegant. Not safe. Just what you have.\n\n Samantha stares for a second, blinking. Then her expression twists, eyebrows shooting up, mouth already halfway to a word that dies before it's fully formed.\n\n \"...That's a towel,\" she says, pointing like she's spotted a health code violation in a restaurant.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you mutter, avoiding her eyes. \"I didn't have anything else.\"\n\n She takes a breath, tapping her foot. \"Okay. First of all—creative. Truly. But also? [name]. Bestie. No.\"\n\n You almost laugh at the string of emotions—somewhere between horrified and disappointed.\n\n \"You wrapped a towel around yourself like a snack burrito. No wonder you've been walking weird.\"\n\n You shrug. \"It worked.\"\n\n \"Sure. And I could use duct tape as eyeliner, and it would work, but that doesn't mean I should.\"\n\n She looks at you again, really looks, and her voice dips a little. \"Let's get you something that won't try to suffocate you, yeah?\"\n\n You nod, and she grins faintly. \"That's what I thought.\"\n \n \n \n \n You lift your shirt up and over your head in one smooth motion. The air hits your skin—cool, comfortable. There's nothing underneath—no compression, no support gear. Just... you.\n\n And despite everything, your chest is still flat. Still unchanged.\n\n Samantha watches for a second, her expression unreadable. Then she blinks. \"Huh.\"\n\n \"What?\"\n\n \"You know, I was ready for, like, something dramatic. Some boobs, I don't know. But you're just...\" She gestures vaguely. \"Still doing your thing.\"\n\n You glance at your reflection.\n\n \"I guess I haven't changed much. Not there, anyway.\"\n\n Samantha nods. \"Hey, that's fine. Not a problem, just... good to know. Means we don't have to go full support mode today, but we can still get you something soft and comfy. Never hurts to have options.\"\n\n You tilt your head. \"You're not gonna make me try on lace?\"\n\n \"I'm not that much of a monster,\" she says, scoffing. \"I was thinking cotton. Maybe in beige.\"\n\n You laugh—and it actually feels easy.\n \n \n You peel off your top, slow and careful. Underneath, the sports bra clings to you—simple, black, no-frills. It's stretched out in places and not exactly made for... what you've got now, but it does the job. Mostly.\n\n The straps dig in a little. It's fine. You've dealt with worse.\n\n Samantha's eyes flick over it once, then she lets out a breath like she's been holding it since you walked in. \"Okay. that's something. Functional. Practical. Slightly tragic.\"\n\n You shoot her a look. \"It was free.\"\n\n \"Let me guess—hand-me-down from someone who runs track and doesn't believe in labels?\"\n\n You smirk. \"Something like that.\"\n\n She steps closer and tugs gently at one strap, then lets it snap back. \"That thing's probably older than both of us. You deserve better.\"\n\n \"It works.\"\n\n \"Yeah, but so do rotary phones and VHS tapes,\" she says. \"Doesn't mean we're gonna bring them back.\"\n\n She gives your shoulder a quick, reassuring nudge. \"Let's upgrade you to something that doesn't scream 2008.\"\n \n \n You pull off your top slowly, suddenly hyper-aware of every movement, every shift in fabric. Your chest is bare underneath—no binder, no layers, no protection. Just skin, soft and real, and no longer something you can ignore or hide.\n\n The cool air touches you differently now. You feel exposed. Not in a bad way, just... raw.\n\n You don't look at the mirror right away. You don't look at Samantha either.\n\n She's quiet for a beat, then her voice comes, gentler than you expected.\n\n \"Okay. Wow.\"\n\n You brace yourself.\n\n \"Look at you,\" she says, not teasing. Not laughing. Just... observing. \"Walking around like this isn't a big deal. That's some grade-A bravery.\"\n\n You finally glance at her. She's not gawking. Just watching. There's a softness in her eyes, like she's been handed something fragile and knows better than to squeeze.\n\n You try to joke. \"Figured I'd let gravity take the wheel.\"\n\n She snorts. \"Gravity's rude. We'll find you something that fights back.\"\n\n Then she adds, quieter. \"And something that makes you feel okay looking at yourself.\"\n\n You nod, slowly. A little unsteady. But glad she's here.\n\n She flashes you a half-grin. \"Alright. Let's get measured and fix this.\"\n \n \n\n There's a soft knock on the fitting room door—two quick raps, light and practiced.\n\n \"Hey,\" comes Riley's voice from the other side, calm and warm. \"You two ready for me to come in?\"\n\n You look up, startled out of your own thoughts. The mirror catches the faint tension in your shoulders, the way your fingers are still curled loosely at your sides.\n\n Samantha, sitting cross-legged on the bench now, glances at you instead of the door. Her voice is quieter than usual, but still unmistakably her. \"Are you?\"\n\n You nod once, steadying your breath. \"Yeah. I'm ready.\"\n\n She nods back like that settles it.\n\n \"Come on in,\" she calls toward the door.\n\n The knob turns gently, and Riley steps inside with the kind of ease that makes you feel like she's done this a hundred times before—because she has. She doesn't make a show of looking around, doesn't blink twice at Samantha sitting on the bench or at you standing by the mirror.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says, smile still soft. \"Thanks for waiting. We'll take this one step at a time, okay? Nothing uncomfortable, and you can stop me whenever.\"\n\n You nod again, and Riley closes the door behind her with a quiet click.\n\n She pulls a measuring tape from around her neck and straightens slightly, giving you just enough space without feeling distant.\n\n \"Let's start with a few easy measurements,\" she says gently. \"You can just relax.\"\n\n You try.\n\n \n Riley steps closer, her hands steady and sure as she unwraps the measuring tape and gently loops it around your back.\n\n \"Alright, just breathe normally,\" she says, her tone even and calm. \"This part's quick.\"\n\n You feel the cool fabric of the tape slide beneath your arms and across your chest. It presses snugly for a moment, not tight, just enough to make you hyper-aware of your shape—of how much there is now.\n\n Riley's eyes flick to the numbers, then she adjusts slightly, measuring again just under your bust.\n\n \"Okay,\" she says with a small nod. \"Looks like a 36 band... and about a B cup. Pretty balanced fit overall.\"\n\n You freeze a little at that. Hearing it spoken aloud makes it feel real in a new way. Not theoretical. Not just your reflection. Something measurable. Defined.\n\n Riley meets your eyes briefly and offers a smile that doesn't feel patronizing. \"Nothing out of the ordinary. Super common size. We've got tons of comfy options for this range.\"\n\n From the bench, Samantha nods like she already knew. \"See? I told you you'd have good proportions.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but you're grateful.\n \n \n The measuring tape glides under your arms and across your chest like a ribbon, cool against your skin. Riley works quickly but gently, adjusting the tape at your back, then again along your bust.\n\n \"Just breathe easy,\" she murmurs. \"Almost done.\"\n\n There's a short pause as she checks the number.\n\n \"Looks like a 34 band,\" she says, adjusting slightly and nodding. \"And just about an A cup. A classic starting point.\"\n\n You shift slightly on your feet, uncertain whether to be relieved or embarrassed.\n\n Riley seems to pick up on it. \"Totally normal, by the way. Bodies develop at different speeds. A cup sizes are super easy to shop for, and a lot of our softer styles are built with this in mind.\"\n\n Samantha hums. \"A-plus for the A-cup,\" she says, tapping at the bench with her fingers. \"We're officially in starter bra territory.\"\n\n You huff a quiet laugh and don't quiet meet her eye, but you don't feel as nervous now.\n \n \n Riley steps in, guiding the tape around your torso with quiet efficiency. It sits flat against your skin—there's nothing to press into, nothing to measure in curves. Just a shape you've always known.\n\n She reads the numbers, her voice calm. \"32 band,\" she says, making a small adjustment, double-checking. \"And about an AA cup.\"\n\n You nod faintly. That's about what you expected. Still, hearing it spoken aloud feels... odd. Like something that doesn't quite match everything else you've been going through.\n\n But Riley doesn't flinch, doesn't blink.\n\n \"That's totally valid,\" she says, as if reading your thoughts. \"Some folks stay here. Some don't. Either way, there are great pieces that'll feel comfortable and still give you coverage or shape if that's what you're after.\"\n\n Samantha leans forward from the bench. \"So basically: we're in comfy bralette territory. Minimalist. Clean. Iconic.\"\n\n You smile, just a little. \"Sounds manageable.\"\n\n Riley nods, already jotting things down. \"Let's find you something that fits just right.\"\n \n\n \n You take a steadying breath, staring at the softly lit fitting room, then glance between them.\n\n \"I... think I'd like Jessica to come in with me,\" you say, the words coming out quieter than you expected.\n\n For a moment, Samantha blinks, but then she shrugs, her expression relaxed. \"Yeah, of course. Whatever makes you comfortable.\" She steps back, stuffing her hands into her pockets. \"I'll be out here. Go team or whatever.\"\n\n Jessica offers you a soft, reassuring smile. \"Alright. Let's do this together, then.\"\n\n The ease in her tone makes it feel a little less daunting, and you nod, following her as she steps into the fitting room with you.\n\n The door closes shut behind you, sealing off the sounds of the store and leaving you in the quiet, softly lit space together.\n\n \n \n You take a moment to steady yourself, then hook your fingers under the hem of your top and pull it over your head. The air in the fitting room feels warm against your skin, and you can't help but glance away from the mirror as your binder comes into view—tight, stretched a little more than it should be, the fabric digging faintly into your skin where it presses hardest. There are faint red lines where the edges have been digging in, marks you've gotten used to ignoring.\n\n Jessica stands a step back, arms loosely folded, but her posture changes when she sees it. Her shoulders sink a little, her lips press together, and she lets out a soft sigh.\n\n \"[name],\" she says quietly, her voice so gentle it makes your chest tighten in a whole new way, \"does that hurt?\"\n\n You hesitate, staring at the floor before nodding. \"Yeah, it does. Kind of all the time, actually. Especially after wearing it for a while.\"\n\n Jessica frowns. \"That's not okay,\" she says, her tone still soft but frimer now, like she needs you to hear it. \"We're going to find you something better. You deserve to feel supported without feeling like you're... trapped.\"\n \n \n You pull your shirt over your head, and the air in the fitting room feels heavier somehow. The knotted towel across your chest is wound so tight it's biting into your skin, leaving angry red lines along your ribs and shoulders. The skin near the knot is rubbed raw, the marks deep enough that even you can't ignore how bad they look.\n\n Jessica freezes when she sees it, her usual warmth gone in an instant, replaced by a firm edge. \"[name],\" she says, voice low and steady, \"this isn't okay.\"\n\n \"It's just a towel,\" you say, ashamed. \"I didn't have anything else.\"\n\n \"That doesn't make it any better,\" Jessica says, her jaw tightening. \"Look at your skin. You're seriously hurting yourself.\"\n\n You try to shrug it off. \"It helps me feel better. Like I can deal with—\"\n\n \"No,\" she interrupts, not harshly, but with a weight that makes you stop. \"Not like this. This isn't safe, and you don't deserve to be in pain just to exist.\"\n\n Her expression softens slightly, though her voice stays firm. \"We're gonna get you something better. Today. No arguments.\"\n\n It doesn't sound like a suggestion. It sounds like a promise.\n \n \n \n \n You pull your shirt over your head, the soft lighting of the fitting room washing over your bare skin. There's nothing there—no bra, no binder, just your chest as it is, flat and unremarkable.\n\n Jessica takes it in for a second before speaking. \"Okay,\" she says gently. \"That makes sense.\"\n\n \"What do you mean?\" you ask, glancing at her uncertainly.\n\n \"I mean, I get why you didn't think about wearing anything before. But even if you don't need support right now, a bra or bralette can still help. It makes clothes fit smoother, gives you a bit more comfort, especially with certain tops.\"\n\n Her tone stays casual, like this is the most normal conversation in the world. \"Nothing fancy. Just something soft and easy. Let's find you something that feels right.\"\n\n There's no judgment in her voice, just quiet reassurance.\n \n \n You pull your shirt over your head, the soft lighting of the fitting room making everything feel a little more exposed than it actually is. Underneath, you've got a plain black sports bra—functional, but clearly not made for you. The straps are a little too loose, and the band looks like it digs in more than it should.\n\n Jessica tilts her head, taking it in without a hint of judgment. \"Okay,\" she says softly. \"That's not bad, I guess.\"\n\n You glance at her, unsure how to take that. \"Not bad?\"\n\n She smiles gently. \"Yeah. It's doing its job, sure, but it's not really made for you, is it? The fit's off. You deserve something that actually feels comfortable. Something that's not just a stand-in.\"\n\n \"This doesn't have to be complicated,\" she says with a little grin. \"We'll find you something that feels right. Deal?\"\n\n The way she says it is simple, but somehow it makes the whole thing feel less intimidating.\n \n \n You take a breath and pull your shirt over your head. Your chest is there, very noticeable now, with nothing to support it. You cross your arms over it without thinking.\n\n \"[name]... you really are going to need one,\" Jessica says, her tone firm.\n\n \"I've been fine without it,\" you mutter, though it sounds weak even to you.\n\n \"Have you been fine, or just ignoring it?\"\n\n You hesitate. \"Well, it is uncomfortable sometimes. Especially when I'm moving around or going down the stairs.\"\n\n \"Exactly,\" Jessica says, nodding. \"This isn't about how things look, it's about support and feeling good in your body. You don't need to tough it out.\"\n\n You glance at the mirror. \"I don't even know where to start with this.\"\n\n \"That's why I'm here,\" she says, smile softening. \"Let's get you something that actually works.\"\n \n \n\n A soft knock breaks the quiet hum of the fitting room.\n\n \"Hey,\" Riley's voice comes gently from the other side of the door. \"Are you two doing alright in there? Ready for me to come in?\"\n\n You stiffen instinctively, glancing toward Jessica. The air feels thicker all of a sudden, the simple act of saying \"yes\" looming over you.\n\n Jessica notices your hesitation immediately. She gets in front of you so she's in your line of sight, her voice soft but steady. \"Hey. You're okay,\" she says. \"Measurements are the easy part. She does this every single day. Nothing weird, nothing uncomfortable. And I'll be right here the whole time.\"\n\n You let out a shaky breath, staring at the door like it's some kind of threshold. \"I just... don't know what to expect.\"\n\n \"That's fair,\" Jessica says gently. \"But Riley's good at this. She's done it a million times. She's not here to judge you, she just wants to make sure whatever you end up with actually fits you and feels good. That's all.\"\n\n Her words are grounding in a way you didn't realize you needed. You nod slowly, still nervous but steadier. \"Okay,\" you say finally, your voice just loud enough to carry through the door. \"Yeah. We're ready.\"\n\n The handle turns, and Riley steps inside with an easy smile, closing the door behind her. She doesn't rush, doesn't make a show of looking around. Her gaze stays on you, warm but professional.\n\n \"Perfect,\" she says. \"We'll start simple with a few quick measurements to get a sense of size. You don't have to do anything but stand still. Try to relax, okay?\"\n\n You nod, heart still pounding.\n\n \n Riley gives you a reassuring nod as she positions the tape under your bust. \"Just keep your arms relaxed. Perfect.\" Her tone is calm, the kind that makes it easier not to overthink what's happening. She pulls the tape snug—not too tight—notes the number, then moves it higher, measuring around your chest. \"Alright, one more adjustment. There we go.\"\n\n She steps back, scribbling something quickly onto her notepad before looking up with a warm, easy smile. \"You're measuring at about a 36B,\" she says. \"That's a really versatile size, which means we've got a ton of options to work with. We can go for supportive pieces that feel light and flexible, or keep it super simple.\"\n\n You let out a slow breath, feeling oddly grounded now that you actually have a number to work with. \"So... that's pretty normal, right?\"\n\n \"Very much so,\" Jessica says, grinning. \"You'd be very surprised by how common that size is. We're going to find something great.\"\n \n \n Riley loops the measuring tape around you with practiced ease, her movements efficient but gentle. \"Stand nice and relaxed,\" she says. \"If you hold your breath, it can throw the number off a little.\" You exhale, letting your shoulders loosen as she takes the first measurement just beneath your chest, then shifts the tape up higher. \"Great, hold still. Almost done.\"\n\n \"Alright,\" she says with a small smile. She steps back and jots down a few quick notes. \"You're measuring at about a 34A. That's a great starting point. You'll have plenty of options. It's about finding what feels right.\"\n\n \"That's not too small or anything?\" you ask, nervously shifting a little on your feet.\n\n Jessica shakes her head before Riley can even answer. \"Not at all. That's like the 'welcome to options' size,\" she says brightly. \"Seriously, you're gonna have a ton of choices.\"\n \n \n Riley crouches slightly to get the tape in place, the cool fabric brushing lightly against ribs as she works. \"Alright,\" she says calmly, \"I'm going to start under the bust first.\" Her voice is steady and professional, the kind of tone that makes it easy to breathe. She checks the fit, adjusts it once, then notes the number on a small pad. \"Okay, now just lift your arms for me. Perfect.\" She moves the tape higher, around the fullest part of your chest, and gives another small nod.\n\n \"Looks like you're measuring at about a 32AA,\" she says. \"That's on the smaller end, which actually gives us some flexibility. That puts you in a flat-fit or soft bralette category. Just something comfortable and light.\"\n\n You blink at her, trying to process the numbers, then glance over at Jessica.\n\n Jessica pushes off the wall, her smile reassuring. \"See? That wasn't bad at all. And now we know exactly where to start.\"\n \n\n \n You hover at the fitting room doorway, staring inside like it's some kind of threshold you're not sure you're ready to cross. Jessica waits patiently just beside you, hands clasped loosely in front of her, while Samantha leans against the wall.\n\n \"Actually, could you both come in with me?\" you say, glancing between the two of them.\n\n Jessica offers a warm smile without a moment's hesitation. \"Of course,\" she says.\n\n Samantha straightens, eyebrows lifting as she steps closer. \"Both of us? Alright,\" she says, peeking past you into the room. She tilts her head, taking in the narrow space. \"Might be a little crowded, but we can make it work.\"\n\n You huff out a nervous laugh, stepping aside so they can follow you in. Samantha pushes the door gently with her shoulder as she slips past, scanning the room. \"Wow. Luxury. As I said, only the best for you.\"\n\n Jessica chuckles lightly, moving to stand near the wall opposite the mirror. She's careful to give you space while still staying close enough to feel present. She folds her arms, not in the way Samantha does, but in a relaxed, grounding stance that makes the room feel less intimidating.\n\n Samantha drops onto the bench, leans back against the wall, and lets her foot tap idly against the floor. \"Alright,\" she says, spreading her hands in an exaggerated gesture. \"Stage is yours, [name]. Showtime.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but the joking is enough to ease the knot in your chest just a little.\n \n Jessica nods toward the mirror. \"Take your time,\" she says softly. \"We're not going anywhere.\"\n\n You nod, finally slipping all the way in. The three of you shuffle slightly to make the cramped space work, and Samantha reaches to push the door closed with a soft click.\n\n The three of you are now sealed off from the rest of the store, the outside world fading away into the quiet little room.\n\n \n \n You take a moment to steady yourself, then hook your fingers under the hem of your top and pull it over your head. The air in the fitting room feels warm against your skin, and you can't help but glance away from the mirror as your binder comes into view—tight, stretched a little more than it should be, the fabric digging faintly into your skin where it presses hardest. There are faint red lines where the edges have been digging in, marks you've gotten used to ignoring.\n\n There's silence for a moment, heavy and tense.\n\n Then, Samantha breaks it, her voice sharper than usual. \"Dude,\" she says flatly, sitting forward on the bench, elbows on her knees. \"Are you serious? You've been wearing that?\"\n\n You glance back at her, startled by the edge in her tone. \"Yeah. It's just a binder I got. It's fine.\"\n\n \"Fine?\" she repeats, incredulous. \"It's literally digging into you. That's not fine, [name].\"\n\n Jessica steps in before Samantha can go further, but her voice isn't any softer. It's calm, sure, but there's a gravity to it that makes your stomach twist. \"[name], it's not supposed to hurt you. And looking at those marks?\" She gestures toward your ribs, her face pained. \"It clearly is.\"\n\n \"We are not letting you walk out of here without fixing this,\" Samantha says, letting out a frustrated breath.\n \n \n You peel off your top, and the air in the small room feels instantly heavier. The knotted towel across your chest is wound so tight it's biting into your skin, leaving angry red lines along your ribs and shoulders. The skin near the knot is rubbed raw, the marks deep enough that even you can't ignore how bad they look.\n\n Samantha sits forward so sharply the bench creaks. \"Oh my fucking God,\" she blurts, staring at you. \"I knew you said you were using a towel, but—that? Are you out of your mind?!\"\n\n Jessica's face hardens, her voice low and serious in a way you don't often hear from her. \"[name]... this isn't just bad. It's dangerous. You can't keep doing this to yourself.\"\n \n \"It works,\" you mumble weakly. \"I just didn't think it was a big deal.\"\n\n \"Not a big deal?\" Samantha snaps. \"That thing is digging into you.\"\n\n Jessica exhales, a little softer now but no less firm. \"She's right. You don't deserve to hurt just to feel okay. We're fixing this today.\"\n\n You glance at the angry red lines across your skin, and you can't argue back.\n \n \n \n \n You pull your shirt over your head, the soft lighting of the fitting room washing over your bare skin. There's nothing there—no bra, no binder, just your chest as it is, flat and unremarkable.\n\n Samantha tilts her head. \"Oh,\" she says after a beat, leaning back on the bench. \"Okay. I mean... I guess that makes sense why you haven't been wearing anything. I expected some dramatic boob reveal.\"\n\n \"Yeah. If you're flat like this, I get why it didn't feel like a priority,\" Jessica says, giving you a small, understanding smile. Then she adds, \"But even then, a little support or shaping wouldn't hurt. It can make clothes sit better, and honestly? It can just feel nice.\"\n\n Samantha nods. \"Yeah, something light. Doesn't have to be serious. Just... you know, not literally nothing.\"\n\n \"I never really thought about it that way,\" you murmur.\n\n \"That's what we're here for,\" Jessica shrugs. \"Doesn't have to be complicated. Just something that feels good to wear.\"\n\n \"And doesn't look like you just rolled out of bed and grabbed a shirt,\" Samantha comments.\n\n You roll your eyes, but you can't help smiling a little.\n \n \n You pull your shirt over your head, the soft lighting of the fitting room making everything feel a little more exposed than it actually is. Underneath, you've got a plain black sports bra—functional, but clearly not made for you. The straps are a little too loose, and the band looks like it digs in more than it should.\n\n Jessica tilts her head, taking it in without a hint of judgment. \"Okay,\" she says softly. \"That's not bad, I guess. But still... this isn't really your size, is it?\"\n\n You shrug awkwardly. \"Someone gave it to me. It works well enough.\"\n\n \"'Well enough' shouldn't leave you constantly adjusting it,\" Jessica says gently. \"We can do better. Something actually meant for you.\"\n\n Samantha, still lounging on the bench, raises an eyebrow. \"A hand-me-down sports bra. Truly the height of fashion.\"\n\n You give her a flat look. \"Thanks, Sam.\"\n\n \"What?\" Sam asks, feigning ignorance. \"I'm just saying, if bras could talk, that one would be screaming for retirement.\"\n\n Jessica shoots her a look but can't quite suppress a smile. \"She's not wrong,\" she admits, then turns back to you with a reassuring tone. \"We'll find you something comfortable. Something you don't have to fight with every time you wear it.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"I guess that'd be nice.\"\n\n \"Nice?\" Samantha grins. \"Buddy, you're about to level up.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but somehow, Samantha's comments make the whole thing feel a little less embarrassing.\n \n \n You take a breath and pull your shirt over your head. Your chest is there, very noticeable now, with nothing to support it. You cross your arms over it without thinking.\n\n Samantha's eyebrows shoot up first. \"Oh, wow,\" she says bluntly, leaning forward on the bench. \"Okay, yeah. You seriously need a bra. Like yesterday.\"\n\n \"She's right,\" Jessica says, stepping a little closer, her tone careful but serious. \"Going without support isn't just uncomfortable—it can mess with your posture, your back, even development over time. You can't just leave them unsupported like this.\"\n\n You rub the back of your neck, embarrassed. \"I mean... it has been uncomfortable,\" you admit. \"Especially when I'm, like, going down stairs. That sucks.\"\n\n Jessica gives you a sympathetic look. \"That's exactly what I mean. You shouldn't have to put up with that. You need proper support.\"\n\n \"Samantha Rivera's official diagnosis: get a bra,\" she says, pointing at you like she's delivering a verdict. \"We're making that happen today.\"\n\n \"Guess I don't get a say in this, huh?\" you mutter.\n\n \"Trust me,\" Jessica states. \"You'll thank us.\"\n\n Samantha smirks. \"And so will your boobs when you're on the stairs.\"\n\n \"Sam!\" Jessica groans, swatting at her arm, but the tension in the room feels a little lighter now.\n \n\n A soft knock breaks the quiet hum of the fitting room.\n\n \"Hey,\" Riley's voice comes gently from the other side of the door. \"Are you three doing alright in there? Ready for me to come in?\"\n\n You freeze for a moment, you gaze flicking nervously between Samantha and Jessica. The air feels thicker all of a sudden, the simple act of saying \"yes\" looming over you.\n\n Jessica notices your hesitation immediately. She gets in front of you so she's in your line of sight, her voice soft but steady. \"Hey. You're okay,\" she says. \"Measurements are the easy part. She does this every single day. Nothing weird, nothing uncomfortable. And I'll be right here the whole time.\"\n\n \"Yeah, seriously,\" Samantha states. \"It's just Riley doing her thing. She'll just make sure your bra is comfortable.\"\n\n You let out a shaky breath, staring at the door like it's some kind of threshold. \"I just... don't know what to expect.\"\n\n \"That's fair,\" Jessica says gently. \"But Riley's good at this. She's done it a million times. She's not here to judge you, she just wants to make sure whatever you end up with actually fits you and feels good. That's all.\"\n\n Their words are grounding in a way you didn't realize you needed. You nod slowly, still nervous but steadier. \"Okay,\" you say finally, your voice just loud enough to carry through the door. \"Yeah. We're ready.\"\n\n The handle turns, and Riley steps inside with an easy smile, closing the door behind her. She doesn't rush, doesn't make a show of looking around. Her gaze stays on you, warm but professional.\n\n \"Perfect,\" she says. \"We'll start simple with a few quick measurements to get a sense of size. You don't have to do anything but stand still. Try to relax, okay?\"\n\n You nod, heart still pounding.\n\n \n Riley gives you a reassuring nod as she positions the tape under your bust. \"Just keep your arms relaxed. Perfect.\" Her tone is calm, the kind that makes it easier not to overthink what's happening. She pulls the tape snug—not too tight—notes the number, then moves it higher, measuring around your chest. \"Alright, one more adjustment. There we go.\"\n\n She steps back, scribbling something quickly onto her notepad before looking up with a warm, easy smile. \"You're measuring at about a 36B,\" she says. \"That's a really versatile size, which means we've got a ton of options to work with. We can go for supportive pieces that feel light and flexible, or keep it super simple.\"\n\n You let out a slow breath, feeling oddly grounded now that you actually have a number to work with. \"So... that's pretty normal, right?\"\n\n \"Very much so,\" Jessica says, grinning. \"You'd be very surprised by how common that size is. We're going to find something great.\"\n\n From the bench, Samantha nods like she already knew. \"See? I told you you'd have good proportions.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but you're grateful.\n \n \n Riley loops the measuring tape around you with practiced ease, her movements efficient but gentle. \"Stand nice and relaxed,\" she says. \"If you hold your breath, it can throw the number off a little.\" You exhale, letting your shoulders loosen as she takes the first measurement just beneath your chest, then shifts the tape up higher. \"Great, hold still. Almost done.\"\n\n \"Alright,\" she says with a small smile. She steps back and jots down a few quick notes. \"You're measuring at about a 34A. That's a great starting point. You'll have plenty of options. It's about finding what feels right.\"\n\n \"That's not too small or anything?\" you ask, nervously shifting a little on your feet.\n\n Jessica shakes her head before Riley can even answer. \"Not at all. That's like the 'welcome to options' size,\" she says brightly. \"Seriously, you're gonna have a ton of choices.\"\n\n Samantha hums. \"A-plus for the A-cup,\" she says, tapping at the bench with her fingers. \"We're officially in starter bra territory.\"\n\n You huff a quiet laugh and don't quiet meet her eye, but you don't feel as nervous now.\n \n \n Riley crouches slightly to get the tape in place, the cool fabric brushing lightly against ribs as she works. \"Alright,\" she says calmly, \"I'm going to start under the bust first.\" Her voice is steady and professional, the kind of tone that makes it easy to breathe.

      "text": "A few minutes pass in quiet after Riley steps out. Then, there's a gentle knock. \"Got a few options for you!\" Riley announces.\n\nYou crack the door open just enough to take them. She hands you a neat little stack of bras, each on a padded hanger, her smile warm but never too much.\n\n\"I got three basics and one that's a little more fun, if you're up for it.\"\n\nYou nod, murmuring a quiet thank you as she vanishes down the hall again.\n\nYou hang the bras one by one on the hook. They sway slightly, catching the light.\n\nYou run your fingers over the first one—white, smooth, and soft. Simple. It feels like the safe option. The kind you could wear without thinking or announcing anything. Just... functional.\n\nNext is a lavender one. Something about the color makes your breath hitch slightly. It's soft too, but a little more delicate, a little more expressive. It feels like something someone picked for themselves, not just to hide in.\n\nThe third is black. Sleek. Minimalist. There's something about it that feels... grounded. Like it belongs to someone who already knows what they want, who they are. You don't know if that's you yet, but it tugs at something in your chest.\n\nAnd then there's the last one—lacy black, floral stitching curling across the cups. It has a certain elegance to it that makes you hesitate. It's bold, feminine, and pretty.\n\n \n \"I'll just get one,\" you say to yourself.\n\n \n You run your fingers along one of them, the fabric light and smooth beneath your touch, and mutter mostly to yourself, \"I'll just get one.\"\n\n From the bench, Samantha shrugs like it's the most obvious thing in the world. \"Then get the one you actually like.\"\n\n You glance at her. She's not pushing. Just watching, legs crossed, expression calm.\n\n \"One that feels right,\" she adds. \"Not just what's practical. You deserve that much, [name].\"\n\n \n You run your fingers along one of them, the fabric light and smooth beneath your touch, and mutter mostly to yourself, \"I'll just get one.\"\n\n Standing beside you, Jessica tilts her head, studying you. \"Then get the one you actually like,\" she says, her tone soft but purposeful, like she's gently nudging you forward.\n\n You glance at her. She's not crowding you or hurrying you—just standing there patiently.\n\n \"One that feels like you,\" she adds. \"Not what's safe or easy, but something that makes you feel good when you wear it.\"\n\n \n You run your fingers along one of them, the fabric light and smooth beneath your touch, and mutter mostly to yourself, \"I'll just get one.\"\n\n From the bench, Samantha kicks one leg lazily over the other, her arms stretched along the backrest like she owns the place. \"Then you've gotta get the one you actually like,\" she says, her tone casual.\n\n Jessica, standing beside you, chimes in with a gentler tone. \"Samantha's right. Don't just grab something because you think you should. Pick one that feels good to you. One that feels like you.\"\n\n \"I'm always right,\" Samantha mutters. \"Anyway, don't overthink it. If you're gonna do this, at least make it something you don't hate looking at in the mirror.\"\n \n\nYour hand lingers between the lavender and the black for a moment longer before you take one down from the hook.\n\n[Choice: Get the basic white bra]\n[Choice: Get the basic black bra]\n[Choice: Get the basic lavender bra]\n[Choice: Get the lacy black bra]",

      "text": "You reach for the white bra.\n\n It's the most neutral of the bunch—plain, seamless, and soft. The kind of thing you could wear and forget it's even there. No color to read into or message to send, it's just... safe. And safe feels okay right now.\n\n You unclip it and slip it on, the band fitting snugly around your ribs. It's gentle. Light. Not restrictive, just present. You glance at your reflection in the mirror and realize your body feels a little more comfortable, like it finally has permission to settle.\n\n There's no dramatic revelation or swelling music, just a soft kind of rightness.\n\n You breathe out and roll your shoulders. This, you can handle.\n \n \n \n Your fingers hover, then curl around the sleek black one. There's something about it—minimal, structured, and just a little bold. You're not sure what exactly draws you to it, but you want it.\n\n You try it on.\n\n The fabric hugs your chest firmly, but not uncomfortably. The straps feel solid. Supportive. You look at yourself in the mirror and for a second, you seem more grounded.\n\n There's a small shift in your spine, a straighter posture, and a breath that comes easier.\n\n You didn't expect this, but here you are.\n \n \n \n You hesitate over the lavender one.\n\n It's soft. Delicate, but not girly. Calm. You hold it up and it feels like something chosen—not just worn. Almost like it's for you.\n\n You slip it on.\n\n It fits perfectly—gentle and stretchy, not too tight, not too loose. The color is subtle, but undeniably there. You look in the mirror, expecting to feel awkward. But instead, you feel something close to warmth.\n\n It's not about standing out, it's about softening into yourself.\n \n \n \n Your eyes land on the lacy one.\n\n It's delicate. Floral-patterned. Slightly sheer. Something about it feels like stepping off a ledge and trusting the ground will rise up to catch you. You're not even sure why the hell you reach for it.\n\n Maybe it's because it scares you a little. Or maybe because it doesn't.\n\n You slip it on slowly. The lace settles across your chest. You face the mirror, expecting to feel ridiculous. But you don't.\n\n You actually, somehow, feel pretty.\n\n For a moment, you stop bracing against yourself. You just exist.\n \n\n \n \n \n You pick up the white bra from the hook, holding it in both hands like you're still not totally sure it's real. It's nothing fancy—no lace, no bows, no pastel polka dots or shimmering straps. Just clean, soft cotton with a gentle curve to the cups and wide, comfortable-looking bands. It's the kind of thing that doesn't try to be anything more than what it is.\n\n Simple. Uncomplicated. Quiet.\n\n You run your thumb along the edge. There's no dramatic reveal. No butterflies. Just a subtle kind of... yes.\n\n \"I think I'll go with this one,\" you say softly, more to yourself than anyone else.\n\n Samantha, naturally, hears it anyway.\n\n \"The white one?\" she echoes, dramatically scandalized. \"Classic. Timeless. Slightly boring. I respect it.\"\n\n You roll your eyes without looking up.\n\n \"No, but seriously,\" she continues, flopping sideways on the bench like she's doing color commentary on your soul. \"You could've picked the lacy black one that Luke would like. But no. You? You go for soft white. You are terrifyingly responsible.\"\n\n \"Its comfortable,\" you mutter.\n\n \"It's aggressively neutral. I love it. You're going full blank-slate-core.\"\n\n You smile faintly and turn back to the mirror, the bra still in your hands. There's no drama to it. No rush. Just you, deciding.\n\n You slip the straps over your shoulders and carefully adjust it into place. The band fits snug but not tight. The cups settle comfortably against your chest. It doesn't dig in. It doesn't shout anything about who you are or who you're supposed to be.\n\n It just fits.\n\n You look up into the mirror.\n\n The reflection looking back is still you. A little more held together. A little more... you-shaped.\n\n Samantha's watching without a word now, her usual smirk replaced by something quieter. Pride, maybe.\n\n You nod once, almost to yourself.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"This is definitely the one.\"\n \n \n \n Your eyes move slowly over the small stack of options Riley left on the hooks. But your gaze ends up settling on a simple black bra.\n\n It's not dramatic. Not lacy or strappy or trying to be edgy. Just matte black cotton, seamless cups, and clean lines. No shine, no frills. Understated—but certain.\n\n You reach for it.\n\n \"I think...\" you say, almost to yourself. \"This one.\"\n\n You lift it carefully, letting the straps fall loose over your hands. The fabric is soft and flexible, the kind that feels like it's been washed a few times even though it's brand new. There's something grounding about it—quietly confident. It doesn't ask for permission to exist.\n\n From the bench, Samantha perks up. \"Ooh, going with the black bra. Power move.\"\n\n You glance at her in the mirror. \"You think?\"\n\n She leans forward, one leg swinging lazily. \"Oh, absolutely. Black is like, the cool older cousin of mine. Still classic, but with a tiny bit of menace. Like, 'Yeah, I'm wearing a bra, and I might also be plotting something.'\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"I'm not plotting anything.\"\n\n She shrugs. \"Not yet. But now you have the potential. That's the power of a black bra, my friend.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath, shaking your head, then turn back to the mirror. Your reflection stares back at you—shoulders slightly tense, lips pressed together. You shift your weight. The bra still rests in your hands, waiting.\n\n \"I like how it's simple,\" you say. \"Not trying to prove anything.\"\n\n Samantha smiles. \"Exactly. It just sits there and does its job. You've gotta respect that.\"\n\n You nod, then step back from the mirror and take a breath.\n\n You slowly pull the bra over your shoulders, adjusting the band behind your back. The fabric is soft where it touches your skin, snug but not squeezing. The straps settle comfortably—no pinching, no slipping. The cups mold gently over what you have there as well.\n\n You turn, checking yourself from a few angles. It doesn't flatten you. Doesn't exaggerate either. It just fits. The black fabric lies smooth across your chest, clean lines and quiet intent.\n\n You look to Samantha. She gives a little nod, more serious than her usual teasing.\n\n \"Yeah,\" she says, arms crossed. \"That's the one.\"\n\n \"I think I like it,\" you admit.\n\n \"Good,\" she replies. \"Then it's yours.\"\n \n \n \n Your eyes drift over the neat row of bras hanging on hooks. Clean white, classic black... and then—at the end—you spot it.\n\n Lavender.\n\n Your breath catches, just a little.\n\n It's not some flashy, lacy, look-at-me thing. Just a simple bra in that soft shade of purple. The fabric is smooth and matte, with a slightly heathered texture—like a comfy sleek shirt in bra form. The straps are plain, the cups seamless, no bows, no sparkle, nothing trying to be extra.\n\n Just lavender.\n\n Your fingers brush the fabric, almost without thinking. It's familiar in a strange way—not because you've worn anything like it before, but because the color feels like home. Something you used to scribble with crayons, pick out in art supplies, secretly wish your bedroom had more of.\n\n You pick it up gently, turning it over in your hands.\n\n \"I think...\" you start slowly, \"this is the one.\"\n\n Samantha glances over and immediately smirks. \"Of course,\" she says. \"Lavender. Because obviously.\"\n\n You blink. \"What?\"\n\n \"[name] Yoon, connoisseur of exactly one color since childhood. If it comes in lavender, he will choose it. You could be in a sword shop and still walk out with a lavender katana.\"\n\n You try not to grin, failing entirely. \"It's a good color.\"\n\n \"It's a commitment, is what it is,\" she teases. \"You've been in a lifelong relationship with lavender and you haven't even send it flowers.\"\n\n You turn the bra in your hands again, a quiet smile tugging at the corners of your mouth. \"I just like it. Always have. Maybe I always will.\"\n\n Her expression softens—just a little. \"I know.\"\n\n You pull the bra on, the lavender fabric cool and soft against your skin. The band fits snug around your ribs, the straps resting gently on your shoulders. The color makes your skin look softer, somehow.\n\n You adjust it slightly, step back, and take yourself in.\n \n It looks like it was always supposed to be there.\n\n Samantha whistles under her breath. \"Okay, okay. Alright. I can see the vision. That's kinda perfect, I can't lie.\"\n\n You glance at her through the mirror. \"Yeah?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" she says, crossing her arms. \"Lavender strikes again.\"\n\n You look back at the mirror, the color framing you like a quiet affirmation. The color doesn't hide you, change you, or explain you.\n\n It just fits.\n \n \n \n You spot it pretending not to be the most dramatic thing on the table.\n\n A lacy black bra.\n\n You pick it up slowly, holding it by the straps like you've just discovered something disgusting. The cups are trimmed with floral lace, semi-sheer at the top, soft fabric below. It's the kind of bra you'd expect to see in a moody perfume ad or on a mannequin with opinions about jazz.\n\n You blink. \"Is this... for real?\"\n\n From the bench, Samantha perks up like a meerkat. \"Oh. You picked that?\"\n\n You glance at her. \"I didn't say I'm picking it. I just... grabbed it.\"\n\n She leans forward, elbows on her knees, grinning like she's already writing your eulogy. \"That's not a bra, [name]. That's a statement. That's the kind of bra that has an ex's name blocked in its phone.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but your thumb keeps brushing over the lace. It's softer than you expected. Not itchy or stiff—just light, like a whisper. The black is deep and rich, the kind of color that doesn't ask for attention so much as assume it.\n\n \"You're gonna put that on and instantly start speaking in metaphors,\" Samantha continues. \"People will ask you how your day's going and you'll be like, 'The moon was cruel today.' You'd give off Aurora vibes.\"\n\n You laugh despite yourself. \"It's just a bra.\"\n\n \"No,\" she says, completely serious now. \"It's the moment. It's power. It's nighttime elegance. It's... slightly intimidating, and I love that for you.\"\n\n You shake your head, but you're already getting ready to put it on. There's a strange thrill building in your chest—not fear, exactly, but the sense that you're about to cross some invisible line and discover something on the other side.\n\n You ease the bra on carefully, adjusting the band behind your back and letting the straps slide into place. The lace lies smooth across your skin, the sheer fabric showing just enough to feel... bold. The underlayer holds just enough—gentle, not rigid.\n\n You glance up at the mirror.\n\n And freeze.\n\n The person staring back looks like they have secrets. Not the kind you hide, but the kind you choose to keep. There's something darkly elegant about the black lace, the contrast against your skin, the way it shifts how you carry yourself without even trying.\n\n Samantha lets out a low whistle. \"Welp. I'm intimidated.\"\n\n You smile, slow and a little stunned. \"It actually fits. Like, really fits.\"\n\n \"Of course it does,\" she says, leaning back, satisfied. \"That bra didn't pick you. You picked each other.\"\n\n You give her a look.\n\n She shrugs. \"Let me have my moment. This is a pivotal coming-of-age moment.\"\n\n You turn back to the mirror, hands resting lightly on your hips. The bra hugs you in a way that feels intentional—not about hiding, or passing, or even survival.\n\n It just feels like something you chose. And for now, that's more than enough.\n \n\n \n \n \n You pick up the white bra from the hook, holding it in both hands like you're still not totally sure it's real. It's nothing fancy—no lace, no bows, no pastel polka dots or shimmering straps. Just clean, soft cotton with a gentle curve to the cups and wide, comfortable-looking bands. It's the kind of thing that doesn't try to be anything more than what it is.\n\n Simple. Uncomplicated. Quiet.\n\n You run your thumb along the edge. There's no dramatic reveal. No butterflies. Just a subtle kind of... yes.\n\n \"I think...\" you start, hesitant, \"I'll just go with this one.\"\n\n Jessica, who's been standing patiently at your side, leans in to get a better look. The corners of her mouth curl into a warm smile, and you can notice something almost proud in it. \"That's a good choice,\" she says, her voice light but sincere. \"It's like, simple, but versatile. It'll go with pretty much anything. And honestly? For a first pick, it's perfect. Comfortable is always the way to go.\"\n\n You glance at her, and she looks genuinely pleased. It's as if you just passed some invisible milestone.\n\n \"I know it's not the most exciting thing here,\" you admit, lowering it slightly.\n\n Jessica shakes her head, reaching out to gently tap the strap. \"It doesn't have to be exciting. It just has to feel right for you. And this one does, doesn't it?\"\n\n You roll the fabric between your fingers and nod. \"Yeah. I think it does.\"\n\n \"Then let's see how it feels once you put it on,\" Jessica says. \"That's the real test.\"\n\n You take a breath and slip the straps over your shoulders, fumbling a little with the clasp before finally getting it in place. The material settles snugly into your skin—light, soft, and way less restrictive than you expected. It's just there in a way that feels natural.\n\n You glance at yourself in the mirror, adjusting the straps a bit, and for once you don't immediately look away. \"Yeah,\" you murmur. \"I think this is it.\"\n\n \"See?\" she says, her face brightening. \"I knew it. Looks like we've found a winner.\"\n \n \n \n Your eyes move slowly over the small stack of options Riley left on the hooks. But your gaze ends up settling on a simple black bra.\n\n It's not dramatic. Not lacy or strappy or trying to be edgy. Just matte black cotton, seamless cups, and clean lines. No shine, no frills. Understated—but certain.\n\n You reach for it and pull it off the hanger. \"I think...\" you start hesitantly, but slowly grow more certain, \"I'm gonna go with this one.\"\n\n Jessica, standing beside you, leans into get a better look. Her face lights up. \"Ooh. Good choice,\" she says, voice easy and approving. \"Black's classic, it goes with literally everything, and it's low-maintenance. Plus,\" she adds with a little grin, \"it's kind of sleek, don't you think?\"\n\n You glance at her, uncertain. \"Sleek?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" she says, shrugging lightly. \"It's simple, but in a way that feels confident. Like it's not trying too hard. And for a first one? That's perfect. You'll get a lot of use out of it.\"\n\n You look back at the bra, rolling the fabric between your fingers. \"I guess that makes sense.\"\n\n \"Try it on,\" Jessica says, gesturing toward the fitting room mirror. \"I promise it'll feel better than just holding it.\"\n\n You take a deep breath and carefully pull the straps over your shoulders. It takes a moment of fumbling with the clasp, but you manage to fasten it. The material settles against your skin, light but secure, without any digging or pinching. It feels right in a way you didn't expect.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you murmur, adjusting the straps a little. You glance at yourself in the mirror, and it really does look sleek. \"I think I like it.\"\n\n Jessica grins. \"See? I told you. That's a solid first pick. Practical and looks good on you. You'll get plenty of wear out of it.\"\n\n You let out a breath. This feels like progress.\n \n \n \n Your eyes drift over the neat row of bras hanging on hooks. Clean white, classic black... and then—at the end—you spot it.\n\n Lavender.\n\n Your breath catches, just a little.\n\n It's not some flashy, lacy, look-at-me thing. Just a simple bra in that soft shade of purple. The fabric is smooth and matte, with a slightly heathered texture—like a comfy sleek shirt in bra form. The straps are plain, the cups seamless, no bows, no sparkle, nothing trying to be extra.\n\n Just lavender.\n\n Your fingers brush the fabric, almost without thinking. It's familiar in a strange way—not because you've worn anything like it before, but because the color feels like home. Something you used to scribble with crayons, pick out in art supplies, secretly wish your bedroom had more of.\n\n You pick it up gently, turning it over in your hands.\n\n \"I think...\" you start slowly, \"this is the one.\"\n\n Jessica leans in to look at it, her brow lifting with a playful but curious smile. \"Lavender, huh?\" she says, her voice light. \"You sure like that color a lot.\"\n\n You blink at her, surprised. \"How did you know that?\"\n\n \"Because you always gravitate toward it,\" Jessica says, giving you a knowing look. \"I don't think you even notice. Anytime there's a choice, you go for the lavender one first. I just kind of picked up on it.\"\n\n You glance down at the bra in your hands, a little flustered. \"Huh. I didn't think anyone noticed.\"\n\n She shrugs lightly, still smiling. \"I notice more than you think. But hey, it works. Lavender suits you.\"\n\n You feel a strange warmth at that, one you can't quite name, and look back at the bra. \"I guess it does.\"\n\n \"Try it on,\" Jessica says, gesturing toward the fitting room mirror. \"I bet it'll feel even better once it's on.\"\n\n You nod and carefully pull the straps over your shoulders. After a bit of awkward fumbling with the clasp, it fastens, and you adjust the straps. The material settles smoothly against your skin, light, soft, and supportive. It feels... right.\n\n \"I really like this one,\" you say, surprised at how much you mean it.\n\n Jessica beams. \"See? I knew it. Looks like lavender wins again.\"\n \n \n \n You spot it pretending not to be the most dramatic thing on the table.\n\n A lacy black bra.\n\n You pick it up slowly, holding it by the straps like you've just discovered something disgusting. The cups are trimmed with floral lace, semi-sheer at the top, soft fabric below. It's the kind of bra you'd expect to see in a moody perfume ad or on a mannequin with opinions about jazz.\n\n It's not as \"safe\" as the other options, but for some reason, that makes it more appealing.\n\n \"I think...\" you start, almost hesitating. \"I like this one.\"\n\n Jessica leans over to get a better look, and a grin spreads across her face. \"Oooh,\" she teases, drawing the sound out just enough to make you roll your eyes. \"Risky. I didn't expect you to go for lace right out of the gate.\"\n\n You feel your ears warm, glancing back at the bra. \"I just like it,\" you admit, quieter than you meant to. \"It's... nice. I don't know.\"\n\n \"Hey, I'm not judging,\" Jessica says, giggling. \"I think it's a great pick. A little different, a little fancy, but still good. Definitely a statement for a first one, though.\"\n\n You shrug lightly, still looking at it in your hands. \"It just feels like something I'd want to wear.\"\n\n Jessica nods. \"Then that's exactly why you should get it. Clothes don't have to be boring or purely functional. If you like it, that's reason enough.\"\n\n You take a breath, step back toward the mirror, and start slipping it on. It takes some adjusting, but once it's in place, it fits snugly without digging in. The lace sits smoothly, not itchy like you'd feared, and it gives you a shape that somehow makes you feel... more put together.\n\n You glance at yourself in the mirror, running your hand lightly over the straps. \"I really do like it,\" you murmur, almost surprised at yourself.\n\n \"See?\" Jessica beams, leaning one shoulder against the wall with a satisfied grin. \"I knew it'd work. You're braver than you think, [name]. And honestly? That one looks great on you.\"\n\n You let yourself smile back. \"Thanks,\" you say, and you mean it.\n \n\n \n \n \n You pick up the white bra from the hook, holding it in both hands like you're still not totally sure it's real. It's nothing fancy—no lace, no bows, no pastel polka dots or shimmering straps. Just clean, soft cotton with a gentle curve to the cups and wide, comfortable-looking bands. It's the kind of thing that doesn't try to be anything more than what it is.\n\n Simple. Uncomplicated. Quiet.\n\n You run your thumb along the edge. There's no dramatic reveal. No butterflies. Just a subtle kind of... yes.\n\n \"I think...\" you start, hesitant, \"I'll just go with this one.\"\n\n Samantha tilts her head, eyes narrowing like she's analyzing something. \"Huh. The classic. Can't go wrong with white, I guess.\" Then she smirks. \"It's very... [name]. Neutral and safe, like the rest of your entire closet.\"\n\n Jessica gently elbows her as she steps in to get a closer look. \"Ignore her,\" she says with a small smile, turning her attention back to you. \"Honestly? It's a good choice. Simple, easy to wear with anything, and you won't overthink it every time you put it on.\"\n\n \"Boring,\" Samantha adds under her breath.\n\n Jessica shoots her a look. \"Comfortable,\" she corrects.\n\n You take a breath and slip the straps over your shoulders, fumbling a little with the clasp before finally getting it in place. The material settles snugly into your skin—light, soft, and way less restrictive than you expected. It's just there in a way that feels natural.\n\n \"Okay,\" you say. \"This... actually feels good.\"\n\n \"See?\" Jessica beams, her approval instant. \"I knew it. You made a smart choice.\"\n\n Samantha tilts her head, looking you up and down. \"I'll allow it,\" she says reluctantly.\n\n You roll your eyes.\n\n \"Don't second-guess it, [name].\" Jessica says. \"If it feels good, that's all that matters.\"\n\n You take another look at yourself in the mirror and nod. \"Yeah. I think it does.\"\n\n \"Then it's settled,\" Samantha says, clapping her hands together. \"Congratulations on your groundbreaking debut into the world of undergarments. Try not to cry, I know it's hard.\"\n\n Jessica sighs but laughs.\n \n \n \n Your eyes move slowly over the small stack of options Riley left on the hooks. But your gaze ends up settling on a simple black bra.\n\n It's not dramatic. Not lacy or strappy or trying to be edgy. Just matte black cotton, seamless cups, and clean lines. No shine, no frills. Understated—but certain.\n\n You reach for it and pull it off the hanger. \"I think...\" you start hesitantly, but slowly grow more certain, \"I'm gonna go with this one.\"\n\n \"Ooh,\" Samantha says from the bench. \"Someone's feeling edgy. Black? You're going to be brooding.\"\n\n Jessica shakes her head at her, smiling softly as she turns to you. \"Ignore her. Black's a great choice. It's practical, it goes with everything, and it feels a little more confident.\"\n\n You look back at the bra, rolling the fabric between your fingers. \"I guess that makes sense.\"\n\n \"Try it on,\" Jessica says, gesturing toward the fitting room mirror. \"I promise it'll feel better than just holding it.\"\n\n You take a deep breath and carefully pull the straps over your shoulders. It takes a moment of fumbling with the clasp, but you manage to fasten it. The material settles against your skin, light but secure, without any digging or pinching. It feels right in a way you didn't expect.\n\n \"Huh. I like this,\" you say, a little surprised by how much you mean it.\n\n \"Black's timeless for a reason,\" Jessica says in an approving tone.\n\n Samantha tilts her head, scrutinizing you. \"Yeah... okay. I'll give you this one,\" she says, grinning. \"Look at you. One bra in and already making fashionable choices. I'm so proud I could cry.\"\n\n Jessica laughs softly, but you can't help smiling too. This feels like progress.\n \n \n \n Your eyes drift over the neat row of bras hanging on hooks. Clean white, classic black... and then—at the end—you spot it.\n\n Lavender.\n\n Your breath catches, just a little.\n\n It's not some flashy, lacy, look-at-me thing.

Anytime there's a choice, you go for the lavender one first. I just kind of picked up on it.\"\n\n Before you can even respond, Samantha practically leaps in from the bench, pointing at you with exaggerated triumph. \"SEE? I told you everyone could tell! You love lavender!\"\n\n You groan, rolling your eyes. \"It's just a nice color.\"\n\n \"'Just a nice color,'\" Samantha mimics, shaking her head dramatically. \"Nope. It's your thing. Own it.\"\n\n Jessica grins at the exchange, nudging you gently. \"Go on. Try it on. If you like the color that much, I bet you'll like how it feels too.\"\n\n You nod and carefully pull the straps over your shoulders. After a bit of awkward fumbling with the clasp, it fastens, and you adjust the straps. The material settles smoothly against your skin, light, soft, and supportive. It feels... right.\n\n \"I really like this one,\" you say, surprised at how much you mean it.\n\n Jessica beams. \"See? I knew it. Looks like lavender wins again.\"\n\n Samantha claps her hands together in celebration. \"Lavender-lover confirmed. This is a historic day.\"\n\n Maybe they're right. Maybe lavender really is your thing.\n \n \n \n You spot it pretending not to be the most dramatic thing on the table.\n\n A lacy black bra.\n\n You pick it up slowly, holding it by the straps like you've just discovered something disgusting. The cups are trimmed with floral lace, semi-sheer at the top, soft fabric below.

I didn't expect you to go for lace right out of the gate.\"\n\n \"It's not—\" you begin, face heating up. \"I just... like how it looks, okay?\"\n\n Jessica's giggle softens into something warm. \"Look, I'm not judging. Honestly? I love it. It's a good kind of different.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" Samantha adds. \"Definitely not what I expected you to grab, but I'm here for it.\"\n\n You take a breath, step back toward the mirror, and start slipping it on. It takes some adjusting, but once it's in place, it fits snugly without digging in. The lace sits smoothly, not itchy like you'd feared, and it gives you a shape that somehow makes you feel... more put together.\n\n Samantha lets out a low whistle. \"Damn,\" she says, half-joking but also not. \"Sexy. Didn't think we were jumping straight to the 'look at me' tier, but I've gotta respect it.\"\n\n <<if [jessicaRomance] > 9>> \n Jessica covers her mouth, still giggling. But when she finally speaks, her voice is softer than it was before. \"Samantha's not wrong. It really does suit you,\" she says, her eyes flicking back to the mirror and then quickly away.\n \n \n Jessica covers her mouth, still giggling, her tone light and teasing. \"She's not wrong. Honestly, that style works way better on you than I expected,\" she says with an easy grin.\n \n\n You turn back to the mirror, adjusting the straps. \"It... feels nice. I didn't think I'd like something like this, but I do.\"\n\n Samantha grins, leaning back on the bench with a laugh. \"You're really making statements, huh?\"\n \n \n\n[Choice: Bra shopping begone!]",

      "text": "The door gives a soft click as you push it open, stepping back into the store proper. The bra feels different under your top than anything you've worn before. You tug subtly at your shirt hem out of habit, but it's more nerves than discomfort.\n\nJessica spots you first and beams, crossing her arms as she takes you in. \"Well?\" she asks. \"What's the ruling? Comfy?\"\n\nYou roll your shoulders, letting yourself feel the difference. \"Honestly?\" you say, still half-surprised by the answer. \"Yeah. Way more than I thought it'd be. It actually feels good.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I was hoping to hear,\" she says, grin softening.\n\nBefore you can respond, Riley materializes like she's been timing this perfectly. She swiftly makes her way to the register and smiles.\n\n\"Find what you liked?\" she asks, already reaching for the scanner.\n\nYou hand her the tag and the empty hanger. She scans them quickly, then pauses, tilting her head just slightly.\n\n\"You wearing it out?\" she asks.\n\nYou nod.\n\nShe nods back. She tucks the tag, the receipt, and the now-empty hanger into a little paper bag. The bag is soft pink, glossy, with a folded tissue paper top and a sticker seal with the store's logo.\n\nYou reach for your pocket, automatically, hand brushing your phone—only to be cut off by Samantha, who swoops in without ceremony.\n\n\"I've got it,\" she says, holding out her phone.\n\nYou blink. \"Wait—no, Samantha, I can—\"\n\nShe waves a hand at you without even looking. \"Don't care. Already decided. Milestone gift. First bra. It's happening.\"\n\nYou sputter. \"Sam—\"\n\nShe's already holding her phone against the card reader. The terminal beeps, confirming the payment before you can get another word out. She grins triumphantly at the sound, looking you dead in the eye. \"Done. No takebacks.\"\n\nJessica laughs softly, shaking her head. \"You really do like turning everything into an event.\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah?\" Samantha shoots back, stuffing her phone into her pocket. \"Because it is an event. That's, like, up there with getting your driver's license or learning how to cook spaghetti without setting off the smoke alarm.\"\n\nYou groan, half in embarrassment, half in amusement. \"It's really not that big of a deal.\"\n\n\"It is,\" Samantha insists. \"And you can't stop me from commemorating it. You'll thank me later.\"\n\nRiley just smiles politely, and hands you the bright pink bag. \"There you go,\" she says. \"Congrats on the new purchase. And for what it's worth, that one's a good pick. You've got an eye.\"\n\nYou mumble a quick \"Thanks,\" still not entirely sure how to deal with being complimented on your bra choices by a stranger, but Jessica gives you a quick nudge. \"See? I knew you'd make a good choice.\"\n\nYou clutch the bag a little tighter, still flushed but kind of proud in a way you don't fully want to admit. \"Yeah,\" you say quietly. \"I guess I did.\"\n\nThe three of you step out into the mall corridor together, the hum of voices and music rushing back around you. Jessica matches her pace to yours. \"So, how does it feel?\" she asks lightly. \"Wearing something that actually works for you.\"\n\n\"Weird,\" you admit, then add with a small smile, \"but good. It's... comfortable.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Jessica says simply, giving you an approving little nod.\n\nSamantha drapes an arm over your shoulders as you walk. \"Welcome to the bra club, my dude. Next stop: expanding your wardrobe. But for now? You're officially out of the 'I'm just wearing whatever' stage. I'm proud of you.\"\n\nYou roll your eyes but can't help laughing, hugging the pink bag to your chest as you leave the store with them. The whole ordeal didn't feel scary or embarrassing. It just felt like progress.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, you actually earned that little pink bag.\n\n[Choice: Bra acquired]",

Don't hate!--> \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nThe moment the three of you step out of the bra store, the mall greets you again like it never left—cool, polished tile beneath your shoes, neon signs flickering lazily overhead, and the background hum of a hundred lives in motion. Somewhere off in the distance, a child is begging for Nibblin' Nubs, and someone else's ringtone plays a muffled K-pop hook.\n\nSamantha stretches her arms overhead like she just finished a workout, rolling her shoulders dramatically. \"And that was step one in your glorious character arc,\" she declares. \"Now comes the fun part.\"\n\nYou glance over. \"That wasn't the fun part?\"\n\n\"Oh no. That was the emotionally meaningful part. Very 'soft piano plays in the background while the camera zooms in on your face.' This,\" she gestures to the buzzing mall ahead, \"is where we cue the upbeat music and the spinning clothing racks montage.\"\n\nJessica laughs lightly, covering her mouth with her hand. \"Samantha, you are so dramatic,\" she says, though she doesn't look like she minds it.\n\nSamantha spins to face her, walking backward now with the kind of reckless confidence only Samantha would have. \"It's called adding flavor, Jessica. Try it sometime.\"\n\nJessica rolls her eyes but smirks anyway. \"Uh-huh. So what's next on this epic character journey? I assume it involves more than you just dragging [name] to stores that sell T-shirts with some crazy designs on them.\"\n\n\"Funny you should mention that,\" Samantha says, grinning like she's been waiting for this. \"I vote we hit Threadz. Loud graphic tees, hoodies that look like they've been through a war, jeans that say 'I have opinions,' the works. It's a spiritual experience.\"\n\nJessica stops dead in her tracks, staring at her. \"Threadz?\" she repeats, like Samantha just said she wanted to shop for clothes in a gas station. \"Seriously? Who even still goes there in 2024?\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" Samantha puts a hand to her chest like she's been physically wounded. \"I still go there. Regularly.\"\n\n\"Exactly my point,\" Jessica fires back. \"Threadz is for people who think it's still 2009 and want to relive their MySpace glory days. NovaTrend is right there. Why would you not want to go to NovaTrend?\"\n\n\"Because,\" Samantha says, putting her hands on her hips like she's about to make a speech, \"NovaTrend is overpriced, fake aesthetic nonsense that pretends to be effortless while charging you eighty bucks for a jacket that disintegrates if you look at it wrong.\"\n\nJessica gasps like Samantha just insulted her family. \"It is not fake! It's curated. There's a difference. Plus, their fall line dropped a few months ago, and it's amazing. Cropped jackets, oversized sweaters, actual style—\"\n\n\"Style that looks like everyone else's style,\" Samantha cuts in. \"You don't shop at NovaTrend, you get assimilated by it.\"\n\nJessica narrows her eyes at her but doesn't lose her poise. \"You're impossible.\"\n\n\"And you're basic,\" Samantha counters immediately, though her grin gives away she's not actually mad.\n\nYou glance between them, half-amused, half-worried this will turn into an actual fight. \"Do... I get a say in this?\"\n\n\"No,\" Samantha and Jessica say at the same time.\n\n\"Cool. Glad I asked.\"\n\nJessica turns to you with an encouraging smile, still holding onto her composure. \"If you want something that's modern, versatile, and won't make people wonder if you live at the skatepark, we should go to NovaTrend.\"\n\n\"And if you want clothes that have personality and don't look like they were designed by an algorithm,\" Samantha chimes in, pointing toward Threadz, \"you know where we're going.\"\n\nYou exhale, staring at both stores in the distance like they're about to judge you for making the wrong choice. \"Why do I feel like this is a trap no matter what I pick?\"\n\n\"Because it is,\" Samantha says immediately.\n\nJessica smiles sweetly. \"But we'll still love you. Probably.\"\n\nYou pinch the bridge of your nose. \"Great. No pressure.\"\n\n\"All the pressure,\" Samantha says cheerfully, slapping you lightly on the back. \"Pick your destiny, dude.\"\n\nJessica clasps her hands like she's praying. \"And pick correctly.\"\n\nYou sigh, shaking your head. \"This feels less like shopping and more like hazing.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" Samantha says brightly, and you can't even be annoyed because they're both clearly having way too much fun at your expense.\n\nAnd just like that, you're standing at the fork in the road, their expectant eyes on you, like the next step in your \"character arc\" is about to be decided right here.\n\n[Choice: Head to NovaTrend]\n[Choice: Head to Threadz]",

The curated calm of NovaTrend and the sensory overload of Threadz made you feel like you were on two completely different planets, and now you're back in neutral territory.\n\nJessica takes a moment to smooth her hair. \"Okay,\" she says. \"That was... productive. But we're not done. There are still options.\"\n\nSamantha falls into step beside you, sticking her hands deep into the pockets of her baggy jeans. \"Define 'options,'\" she says, drawing out the word like she already knows she's not going to like half of them.\n\nJessica ticks them off with her fingers. \"ShatterBox, Blink + Shine, StepUp Footwear, and Cuddle Creations.\"\n\n\"Okay, so, let's translate that,\" Samantha says. \"Dark-and-edgy emo cave, a glitter bomb disguised as a store, the shoe maze, and a place where you'll drown in stuffed animals.\"\n\n\"Or, if you wanna be less dramatic, stylish alt fashion, a fun accessories spot, a versatile shoe store, and, yes, a plushie haven.\"\n\nSamantha grins. \"I can't tell the difference.\"\n\n\"Look, I'm still trying to process how I survived the last two stores,\" you say. \"Maybe let me breathe before we sign me up for more rounds.\"\n\n\"Survived?\" Jessica repeats with a smirk. \"Come on, [name]. You thrived.\"\n\n\"I tolerated,\" you say.\n\nSamantha leans a little closer, squinting at you like she's trying to read your mind. \"You're not actually dreading this, are you? Come on, you've got to admit it—you're kinda having fun.\"\n\n\"You got me there,\" you reply, chuckling.\n\n\"StepUp is a solid choice,\" Jessica comments. \"We haven't even discussed shoes. Trust me when I say the right pair can make or break an outfit. According to Sam, you've been wearing those ragged Converses since, what, middle school?\"\n\n\"They're comfortable,\" you protest.\n\n\"I'm sure they are,\" Jessica says. \"But more options never hurt.\"\n\nYou glance between the stores, the options swirling in your head. There are four stores with four completely different vibes. And you have to choose.\n\nShatterBox has dark walls, racks of fishnets, studded belts, combat boots, and merchandise from bands you don't even recognize. Mesh sleeves and eyeliner are practically required.\n\nBlink + Shine is so sparkly it's practically vibrating. Hair clips, lip gloss, and enamel pins shaped like raccoons are on display.\n\nStepUp Footwear, a staple of the Crestview Bay mall, has so many shoes it nearly makes you dizzy.\n\nCuddle Creations has so many adorable stuffed animals that the cuteness might just overwhelm you.\n\nYou take a deep breath, scanning the glowing signs ahead, and make your decision.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n[Choice: Head to ShatterBox]\n[Choice: Head to Blink + Shine]\n[Choice: Head to StepUp Footwear]\n[Choice: Head to Cuddle Creations]\n[Choice: Head to the changing rooms]",

You end up in the center of the mall, where there's a big fountain that you've passed at least six times today. It feels weirdly like coming full circle.\n\nSamantha immediately collapses onto the nearest bench like she's been mortally wounded. She flings some shopping bags onto the ground with an exaggerated sigh. \"Oh my God,\" she groans, slumping back like the bench has become her deathbed. \"This is it. My final resting place. Tell the world I died bravely in the battle of Retail Armageddon.\"\n\nJessica sits down more gracefully on the other side, smoothing her skirt with one hand while balancing some shopping bags in the other. \"You're so dramatic,\" she says lightly, though her tone carries just enough warmth to soften the jab. \"We barely walked a mile, Sam. You didn't even try anything on.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" you add, taking the spot in the middle. \"You did a whole lot of sitting and judging, which I'm not sure counts as cardio.\"\n\nSamantha tips her head toward you, squinting one eye. \"Listen, [name]. I walked emotionally. That burns more calories than you think.\"\n\nJessica rolls her eyes but grins. \"You know that's not a thing, right?\"\n\n\"It is now,\" Samantha replies, folding her arms like that ends the debate.\n\n\"You two are ridiculous,\" you say as you stretch out your legs.\n\nJessica glances at the bags in your lap. \"You actually found some good stuff today, though. I'm impressed.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" you say. \"I guess I did.\"\n\nSamantha sits up a little. \"You definitely did. Even if I can't relate to half of it. I mean, look at me.\" She gestures to herself. \"Do I scream 'soft pastels' to you?\"\n\n\"Not even a little,\" you say, smirking.\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nJessica leans in conspiratorially, pointing a manicured finger at Samantha. \"You'd look good in pastels. Admit it.\"\n\n\"Blasphemy,\" Samantha says immediately. \"I'm a dark creature of hoodies and sarcasm. You can't just... pastel-ify that.\"\n\n\"You're just scared of a little color,\" Jessica singsongs.\n\nSamantha pretends to gag. \"And glitter. Don't forget glitter.\"\n\nYou laugh. It just all feels so easy. Lighter than most of the day.\n\nSamantha suddenly lets out another loud groan. \"Okay, but for real? I'm starving. Like, I could eat the entire food court. Even the cardboard pizza and weird smoothies.\"\n\nJessica perks up at that. \"Oh, finally. I was wondering how long it would take for you to say that. I've been thinking about those pretzel bites since we walked in here.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" you say, gesturing vaguely toward the escalator, \"we could go to the food court?\"\n\nSamantha lifts her head slowly. \"Could we? Dare we? Will our weary legs carry us that far?\"\n\n\"You were literally fine two minutes ago,\" Jessica points out, standing and slinging her bags over her arm. \"Come on. It's food. That's all the motivation you need.\"\n\nYou stand too, offering Samantha your hand. \"Come on, my overworked friend. I promise there'll be carbs.\"\n\nShe takes your hand and stands up. \"Ugh. If I collapse on the way there, just roll me in the direction of carbs.\"\n\nAnd with that, the three of you march onward toward your well-earned nourishment, your bags swaying gently with each step.\n\n[Choice: Food!]",

You, Samantha, and Jessica push your way through the flow of shoppers until you spot a table near the center—close enough to the food counter but far enough away from the kids. The table wobbles a little as you touch it, and the plastic chairs are unforgivingly hard.\n\nClassic mall food court.\n\n\"Finally,\" Samantha says, throwing herself into a chair like she's just finished an Olympic event. \"If I had to endure one more boutique, I was gonna pass out.\"\n\n\"You survived, though,\" Jessica says, sitting next to her. \"And for what it's worth, you don't exactly seem like you hated it.\"\n\n\"You saw me in Blink + Shine, I looked really out of place,\" Samantha deadpans.\n\nYou plop down across from then, letting your shopping bags settle around your feet. \"To be fair, you didn't exactly try to blend in.\"\n\n\"Anyway,\" Jessica says, segueing the conversation. \"Before one of us dies from hunger, what do you want? My treat.\"\n\nYou blink. \"Wait. What?\"\n\nJessica digs into her purse and pulls out a card, sliding it across the table toward you. It's sleek, shiny, and way too fancy for this mall. A bright, silvery-blue thing with embossed letters.\n\nIt takes you a second to process. \"Is... is this a American Distress Platinum? Holy shit.\"\n\n\"Yep,\" Jessica says, but there's no real shine behind it. \"It's my dad's account, but... it's basically mine. Perks of being an only child.\"\n\nThe words feel like they should be smug, but she delivers them with the energy of someone reciting a fact. Her fingers drum against the table once before going still.\n\nYou tilt your head. \"That... sounds nice?\"\n\nJessica shrugs, her ponytail shifting with the movement. \"It's... whatever. They don't really care what I spend, as long as I don't do anything 'embarrassing.'\" She says it with a mocking little air-quote gesture, but it doesn't land like a joke.\n\nSamantha eyes her. \"So, they just give you free rein on a platinum card and call it a day? That's kind of wild, Jess.\"\n\nJessica gives a small, brittle smile. \"That's just how it is. They're busy. Always have been. You learn to, you know...\" She waves her hand vaguely, like she's brushing off smoke. \"Handle yourself.\"\n\nThere's a pause that feels heavier than it should.\n\nYou shift in your seat. \"That sounds like a lot.\"\n\nJessica meets your gaze for half a second, then looks away, like you caught her saying too much. \"It's fine. I'm used to it. Anyway, go get your food. Pick whatever you want.\"\n\nHer voice lightens, but only on the surface.\n\nYou glance down at the card in your hand, its metallic sheen reflecting the mall's bright food court lights. It suddenly feels heavier than it should.\n\nYou clear your throat. \"Alright. Guess I'll... figure out what I want.\"\n\nYou scan the nearby stalls, where a number of choices are spread out in front of you.\n\nPizza Hüt is a proud European chain that acts like putting an umlaut in the name makes their pizza cultured. The pizza's fine, but the crust is oddly sweet and the pepperoni looks like it was printed on. It's the kind of spot you eat at and then wonder if maybe you were just really hungry.\n\nLoud branding, flat burgers, and enough sauce to coat your soul. That's Burgur Kween. The combo deals are suspiciously cheap, and everything comes wrapped in foil with marketing slogans like \"SLAY THE CRAVE.\" It doesn't help the fact that their burgers look like they've been sat on, though.\n\nKansas Fried Poultry is the home of greasy chicken and coleslaw no one ever finishes. It was founded by General Thatch, whose portrait still hangs in every location—white suit, bolo tie, and a thousand-yard stare. They swear by their \"Legendary Eleven-Dust Blend™\"—you're pretty sure most of the taste comes down to the MSG though. No one knows what's in the gravy, but you eat it anyway. General Thatch would want you to be brave.\n\nTacko Bong is Tex-Mex, but barely. You order it because it smells good, then immediately question your decisions mid-bite. It's fast, cheap, and tastes decent going in. But let's be honest here—you know what happens next. There's a reason why every bathroom stall near a Tacko Bong is mysteriously out of order.\n\nKoala Express is an aggressively average Chinese fast-food chain that's somehow in every mall, airport, and food court, even though no one remembers it actually opening. The food is comforting in a suspiciously consistent way. The real mystery is the mascot: a grinning koala in a silk robe, holding chopsticks. No one knows why exactly an Australian marsupial is representing orange chicken, and the brand has never explained it. You're not here for the authenticity though—you're here because it smells good and hits the same way every time.\n\nYou weigh your options.\n\n[Choice: Pizza Hüt]\n[Choice: Burgur Kween]\n[Choice: KFP - Kansas Fried Poultry]\n[Choice: Tacko Bong]\n[Choice: Koala Express]",

The whole stall has a certain... vibe. Cold efficiency. The staff wear crisp red aprons and stare at you like they've been trained in the harshest of kitchens.\n\n The guy at the counter is tall, severe, and looks like his soul was forged in a bread oven. His name tag just reads GÜNTER.\n\n \"Willkommen to ze Hüt,\" he says, with zero inflection. \"You vill be having ze pizza, ya?\"\n\n You blink. \"Uh... yeah. Just a slice of pepperoni—\"\n\n \"Peperoniwurst.\"\n\n He types something with aggressive precision.\n\n You look at the menu. It's technically in English, but every word has been rebranded into something that nears parody. Zauce, Krustenplatte, Mozarrella der Schmeltz. There's a combo meal called \"Die Trilogie der Käse.\" It's just a three-cheese pizza.\n \n \"What drink comes with it?\" you ask.\n\n He doesn't answer. He just slides you a room-temperature orange soda with the label peeled off. You're not convinced it's carbonated. Or legal.\n\n Five minutes later, your slice arrives in a little cardboard tray printed with the phrase \"Life ist kurz. Eat die Hüt.\" There's a parsley leaf on it.\n\n You carry the tray back through the chaotic food court, the scent of your slice trailing behind you like a warning.\n\n Jessica spots you first, leaning forward in her chair as you approach. \"Finally,\" she says, glancing at the tray. \"Oh my God, you actually went to Pizza Hüt?\"\n\n \"I wanted pizza,\" you state simply, setting the little tray down on the table with a quiet thud.\n\n \"Eat die Hüt?\" Samantha reads aloud, making a face. \"That sounds like a threat, [name]. Did you just buy food or enlist in the German military?\"\n\n You plop into your chair. \"Both. Probably.\"\n\n Jessica leans over the table to get a better look. \"Is that parsley?\"\n\n \"Apparently,\" you say, gesturing vaguely to the lone, limp leaf perched on your slice like an afterthought. \"The guy at the counter, Günter, gave it to me. He didn't smile. Didn't blink either. I think he was judging me for existing.\"\n\n \"It's just Pizza Hüt, I guess,\" Jessica says, laughing.\n\n \"No,\" you state. \"This is not 'just' pizza. This is... a cultural exchange program disguised as a fast-food chain. Everything on that menu sounded like it was crafted by a mad linguist. Do you know what a three-cheese pizza is at Pizza Hüt? 'Die Trilogie der Käse.'\"\n\n Samantha snorts. \"Sounds like an avant-garde art piece.\"\n\n \"Exactly.\" You nod gravely. \"And they didn't even ask what drink I wanted. Günter just slid me an orange soda. Room temperature. Label gone. Like it was contraband.\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head, intrigued despite herself. \"Are you still gonna drink it?\"\n\n You pop open the soda and take a long sip. \"This is diplomacy, Jessica.\"\n\n Samantha leans back, smirking. \"So what's the verdict?\"\n\n You take a bite of the pizza. It's chewy, sweet-sauced, faintly peppery, and inexplicably... orderly.\n\n You swallow, then meet their eyes with the gravitas of someone who has stared into the abyss and found mozzarella. \"The Hüt delivers,\" you say simply.\n\n \"It's just mall pizza!\" Jessica says, bursting out laughing.\n\n \"Mall pizza with structure,\" you correct.\n\n Samantha gestures at the tray. \"You know what? This is your villain origin story. Next week you're showing up to school in a red apron, talking about 'ze discipline of ze crust.'\"\n\n \"Meh,\" you say, holding the slice and taking another bite. \"If that happens, it'll be worth it.\"\n\n \"Honestly? I kind of want to try it now.\" Jessica says.\n\n \"Don't,\" you respond solemnly. \"You're not ready.\"\n\n Samantha cackles. \"Oh my God, this is amazing. [name]'s been converted. Pizza Hüt is a cult, and we've lost him.\"\n\n \"If this is a cult, at least the pizza's decent,\" you state, shrugging.\n\n \n The scent of flame-grilled something smacks you the moment you pass under the neon crown-shaped sign. Burgur Kween isn't quiet. The whole place radiates confidence, hot grease, and glittery chaos. Purple lights frame the menu board. The soda machine's blasting music. And the staff? They are living in the moment.\n\n Behind the counter stands a tall server with long acrylic nails, gold hoop earrings, and a perfectly tied apron that looks more like a fashion statement than a uniform. Their name tag reads \"Miss Patty\", in Sharpie, with a tiny lipstick kiss drawn next to it.\n\n \"Well hellooo, look who just stepped into the best restaurant in town, honey,\" they say, leaning dramatically on the counter. \"What's your vibe today? Feeling crunchy? Crispy? Or just extra?\"\n\n You blink. \"Um... just a cheeseburger?\"\n\n Miss Patty places one hand on their hip and gasps. \"Just a cheeseburger? Baby, no. We don't do 'just' here. We do bold, juicy, life-changing.\"\n\n Someone in the back yells, \"Drop a royal patty and crown it, darling!\"\n\n Patty turns back to you. \"That's for you, sweetness.\"\n\n You look up at the menu, which is a fever dream of specials with names like \"The Glam Stack,\" \"Double Drama,\" and \"The Untucked Combo.\" You order a single burger and fries, and Patty nods like you've chosen your house for the season.\n\n \"Ooh, a classic. Simple. Confident. I respect it. You don't need the extra sauce—you are the flavor.\"\n\n They slide your receipt across the counter with a wink. \"Grab a straw with attitude, not one of those flimsy basic ones.\"\n\n You return to the table with a tray that looks like it just walked off a stage. Even the burger is wrapped in paper that says \"SLAY ALL DAY\" in all caps with glitter-print ink.\n\n Jessica's the first to notice when you sit back down. Her eyes eventually land on the crown. \"Oh my God,\" she says, breaking into a grin. \"They gave you a hat. Did you just get knighted or something?\"\n\n \"Uh, no,\" you reply. \"I got crowned. There's a difference. Burgur Kween doesn't serve food. They serve an experience.\"\n\n Samantha leans forward, resting her chin on her hand, grinning like she can't wait for this. \"Oh, this I've gotta hear. What happened?\"\n\n You unwrap the burger. \"I walked in, and the cashier—Miss Patty—looked at me like they could see into my soul and asked if I was feeling crunchy, crispy, or extra.\"\n\n Jessica giggles. \"So which one are you?\"\n\n \"Well, I was hoping I'd be something fun, but I ended up with a classic,\" you say.\n\n Samantha bursts out laughing. \"Shit, [name]. They saw you and decided to do a character assessment?\"\n\n \"Pretty much,\" you say, biting in the burger. It's perfect—messy, greasy, and way better than it has any right to be. \"Also, someone in the back yelled 'Drop a royal patty and crown it, darling!' while they made my order. I think that might just be the best thing I've ever heard.\"\n\n \"I love this place,\" Jessica exclaims, clapping her hands together. \"I used to come here after shopping. They hype everyone up like they're about to walk a runway instead of just... sitting in a food court.\"\n\n \"Exactly!\" you say. \"I didn't just buy a burger. I ascended.\"\n\n Samantha side-eyes the crown on your tray. \"Yeah, and then they gave you a paper hat like you're five. Truly majestic.\"\n\n \"Don't disrespect the crown,\" you reply. \"It's a symbol of power.\"\n\n \"Just eat your royal meal, Your Highness,\" Samantha states.\n\n You take another bite of the burger. Maybe, just maybe, you belong in the Kween's court.\n\n \n The smell hits you before the sign does—grease, salt, black pepper, and a kind of smoky defiance that makes it clear you didn't come here to be healthy.\n\n Kansas Fried Poultry squats in the corner of the food court like it owns the mall. The logo's just a silhouette of the state of Kansas wearing a cowboy hat, and the man behind the myth—General Thatch—is everywhere. His framed portrait hangs behind the counter, squinting like he's seen combat and invented cornbread in the same week. His statue holds a chicken drumstick like it's the Declaration of Independence. There's even a tattered American flag above the counter.\n\n The counter girl's leanin' on the register like it owes her money. Her faded name tag just says Mary-Beth and her apron's got cornbread batter scars.\n\n \"Well, hey there, sugar,\" she drawls, voice slow as sweet tea left out in August. \"You look like somebody with a deep hunger and questionable judgment. Lemme fix that fer ya.\"\n\n You open your mouth to ask a question, but she's already shaking her head.\n\n \"Nuh uh. We don't do menus. We do chicken. Hot, proud, and real enough to bring a tear to your meemaw's eye.\"\n\n She turns and bellows into the back without looking. \"Drop two thighs in the fire! And throw a mercy biscuit in there too, bless their heart!\"\n\n She slaps a bucket on the counter with a thud that feels spiritual.\n\n \"Y'all enjoy now,\" Mary-Beth says, wiping her hands on a rag that might've fought in the war. \"And if it don't light a fire in yer chest, we'll bury ya with honor.\"\n\n You carry it back to the table like it's holy.\n\n Jessica's eyes widen immediately. \"Oh my God. You didn't just get food, [name]. You got... something special.\"\n\n \"That smell is illegal,\" Samantha states, taking a deep breath. \"You walk past other people with that bucket and they're gonna start floating like cartoon creatures when they smell pie on a windowsill.\"\n\n You pull out a drumstick, the crispy skin glistening, and hold it up solemnly. \"The woman at the counter, Mary-Beth, called me 'sugar,' insulted my life choices, and then blessed me with this. I think I might be baptized now.\"\n\n \"Did you even get to order?\" Jessica asks, leaning forward on her elbows.\n\n \"No, 'cause she decided for me,\" you say, shaking your head in awe. \"I tried to ask what combos they had, and she literally waved me off and yelled at someone in the back to 'drop two thighs in the fire and throw in a mercy biscuit.' I didn't even know what a mercy biscuit was.\"\n\n Samantha squints at the bucket. \"A mercy biscuit sounds like something you eat after signing your last will and testament. Like, asking for mercy for what you're about to do to your arteries.\"\n\n You take a bite of the drumstick, and the skin cracks like a gunshot. It's spicy in a way that feels personal. \"Holy shit,\" you manage. \"This isn't chicken. This is... like... history. General Thatch didn't just fry a bird. He created a movement.\"\n\n Jessica snorts. \"Okay, relax. It's just fried poultry.\"\n\n \"You don't understand,\" you say. \"There's a tattered American flag hanging in that place. And a statue of General Thatch holding a drumstick like it's the Constitution. They don't serve chicken. They serve patriotism in a bucket.\"\n\n \"I bet patriotism tastes pretty damn good,\" Samantha says.\n\n \"It's definitely worth the calories,\" you say, taking another bite.\n\n \n The closer you get to Tacko Bong, the more it smells like a college dorm microwave and the inside of a tortilla chip bag. Not bad, necessarily—just chaotic. There's a faded mural on the wall of a cactus wearing sunglasses and a beanie, holding a burrito like it's the Holy Grail. A little sign on the register reads: \"Now Hiring. No Snitches.\"\n\n The guy behind the counter has half-lidded eyes and a name tag that says \"Chaz\", drawn in Sharpie. He's got a bandana tied around his head and a string of hot sauce pockets clipped to his belt like ammo.\n\n He stares at you for a long second after you approach. Almost as if he's buffering.\n\n \"...Yo,\" he says finally. \"You, uh... hungry?\"\n\n You nod.\n\n He nods too.\n\n \"That's sick. Me too, man.\"\n\n There's no real menu—just a few laminated photos taped crookedly to the sneeze guard. Cruncho Loco Supreme, Nacho Nacho Situation, and the Mystery Quesadilla (No Refunds).\n\n \"I can, like... throw some stuff in a tortilla?\" Chaz offers. \"We got beans. Probably.\"\n\n A second guy appears from the back. You didn't hear him come out. His name tag says \"Spoon\", and he's holding a ladle full of neon-yellow cheese like it's a sacred artifact.\n\n \"Dude, you want the drip?\" he asks. \"We got the drip.\"\n\n You pause. \"What exactly is the drip?\"\n\n He gestures at the ladle. \"This. This is the drip.\"\n\n Chaz nods solemnly behind him, \"It's, like, spiritual.\"\n\n You order something that sounds vaguely like a taco, hand over the card, and watch as they begin to construct your meal with an intense focus. There's a lot of unlabelled containers. You choose not to ask.\n\n Minutes later, you're handed a loosely wrapped bundle of tortilla, heat, and vibes. It drips. You're not sure what. But it drips.\n\n You return to the table holding your food carefully. The wrapper is already translucent from whatever's inside it—steam curling upward like it's trying to escape. It smells like melted cheese and danger.\n\n Samantha looks at it. Then at you. Then back at it. \"[name]... what the hell did you just buy? That looks like it's been legally classified as a biohazard in at least a few states.\"\n\n \"Oh my God, is that from Tacko Bong?\" Jessica asks, grinning. \"I've always wanted to try it, but like... I didn't want to die young.\"\n\n You peel back the wrapper, revealing a structurally unsound tortilla filled with... stuff. \"I don't know what this is,\" you admit. \"The guy who made it called it 'a transcendental bean event.'\"\n\n Samantha blinks. \"...He said that out loud?\"\n\n \"Yes,\" you say, nodding seriously. \"And then his coworker asked if I 'wanted the drip.' I still don't know what that means. I just said yes.\"\n\n Jessica's laughing now, covering her mouth with her hand. \"The drip. You just let them put mystery drip in your food? [name], that's how urban legends start.\"\n\n You lift the wrap slightly so they can see the neon-yellow ooze pooling at the bottom. \"This is the drip.\"\n\n Samantha leans away like it might jump at you. \"That looks like what happens when you leave nacho cheese out in the sun for a week. [name], I mean this in the kindest way possible, don't eat that. You have so much to live for.\"\n\n You take a slow bite.\n\n Both of them just stare at you, waiting for your reaction like you're a science experiment about to explode.\n\n It's hot. It's gooey. It tastes like every processed impulse you've ever had at midnight, wrapped in a tortilla and blessed by a divine entity.\n\n You swallow, staring down at it with a kind of distant respect. \"...This is incredible.\"\n\n Jessica leans in. \"You're kidding.\"\n\n \"No,\" you say, taking another bite. \"It's comfort food.\"\n\n Samantha squints at you. \"You're gonna regret that in like four hours. Maybe less.\"\n\n \"Probably,\" you agree, taking another bite anyway.\n\n Jessica laughs and grabs a napkin from the dispenser, tossing at at you. \"At least don't drip 'the drip' on yourself. That stuff doesn't look like it comes out of clothes.\"\n\n \"I doubt it would,\" you say. \"I just didn't ask too many questions. Tacko Bong isn't about answers. It's about the journey.\"\n\n \"You're braver than I am,\" Jessica says. \"Or dumber.\"\n\n \"Why not both?\" you say before taking another bite.\n\n And even as Samantha mutters something about you being a lost cause, you can't help but think: she might be right. But you also can't stop eating.\n\n \n You spot the waving golden cat before anything else—perched proudly on the counter of Koala Express, its paw moving in slow, hypnotic arcs like it knows something you don't.\n\n The menu board glows red and gold, slick with laminated sheen, listing a staggering number of combos and sides. Every single one comes with two entrées and a side. The trays are already stacked, wide enough to double as life rafts.\n\n The server behind the counter doesn't look up as she greets you. \"Hi, welcome to Koala Express. Do you want a combo or box today?\"\n\n You glance down at the steam table. There's orange chicken glistening like a sunset, beef and broccoli soaking in sauce, and fried rice piled so high it's got elevation. Everything smells like soy sauce and sugar.\n\n \"A combo?\" you offer.\n\n \"Good choice. Two entrées, one side. Orange chicken?\" She's already spooning it into your tray before you nod.\n\n You pick a second dish. It doesn't really matter what you choose, they all look like they've been prepared by someone who knows what your soul needs and doesn't believe in small portions. The food is heaped on like gravity's on break. By the time she finishes adding a scoop of chow mein, your tray weighs more than your dignity.\n\n She throws in a crushed fortune cookie and an extra packet of soy sauce for \"flavor insurance.\" Then comes the plastic lid, taped shut with serious intent. It barely fits. You nod your thanks, hand sinking under the weight as you turn to head back.\n\n You return to the table like a weary traveler dragging home his spoils, the Koala Express tray balanced in your hands like a brick of hot, edible treasure. The lid is puffed up like it's trying to escape the contents, held together by one brave piece of tape and sheer determination.\n\n You set the tray down with a thud that makes Samantha jump.\n\n \"Holy—\" Samantha leans forward, eyes wide. \"[name], did you just order for the entire football team? That tray has its own gravitational pull.\"\n\n You peel the plastic lid back, steam billowing upward like you're opening a portal to another realm. \"It's a combo meal,\" you say, as if that explains the absurd mountain of food. \"Two entrées. One side. They didn't warn me it'd come with an existential crisis.\"\n\n Jessica leans in from across the table. \"Oh my God, that looks amazing.\" She tilts her head, frowning thoughtfully. \"But also... that is so much orange chicken. Are you even allowed to take that much in one sitting? Isn't there a law or something?\"\n\n \"If there is, they don't enforce it,\" you say, blowing on the chicken carefully. \"Koala Express has no laws. Only portions.\"\n\n Samantha squints at the chow mein piled so high it could qualify as a small mountain. \"That noodle mound has altitude. I think it's staring back at me.\"\n\n \"Good,\" you say between bites. \"That means it respects you.\"\n\n Jessica giggles, poking the fortune cookie toward you. \"What does it say?\"\n\n You unwrap it, crack it, and fish the crumpled paper from the rice. \"Let me see,\" you say. \"It says 'You are full of potential. And also rice.'\"\n\n \"That's not a fortune,\" Samantha says. \"That's a cry for help.\"\n\n You shrug. \"Well, it is accurate. I am currently about 80% rice.\"\n\n Jessica shakes her head, laughing. \"At least they're honest. You basically have a week's worth of meals in there. You could survive an apocalypse with that tray.\"\n\n \"Yeah, but I wouldn't survive long,\" you say. \"I'd eat in all in one sitting and be too bloated to move.\"\n\n \"I am not carrying you out of here when you slip into a food coma,\" Samantha warns. \"Jessica can, though. She's tall. Built for it.\"\n\n Jessica tosses a crumpled napkin at her. \"That's now how it works.\"\n\n You lean back in your chair. \"If I pass out, just leave me here. This is where I live now. Among the chow mein.\"\n\n \"Well, at least you're happy about it,\" Jessica comments.\n\n And honestly? You are. For all its chaotic energy and the sheer volume of food staring you down, Koala Express delivers. It's too much at once in the best possible way.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "You slip your phone into your pocket and take a deep breath.\n\nThe house is quiet in that soft way it gets in the afternoon—sunlight filtering through the windows, the hum of the dryer spinning low in the background, and the faint scent of fabric softener floating in from down the hall. You head toward the laundry room, where you can already hear the familiar rustling of folded towels and the occasional thunk of the basket being adjusted on top of the dryer.\n\nYour mom's standing there, sleeves pushed up, folding a warm pile of towels with practiced ease. There's a little smudge of something—probably flour—on her cheek from earlier, and her hair's tied up in a messy bun, a few strands curling loose at her temples.\n\nShe looks over when she hears your footsteps. \"Hey, sweetie. Need something?\"\n\nYou hesitate in the doorway for a second, then step inside and lean against the wall, watching her work. \"Kind of. I, uh... was thinking of going shopping.\"\n\nShe raises an eyebrow, folding the towel in her hands into a perfect rectangle. \"Shopping?\" There's a flicker of surprise in her voice, though not in a bad way. More like someone just heard a cat bark.\n\n\"Yeah,\" you say, rubbing the back of your neck. \"Like, for clothes. Stuff that fits better, maybe.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" Another towel joins the stack. \"Okay. And who's dragging you out for this mission?\"\n\n<<if [jessicaRomance] > 9>> \n \"Samantha,\" you say automatically, then add, \"and... Jessica.\"\n\n Your mom pauses just enough to let you know she caught the difference in your tone. \"Jessica?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, trying to sound casual, though you can feel your face warming a little. \"Jessica Sanders. She's the cheer captain—you know, from school.\"\n\n Her eyebrows lift slightly. \"Ah. So this is a new development.\"\n\n \"Not really new,\" you say quickly, leaning against the doorframe. \"We've been talking ever since we became partners in homeroom. She's actually... really easy to hang out with? Like, she's super nice. And funny. You'd think someone that popular would be, I dunno, stuck-up or fake, but she's not. She's actually really down-to-earth. Like, she actually listens when you talk.\"\n\n Your mom glances over her shoulder, smiling faintly. \"Sounds like you think pretty highly of her.\"\n\n You rub the back of your neck, staring at the floor. \"I mean... yeah, I do. She's just cool, you know? Not just, like, 'queen of the school' cool. More like she makes you feel comfortable. It's hard to explain.\"\n\n Your mom's smile softens, though she doesn't say anything to tease you. Instead, she folds another towel, stacking it neatly on top of the others. \"Well. That sounds like a good addition to your shopping trip.\"\n\n \"Yeah.\" You shift your weight, trying to keep your voice level. \"She knows a lot about clothes too, so... she'll probably save me from whatever nightmare Samantha was gonna put me in.\"\n\n Your mom chuckles. \"Now that, I believe.\"\n\n \"Hey,\" you protest halfheartedly.\n\n \"She's the cheer captain, you said?\"\n\n \"Yeah.\" You can't help but perk up a little. \"Everyone knows her, obviously. But she's not just all image. She's been under a ton of pressure this year—like, way more than people realize—but she still makes time for people. Like, she'll stay after school just to check in on someone. I don't know how she does it.\"\n\n Your mom glances at you again, but she doesn't say what you can tell she's thinking. Instead, she reaches for her phone on the little shelf by the detergent.\n\n \"What are you doing?\"\n\n \"Sending you some money,\" she says simply.\n\n \"You don't have to—\"\n\n \"[name].\" That's her don't-even-bother tone, and you shut up. \"You're growing, you're figuring out what feels good for you, and you deserve clothes that actually fit that.\"\n\n \n You lean against the doorframe, fiddling with the hem of your shirt. \"Samantha,\" you say first, because that's the safe, obvious answer. \"And, uh... Jessica.\"\n\n Your mom freezes mid-fold. Not dramatically—just enough that you notice. \"Jessica?\"\n\n \"Yeah.\" You nod. \"Jessica Sanders. She's the cheer captain. You know, from school.\"\n\n \"I don't think I've heard that name before,\" your mom says, her brows knitting.\n\n \"That's because I've... probably never mentioned her,\" you admit, scratching the back of your neck. \"She's usually being swarmed by, like, half the school.\"\n\n Your mom's face softens, curious now instead of questioning. \"So... she's popular.\"\n\n \"Yeah, she's one of those people everyone knows,\" you say with a shrug. \"But she's easy to be around, not over-the-top or anything.\"\n\n Your mom gives you a small smile. \"Sounds like a good addition to the trip.\"\n\n \"Definitely,\" you say, leaning against the doorframe. \"Figured it'd be fun to have her along. She knows clothes way better than I do, that's for sure.\"\n\n Your mom chuckles. \"Sweetie, I love you, but that's not a high bar.\"\n\n \"Wow,\" you say, pretending to be offended.\n\n \"Well, you're going to have quite the crew,\" she says. \"Samantha and... Jessica the cheer captain. I'm trying to picture how that dynamic's going to go.\"\n\n \"Probably loud,\" you respond. \"But manageable.\"\n\n \"Mhm. Loud I can believe.\" She picks up her phone from the little shelf by the detergent.\n\n \"What are you doing?\"\n\n \"Sending you some money,\" she says, like it's the most obvious thing in the world.\n\n \"You don't have to—\"\n\n \"[name].\" Her voice has that tone that implies you shouldn't bother arguing. \"You're growing up. You deserve to have clothes that make you feel good in them.\"\n \n\nA second later, your phone buzzes in your pocket. You pull it out and check the screen: [100] transferred. She even put a note in the memo: For cool outfits and snacks. Don't blow it all on something weird.\n\n\"Thanks,\" you say, grinning despite yourself.\n\nShe shrugs, tossing another folded towel onto the stack. \"You can pay me back by not leaving your dirty clothes on the floor for me to pick up.\"\n\n\"No promises.\"\n\nShe points a finger at you in warning, but she's smiling.\n\nYou start to back out of the room, still glancing at your phone like the number might vanish. [money] USD. That's the most you've had in your account in a while. Before you're fully in the hallway again, you pause. \"Hey, Mom?\"\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"Thanks. Really.\"\n\nShe doesn't look up from the laundry this time, just nods and says, \"Have fun. Be safe. And tell Samantha I said hi.\"\n\n\"Will do.\"\n\n\"And Jessica, too. Even if she has no idea who I am.\"\n\nYou laugh under your breath, already backing toward the hallway. \"Yeah, sure.\"\n\n\"Have fun,\" she calls after as you leave, and you can still feel the little bit of warmth in her voice as you head upstairs.\n\n[Choice: Where's Sam and Jess?]",

      "text": "Samantha plunks her tray down with a loud clatter that makes the flimsy table tremble, and you swear the smell of whatever she got could clear sinuses from ten feet away. It's fried. It's bright red. It's steaming like a warning sign.\n\n\"Behold,\" she says, gesturing to the pile of food like a magician unveiling their greatest trick. \"The pinnacle of human achievement: food that's 80% grease, 20% pure malice.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"What even is that?\"\n\nShe tabs a fork into one of the spiky fried things, sauce dripping off the edge. \"I don't know, but it's spicy enough to kill me, and I respect that.\"\n\nJessica slides in next to Samantha, setting down her own tray with much more grace. Where Samantha's plate looks like it might start a bar fight, Jessica's is a neatly arranged bowl—greens, grilled chicken, and dressing on the side. Even her water bottle looks like it's judging you for your choices.\n\n\"Wow,\" you say, peering at it. \"That's... surprisingly normal.\"\n\nJessica shrugs, picking up her fork. \"It's all about balance. If I eat like this here, I can justify ice cream later.\"\n\n\"You do realize this is a mall food court, right?\" Samantha says, staring at her bowl like it just insulted her family. \"You don't come here for balance. You come here to gamble with your arteries.\"\n\n\"Some of us don't want to feel like death after lunch,\" Jessica says lightly. \"Not everything has to be a dare, Sam.\"\n\nSamantha takes a huge bite of whatever unholy fried object she's eating and talks through the chew. \"Cowardice. That's what this is.\"\n\nYou shake your head. \"She's going to combust halfway through that meal and try to blame us.\"\n\n\"Worth it,\" Samantha says without hesitation.\n\nThe three of you eat in comfortable chaos for a bit—Jessica stealing some of your food without asking (and giving you a very unapologetic smile when you notice), Samantha making exaggerated faces every time the spiece hits her tongue, and you alternating between your own food and watching them argue.\n\nThe fighting dies down eventually, replaced by that kind of comfortable quiet that only comes after a long day of doing a little too much. Samantha leans back in her chair, tossing her fork onto the tray like she's conquered the food, while Jessica picks at the last of her salad.\n\nThen, softly, Jessica says, \"I really appreciated today.\"\n\nYou glance up, a little surprised at the sudden sincerity at her tone. \"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" She nods. \"I know it wasn't about me, but... I don't know. It was nice.\"\n\nSamantha raises an eyebrow. \"What? You're not even the one we dragged around shopping. Shouldn't [name] be the one giving emotional speeches?\"\n\nJessica smirks at that but doesn't fire back right away. She takes a breath, tucking a strand of blonde hair behind her ear. \"I guess I just... got to be myself today. Like, really myself. I wasn't worried if people were staring or if I said the 'right' thing. i just... hung out. Looked at ugly clothes. Laughed too much.\"\n\nYou exchange a glance with Samantha, and she's watching Jessica with a rare kind of seriousness.\n\nJessica shrugs like she hasn't just said something heavy. \"I don't get to do that a lot, you know? Everyone always expects me to be so much. Friendly. Popular. Whatever. Today was just fun.\"\n\nYou and Samantha stay quiet for a beat, the clatter of the food court filling the space instead. Jessica doesn't usually open up like this. She's the one who keeps it together, who knows how to say the right thing at the right time, who makes everything look effortless. But now, at this moment, she's just... Jessica.\n\nSamantha leans forward, resting her chin in her hand. \"Well,\" she says, surprisingly gentle, \"you don't have to do all that here. Not with us.\"\n\n\"I just appreciate it,\" Jessica says, her blue eyes bright but calm. \"For letting me just be me today.\"\n\nYou shift in your seat as the words hang there.\n\n[Choice: It's alright.

A throwaway. Something people say when they're being reassuring.\n \n It doesn't.\n\n Jessica freezes mid-sip of her water bottle. \"Wait,\" she says, tilting her head with an incredulous little half-smile. \"You... love me for me?\"\n\n You lift your hands in mock defense. \"Not like that. I mean, like—'love' as in, you know, love. Not, like, love-love. Just—ugh, you know what I mean.\"\n\n Jessica sets her cup down, but her eyes don't leave yours. There's a small laugh in her throat, but it's softer than usual. \"Do I?\" she teases.\n\n You rub the back of your neck, heat creeping up your face. \"I mean it in the way you say you love pizza or... sleep. Like, casual love. Friendly love. Don't get weird about it.\"\n\n She raises one perfect eyebrow. \"Mhm. Sure. Casual love. Totally normal.\" \n\n \"Exactly,\" you say quickly. \"See? You get it.\"\n\n She tilts her head and leans forward onto the table, resting her chin on her hand. \"But still. You don't usually just say that kind of thing, you know? Like... 'love you for you.' It's kind of...\" She trails off, lips tugging into a faint smile. \"It's kind of nice to hear.\"\n\n You blink, unsure how to respond for a second. \"Well, good,\" you say finally, deciding to lean into it. \"Because I meant it. You don't need to perform or whatever. Not for me. You're just... Jessica. And that's more than enough.\"\n\n Her smile deepens. \"You're kind of full of surprises, you know that?\"\n\n You smirk, acting nonchalant though your heart's hammering. \"I try.\"\n\n From across the table, Samantha's eyes dart between the two of you, wide and unblinking, like she's watching a live soap opera unfold. After a few seconds, she finally breaks the silence. \"What the hell just happened?\"\n\n You glance at her innocently. \"We were talking.\"\n\n Jessica laughs, a little too pleased with herself. \"Don't worry about it, Sam. We're just bonding.\"\n\n \"Bonding,\" Samantha repeats flatly, rolling her eyes. \"That's one word for it.\"\n\n As your eyes meet Jessica's, you can tell you're both thinking the same thing. The conversation wasn't as casual as you both pretended it was.\n \n \n \n \n \"It's alright,\" you say, aiming for casual reassurance as you lean back in your chair. \"I love you for you.\"\n\n Jessica blinks. Her expression flickers—surprised, maybe a little caught off guard—before she lets out a small laugh that doesn't quite reach her eyes. \"Wow,\" she says. \"That's a lot.\"\n\n You rub the back of your neck, suddenly hyperaware of how warm your face feels. \"I didn't mean it, like—love love,\" you clarify quickly, flailing your hand a bit like that'll erase the weight of your words. \"I meant, you know... just as a friend.\"\n\n She studies you for a moment—longer than feels comfortable—then gives a little nod, her smile polite but careful. \"Yeah. I get it,\" she says softly, then adds, almost like she wants to make sure you really hear her: \"And you're a really good friend, [name]. I don't want you to forget that.\"\n\n Something in the way she emphasizes \"friend\" lands like a soft thud in your chest.\n\n You laugh, but it comes out thinner than you intended. \"Yeah. Right. Friends. That's... exactly what I meant.\"\n\n \"Good. Because I appreciate it a lot. You're sweet, it's just that I...\" she pauses, searching for words that don't quite show up, then settles on, \"You know. I've got a lot on my plate. But it means a lot you said that.\"\n\n You nod quickly, not sure what else to do. \"Yeah. No worries. I didn't mean anything by it.\"\n\n There's a stretch of silence before Samantha leans across the table, whispering with zero tact, \"That was brutal, man.\"\n \n\n \n \n You don't even have to think about it.\n \n \"You don't need to thank us,\" you say, leaning forward slightly. \"We like you for you. That's... kind of the point, isn't it?\"\n\n Jessica blinks, caught off guard, but a soft smile forms on her face. \"That's really nice to hear,\" she says, her voice quiet but steady. \"I don't know if I'll ever really be able to believe that, but that still means a lot.\"\n\n Samantha, who's been uncharacteristically quiet for the last thirty seconds, immediately cuts in, though her tone lacks its usual bite. \"Okay, fine,\" she says. \"I'll admit it. I liked hanging out with you today too, Jess.\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow in amusement. \"Oh? That almost sounded like a compliment.\"\n\n \"Don't get used to it,\" Samantha fires back instantly. \"But seriously. I kind of... thought wrong about you. Like, I figured you'd be a little shallow. Not in a mean way! I just mean—popular girl, perfectly styled hair, never a single thing out of place? You gave off 'too good for mall chaos' vibes.\"\n\n \"And yet here I am,\" Jessica says with a smirk. \"Eating in a mall food court with you two and somehow surviving.\"\n\n Samantha shrugs. \"Yeah, well, turns out you can hang. Plus, you roasted me back a couple times today. I respect that. Most people just get steamrolled.\"\n\n You nod in agreement. \"She really did. You got Samantha to shut up for a whole five seconds once. That's an achievement.\"\n\n \"Bold words from the kid who nearly cried after scraping his ankle when we were kids,\" Samantha shoots back, smirking.\n\n \"Oh, come on. That was ages ago,\" you protest. \"And I did not nearly cry.\"\n\n Jessica laughs again, and for a moment it feels like you're all just kids with no stakes. When life was just simple.\n\n \n \n You grin, trying to lighten the mood. \"Well, you were still kind of perfect today.\"\n\n Jessica's expression changes almost instantly. Her smile falters, the warmth in her eyes cooling to something distant.\n\n \"Oh,\" she says after a moment, quiet and clipped. \"Right. Perfect.\"\n\n The words lands like a brick.\n\n You want to take it back immediately, to explain that you didn't mean it like that, but she's already shifted her focus back to her bowl. Even though there's nothing left, she scrapes at the sides halfheartedly, her shoulders hunching just slightly.\n\n The worst part is she doesn't correct you. Doesn't joke it off. She just goes quiet, retreating into herself like the moment's been ruined.\n\n Samantha raises an eyebrow at you, silently asking what the hell you just did.\n\n The rest of the mall stretches on, heavier than before, the easy flow of conversation gone.\n \n\n[Choice: All done!]",

      "text": "Samantha wipes her hands on a napkin and leans back with a satisfied sigh. \"Alright,\" she declares. \"The next mission: ice cream.\"\n\nYou blink at her. \"Ice cream? We literally just ate. Like, just now.\"\n\nShe stares at you like you've just spoken heresy. \"And? Dessert is a separate stomach event. It's science, [name]. Look it up.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Science?\"\n\n\"Yes. Science. You think humanity just invented dessert for fun? No. We evolved to need it.\" She's already gathering her trash like the conversation is over. \"We need balance. Salt, grease, then sugar. That's how you achieve true harmony.\"\n\nYou glance at Jessica for backup, but she only laughs, dabbing her fingers with a napkin. \"Honestly? She's not wrong,\" Jessica says with a little shrug. \"I could go for some ice cream. Sounds nice.\"\n\n\"See? Jess gets it.\" Samantha grins. \"And you, my dear [name], are outnumbered.\"\n\nYou sigh. \"Fine. But if I pass out from sugar overload, that's on you two.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Samantha says brightly, tossing her trash into a nearby bin. \"I'll buy you a little cone. One scoop. Perfect.\"\n\nYou laugh as you stand, grabbing all the bags. \"You're unbelievable.\"\n\n\"And yet, you follow me anyway,\" she says. \"It's called charisma.\"\n\nThe three of you weave through the thinning food court crowd and make your way to the ice cream parlor. Samantha walks a few steps ahead, humming some unrecognizable tune under her breath, while Jessica falls into step beside you. The smell of waffle cones and vanilla hits first—sweet and warm, with that distinct promise of a sugar rush.\n\nSamantha practically presses her face to the glass display. \"Oh my God,\" she says with reverence. \"Look at them. Look at all those flavors. They're beautiful.\"\n\n\"You're acting like it's art,\" you say.\n\n\"It is art,\" she shoots back, not even glancing at you. \"Edible art. Art you can smother in sprinkles.\"\n\nJessica lingers near the menu on the wall. \"Okay, but do we go classic? Or do we commit to one of these crazy flavors?\"\n\n\"Do I dare mix the cookie dough with the cotton candy again?\" Samantha mutters to herself.\n\n\"Didn't that give you a stomachache last time?\" you ask.\n\n\"Yes,\" she says gravely. \"And I learned nothing.\"\n\nYou step forward as the server behind the counter glances up with a smile, ready to take your order.\n\n \n You glance over the rows of colorful options, each more swirled and sprinkled and unique than the last... and go for vanilla.\n\n Classic. Safe. Uncontroversial.\n\n The moment the scoop hits the cone, Samantha lets out a slow, theatrical exhale.\n\n \"Vanilla?\" she says, eyebrows climbing. \"Really, [name]? In a place that sells 'Cereal Killer Crunch' and 'Unicorn Tears Surprise,' you picked vanilla?\"\n\n You shrug. \"It's good.\"\n\n \"Yeah, so is water,\" she mutters. \"And that has no personality.\"\n\n \"I think vanilla and water are underrated,\" Jessica says. \"IT's kind of comforting. Like... dependable.\"\n\n \"Do not justify this flavor cowardice, Jess,\" Samantha says.\n\n \"I'm just saying that sometimes simple is nice,\" Jessica continues, ignoring her.\n\n \"Simple is what you settle for when you give up on life,\" Samantha replies.\n\n \"Well, this simple vanilla is going to taste amazing, so I win,\" you say.\n\n \"Sure, champ,\" Samantha mutters. \"Live your boring life.\"\n\n \n You don't hesitate. One scoop of rich chocolate, no frills. Reliable and an easy win.\n\n Samantha raises an eyebrow. \"Chocolate, huh?\" she says, giving a small nod. @.samantha;\"Can't go wrong with chocolate.\"@@\n\n \"Did you just... approve of my choice?\" you ask.\n\n \"No, of course not,\" she responds, clearly holding back a smirk. \"Just very... childish.\"\n\n You look at her flatly. \"It's chocolate. Everyone likes it.\"\n\n \"I'm with [name],\" Jessica says. \"Chocolate's always a good choice. It's like... timeless.\"\n\n \"And that's the problem,\" she says. \"It's too safe. It's 'timeless' because there's nothing to it.\"\n\n \"I'm the one with the ice cream, you're the one with opinions,\" you respond.\n\n \"Hey, I never said it was a bad pick,\" Samantha says.\n\n \n You lean forward and point decisively. \"Cookies and cream, please.\"\n\n The worker nods and scoops you a generous swirl, speckled with crumbled cookie bits. Just the right amount of crunch and cream.\n\n Samantha watches it and hums approvingly. \"Ah, yes. The indecisive person's favorite. 'I want cookies, but also... milk? but cold. But frozen. But not too adult.'\"\n\n Jessica laughs softly. \"Honestly, I like cookies and cream. You can't go wrong with cookies in ice cream. It's like getting a bonus snack.\"\n\n \"Thank you,\" you say. \"Finally, some respect.\"\n\n \"It's just too good,\" Samantha says, like she's making some great point. \"Everyone likes it. That's what makes me suspicious.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Are you seriously gatekeeping ice cream right now?\"\n\n \"Yes,\" she says solemnly. \"I'm morally obligated.\"\n\n \n You point to the strawberry. It's pale pink with little bits of fruit tucked inside.\n\n Sure enough, Samantha glances over and raises both brows. \"Strawberry?\"\n\n \"What?\" you say, taking a bite. \"It's good.\"\n\n \"Oh, I'm not judging,\" she says, sliding her hands into her pockets. \"It's just kinda sweet. Unexpected.\"\n\n \"Am I not sweet?\" you ask.\n\n She laughs under her breath. \"Let's not get into that.\"\n\n \"I think [name]'s sweet,\" Jessica chimes in.\n\n \"Then you don't know him well enough,\" Samantha murmurs.\n \n\nSamantha stares down the row of ice cream tubs with her arms crossed. Her weight is shifted to one hip and her lips are pursed.\n\n\"No,\" she mutters at mint chip. \"Too toothpaste. No,\" again at rainbow sherbet. \"Not eating something that looks like it was sneezed out by a unicorn.\"\n\n\"Want some privacy?\" you ask, deadpan.\n\nShe shoots you a glare, then points at a tub toward the end. \"That one, please. Triple Fudge Frenzy. It speaks to me.\"\n\nThe worker gives her a nod and starts scooping.\n\nJessica steps up next, casual as anything. \"Neapolitan,\" she says.\n\nSamantha turns on her like she just confessed to a crime. \"Neapolitan? Really? What are you, an ice cream sampler plate in human form? That's three flavors.\"\n\nJessica arches an eyebrow. \"And Triple Fudge Frenzy isn't also three flavors? Lemme think. Fudge, fudge, and... oh, more fudge?\"\n\nSamantha opens her mouth like she has a retort, then shuts it down with a glare. \"...I don't like your tone.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought.\"\n\nThe three of you move toward the checkout counter. When you make your way there, Samantha turns and stares wordlessly at the pile of shopping bags looped around your arm and cradled against your hip. Her gaze travels from the patterned handles to the glossy branded logos. Her eyes narrows. Her expression goes blank.\n\nYou don't even need to say it.\n\n\"I—\" you start.\n\nShe cuts you off with a heavy sigh, like she's just aged five years. \"[name]. My sweet, dumb shopping casualty. Do you have any money left?\"\n\n\"I have emotional gratitude,\" you say, shrugging sheepishly.\n\n\"That won't pay for dairy, buddy.\"\n\nJessica leans over to peek at your haul. \"Honestly? I'm impressed. You did quite a bit of damage in this mall.\"\n\n\"Yeah...\" you say, voice trailing off.\n\nStill grumbling, Samantha pulls her phone out and taps it against the reader before you can argue. A chime sounds, confirming the payment.\n\n\"Thanks,\" you murmur, already guilty.\n\nShe hands you your cone like she's bestowing you with a cursed heirloom. \"You owe me.\"\n\n\"Fair,\" you reply, nodding solemnly.\n\n\"No, like—you seriously owe me,\" she continues, pointing a dramatic finger at your face. \"Next time we pass a store that sells squishmallows, you're buying me the dumbest, biggest, ugliest one they have. I want it to ruin my bed aesthetic.\"\n\n\"You know what?\" you say, laughing. \"Deal.\"\n\nWith cones in hand, the three of you shuffle toward a nearby bench that's somehow both sticky and cold at the same time. You manage to arrange your bags into a neat little fortress on the floor before sitting. Jessica perches next to you, daintily eating her ice cream, while Samantha's already halfway through her triple-fudge monstrosity.\n\n\"So,\" Samantha says, licking a glob of chocolate off her thumb. \"Now that [name]'s officially bankrupted himself and expanded his wardrobe... what do we even talk about?\"\n\n[Choice: If you could swap bodies with anyone for a day, who would it be?]\n[Choice: If you could disappear for a week and go anywhere, where would you go?]",

Like... our Luke? All-brawn-no-brain Luke?\"\n\n \"Exactly,\" Samantha states. \"Surely there's gotta be something in that brain of his, and I want to know what it is. Like, does he think in full sentences? Or is it just vibes and offensive linemen? He's basically a human Labrador with a football scholarship. Can you blame me for being curious?\"\n\n You snort. \"You could just ask him what's going on in his head, you know.\"\n\n \"Dude, I have asked,\" she says flatly. \"His answer was, and I quote, 'Mostly just chicken nuggets and game strategy.'\"\n\n Jessica giggles behind her cone, shaking her head. \"Honestly? That tracks.\"\n\n Samantha leans back dramatically, holding her triple fudge cone like it's a microphone. \"But imagine living in Luke's body for a day. No stress. No overthinking. You get to run fast, eat whatever you want, and everyone cheers when you throw a ball. It sounds like a vacation.\"\n\n \"Until you have to play in an actual game,\" you point out.\n\n \"Yeah, but in his body, I'd actually be good at it,\" she counters. \"Do you know what I'd do with that kind of power? I'd get so smug. And tall. Oh my God, I'd be tall for a day.\"\n\n \"That's your big dream?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n \"Look, don't knock it 'til you've spent your whole life looking up at people in crowded hallways,\" she says.\n\n You laugh, shaking your head, then turn to Jessica. \"What about you?\"\n\n Jessica pauses.\n \n .\n\n \"Jordan,\" she says finally.\n\n You and Samantha share a glance. \"Jordan?\" you ask.\n\n \"As in, Jordan Jordan?\" Samantha adds. \"Icy Quarterback Jordan? The Jordan that doesn't talk to anyone?\"\n\n Jessica nods, unbothered by her tone. \"That's the one.\"\n\n \"Why him?\" you ask.\n\n Jessica shrugs, but there's a hint of thoughtfulness in the motion. \"He's... different. Closed off, yeah, but there's more there. You can just tell. He doesn't open up to anyone. Even when he's surrounded by people, it feels like he's somewhere else.\"\n\n \"So you want to swap bodies with him just to... solve the mystery?\" Samantha asks.\n\n \"Kind of.\" Jessica smiles faintly. \"I've been trying to figure him out for months, and I haven't been able to. He's like this puzzle nobody else realizes is there. If I could just be him for a day, maybe I'd get it. Maybe I'd finally understand what's going on in his head.\"\n\n \"Or maybe it's just chicken nuggets and game strategy in there too,\" Samantha says with a smirk.\n\n \"I doubt it,\" Jessica says. \"But at least I'd know.\"\n\n \"That's actually kind of interesting,\" you admit. \"You can't ever actually know what someone else is thinking.\"\n\n \"Man, you guys are making me sound shallow,\" Samantha says. \"You're out here talking about deep emotional connections and I'm over here like, 'Give me Luke's tall body and let me dunk on people.'\"\n\n \"Wrong sport,\" you state. \"Also, you wouldn't be able to.\"\n\n She glares at you. \"I'd figure it out.\"\n\n \n You lean back against the bench, letting the ice cream melt lazily on your tongue, and glance between Samantha and Jessica.\n\n \"If you could disappear for a week and go anywhere, where would you go?\" you ask, glancing between them. \"No explanations, no responsibilities, no one asking where you were.\"\n\n Samantha leans back immediately, squinting at you over her cone. \"Disappear? Like... no contact, no talking to anyone? For a whole week?\"\n\n \"That's the idea,\" you state.\n\n She shakes her head. \"Hard pass. I'd last, like, a day. Maybe two if I had internet. I like people too much to be alone that long. If I disappear for a week, I want to disappear into a festival. Or a party. Or—oh!—a convention with free snacks. Not some wilderness trip.\"\n\n You can't help but laugh. \"You'd disappear into... crowds?\"\n\n \"Exactly,\" she says. \"It was the fun kind of disappearing, [name]. Not the existential one.\"\n\n \"That's not really disappearing,\" Jessica says.\n\n \"Sure it is,\" Samantha counters. \"If I blend in with a thousand other people, poof—I'm gone. Unfindable. Like Where's Waldo, but sarcastic.\"\n\n You snort, shaking your head. \"That's one way to look at it.\"\n\n Jessica, meanwhile, is quiet. When she finally speaks, her voice is softer. \"I'd do it. Disappear for a week, I mean.\"\n \n You tilt your head. \"Yeah?\"\n\n She nods. \"I think about it sometimes, actually. I'd rent some little cabin in the mountains or by a lake. Just somewhere green, where I can wake up and only hear wind and water. I'd turn my phone off. No texts, no notifications, no people. Just... me. Books, music, maybe a sketchpad. No expectations. No schedule. No... image to keep up.\"\n\n Her words hang there for a moment, heavy in their honesty.\n\n \"So why don't you?\" you ask, curious.\n\n She gives a small, almost sad laugh. \"Because I can't, [name]. You know how it is. People would notice. My parents, school, the squad, everyone. And when I came back, I'd have to explain it, or deal with whatever they decided to assume. It wouldn't really be disappearing. It'd just be creating a new problem I'd have to fix later. So I don't.\"\n\n \"You actually planned that all out, huh?\" Samantha says, a frown on her face.\n\n Jessica shrugs. \"I've thought about it a lot.\"\n\n \"Sounds like you really need that week,\" you state.\n\n \"Maybe I do,\" she admits.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Like, actual night. When the hell did that happen?\"\n\nYou glance at the sky. \"Uh... somewhere between the third and fourth store we visited?\"\n\nShe pulls out her phone, checks the time, and groans. \"Oh my God, [name].

I swear I walked the equivalent of a half-marathon today. And now I have to—\" Samantha freezes mid-rant, realization dawning, and looks at Jessica. \"Wait. Crap. I have to walk home in the dark.\"\n\nJessica blinks at her like she's grown a second head. Then she dangles the car keys in front of Samantha's face, the metal glinting under the light. \"Forgot already?\"\n\nThere's a beat of silence. Then Samantha gasps, grabbing Jessica by the shoulders with dramatic energy. \"Oh my God. Hallelujah. I am saved.\" She bows her head, muttering, \"Thank you, mysterious forces of the universe, for blessing me with a ride and sparing me from dying of exhaustion on the side of the road.\"\n\nJessica laughs, shaking her off. \"You're welcome, but don't make it weird.\"\n\n\"It's too late for that,\" you say, adjusting the loop of shopping bags digging into your wrist.\n\nSamantha glares half-heartedly at you, then trudges alongside as the three of you cross the lot. Jessica's car waits in the back row, tucked beneath one of the lampposts.\n\n\"Okay,\" Jessica says, popping the trunk open with a quick click. \"Bag Tetris time. Don't crumple anything.\"\n\nYou load your spoils into the trunk, the bags rustling as they settle into a lumpy pile. Jessica carefully rearranges them after you toss your bags in so nothing will slide during the drive.\n\n\"Of course you're reorganizing,\" Samantha mutters.\n\nJessica shuts the trunk with a firm thud. \"[name] will thank me when all his stuff isn't crushed.\"\n\nYou climb into the backseat while Samantha claims shotgun. Jessica slides into the driver's seat and starts the engine. \"Seatbelts,\" she says automatically, glancing at both of you before backing out of the space.\n\n\"Wow,\" Samantha mutters, clicking hers into place. \"Mom mode activated.\"\n\nJessica rolls her eyes, but there's a tiny smirk on her lips as she steers the car toward the exit.

What am I, a coward?\" she says, pushing past you into the entryway. \"I am committed to the cause and to cardio. Also, I don't have a car.\"\n\nYou laugh, shutting the door. She glances around like she's inspecting the place for changes, then squints at you.\n\n\"Wait,\" she says, suspicious. \"We're walking to the mall too, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, of course. That's how we always go.\"\n\nShe groans so dramatically you're surprised she doesn't fall over. \"Bro. I just walked here. That's already twenty minutes. I was not emotionally prepared for part two of this pilgrimage.\"\n\n\"You'll live,\" you say.\n\nShe takes a long swig from her water bottle, then caps it with a snap. \"Fine. But if I die halfway, you have to drag me the rest of the way and tell my cat I loved her.\"\n\n\"You're very dramatic for someone who claims to be strong.\"\n\n\"Pain builds character,\" she says breezily. \"Now, come on. Let's go buy you an identity.\"\n\nYou're about to reply when the low purr of an engine makes you glance outside.\n\nA sleek, pearly-white car pulls up to the curb in front of your house, the kind that looks like it gets hand-waxed every Sunday.\n\nSamantha follows your gaze, frowning. \"Uh... who the hell is that?\"\n\nThe car door opens, and out steps Jessica.\n\nShe's dressed effortlessly nice—pink jacket layered over a white top, hair perfectly straightened and tied back with a bow. You blink, because for a split second it's like she doesn't belong on your front step—Jessica Sanders, the queen bee of Pacific Crest High, standing in front of your door like this is completely normal.\n\nShe spots you through the window and waves with a bright smile, like she hasn't just caused your brain to hit a full stop.\n\nIt's only then that you realize the front door is still closed. You fumble for the handle, pushing it open just as Samantha pokes her head through the gap.\n\n\"Dude, what's taking so—\"\n\nHer words die on her lips when she sees who's standing there.\n\nShe freezes. Blinks. Then says, very flatly, \"Why the hell is Jessica at your house?\"\n\nJessica blinks too, but she recovers quickly, offering Samantha a friendly wave. \"Hi,\" she says, like this is all completely normal.\n\nSamantha, meanwhile, swivels toward you with a slow, deliberate look. \"[name],\" she says, voice low and suspicious. \"Why. Is. Jessica. Here?\"\n\nYou try your hardest not to laugh at how intense she suddenly looks. \"Surprise?\"\n\n\"Surprise?!\" Samantha's voice jumps a whole octave. \"No. No, you don't just do this. What is this? What is happening? Did I hit my head on the way over here? Am I concussed?\"\n\nJessica laughs, stepping forward like she's defusing a bomb. \"[name] invited me,\" she says lightly. \"I thought it'd be fun to help out. Hope that's okay.\"\n\nSamantha turns back to her, incredulous. \"You what?\" Then back at you: \"You invited her? And you didn't tell me?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" you say, giving her a sheepish shrug. \"I thought it might... you know. Be good to have someone else's input.\"\n\n\"Input,\" she repeats, narrowing her eyes. \"Oh, sure. Nothing like ambushing me with the most popular girl at school to make this trip super chill.\"\n\nJessica just laughs again, seemingly unfazed. \"Well, hopefully, I can make it worth your while.\"\n\nSamantha stares at her for a beat, then mutters, \"This is so weird,\" under her breath.\n\n\"Come on,\" you say. \"The mall's not going to shop itself.\"\n\nJessica gives you another bright smile, stepping back toward her car. Samantha lingers for a moment, then finally sighs and trudges after you. \"Unbelievable,\" she mutters. \"You're lucky I like you.\"\n\nYou can't help but grin. Whatever today turns into, it's definitely going to be interesting.\n\n[Choice: Onward!]",

The car is even more impressive up close than it looked from the doorway—sleek and pearly-white, with tinted windows that catch the afternoon sun. The chrome trim gleams, and the paint is so clean it reflects the trees lining your street.\n\nSamantha stops dead in her tracks. \"Uh. Excuse me,\" she says, pointing like the car personally offended her. \"What the actual hell is this?\"\n\nJessica pauses, glancing back. \"My car?\"\n\n\"No,\" Samantha says, stepping closer, squinting at the vehicle as if she expects to find secret compartments. \"No. This is not a car. This is... some kind of spaceship. You're telling me you drive this every day like it's no big deal?\"\n\nJessica laughs lightly, unlocking the car with a soft beep. \"It's just a newer model. My parents wanted me to have something safe. And yeah, it's nice. I know I'm lucky.\" She doesn't sound braggy when she says it, just like she's just acknowledging how it is.\n\nSamantha stares at her for another moment, then huffs. \"Cool. Meanwhile, I don't even have a car. I'm still living the two-leg express life.\"\n\n\"I mean, I used to be there too,\" Jessica replies easily, opening the driver's side door. \"Until last year, I was catching rides with the upperclassmen. It's definitely a privilege, and I don't take it for granted. But hey, at least walking keeps you in shape, right?\"\n\nSamantha narrows her eyes and, for once, she can't quite come up with a comeback. \"Whatever,\" she mutters before yanking open the back door.\n\nYou climb into the passenger seat, sinking into smooth leather that feels way too nice for a high schooler's car. The cabin smells faintly of leather and vanilla, and sunlight streams in through the sunroof. Jessica slides into the driver's seat and presses the start button. The dashboard lights up, and a large touchscreen on the center wakes up, immediately syncing to her phone.\n\nSamantha leans forward between the two front seats, scanning everything like she's in a museum. \"Holy shit,\" she says. \"This thing has Bluetooth? Like, real, working Bluetooth? And a giant screen? This is ridiculous.\"\n\nJessica glances at her in the rearview mirror with an easy smile. \"Yeah, it makes it real easy to call and play music. Honestly, I don't know what to do without it now.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" Samantha scoffs. \"I'm over here riding in my mom's car that screeches in pain if you push it past fifty. You're out here with a rolling computer. I don't even know how to process this.\"\n\nJessica chuckles, adjusting the mirrors. \"Trust me, I get that this looks like a lot. It's my first real car—before this I was just borrowing this old one to practice on. They wanted me in something safer, and... well, I'm really lucky my parents could do that for me.\"\n\nSamantha studies her for a second, then flops back into her seat. \"Alright. At least you're self-aware. That's points in your favor.\"\n\nJessica smiles, starting up the car. \"I'll take the points.\"\n\nYou buckle your seatbelt, trying not to grin at the exchange. Samantha crosses her arms and mutters, \"I walked here, and now I'm getting chauffeured in the presidential motorcade of Pacific Crest.\"\n\n\"Presidential motorcade?\" Jessica repeats, giggling. \"That's a new one.\"\n\nSamantha shrugs. \"I call it like I see it.\"\n\nJessica just shakes her head, still smiling as she eases the car onto the road. \"Well, I'll try to live up to the title.\"\n\nYou settle back into your seat as the car glides smoothly down the street.\n\n[Choice: The drive]",

The seats are so comfortable you almost feel like you're sinking into them, and the big touchscreen on the dashboard glows softly.\n\nJessica glances between you and Samantha in the rearview mirror. \"Do you guys mind if I put on some music?\"\n\n\"Depends,\" Samantha says from the back, arms crossed. \"Are we talking actual music, or whatever Top 100 nightmare cheer captains usually listen to?\"\n\nJessica doesn't flinch. She laughs lightly, though it's that practiced, breezy laugh you've heard her use in the hallways. \"Guess you'll have to find out.\"\n\nShe taps the screen, and some upbeat pop starts paying. It's not bad, but not good either. Just safe. Jessica bobs her head along like it's her go-to road trip soundtrack.\n\nSamantha leans forward, eyebrows raised. \"Called it. Radio-friendly jams. You really are on-brand, Sanders.\"\n\n\"Hey, it's catchy,\" Jessica says with a little shrug. \"Besides, it's hard to make everyone happy with music. This is a nice middle ground.\"\n\nSamantha leans back again, clearly unimpressed but not pushing it further. You can tell she's still in that evaluating phase—deciding if Jessica is actually someone she can tolerate or if she's just going to mentally file her away as \"perfect princess of Pacific Crest.\"\n\nYou decide to step in before the silence turns awkward. \"So, Jessica, I didn't even know you drove yourself to school. I've never seen this car in the lot.\"\n\nJessica glances at you, smiling. \"I try to get in and out without drawing too much attention.\"\n\nSamantha snorts. \"Oh sure. Because the cheer captain in the shiny new car is so inconspicuous.\"\n\nJessica doesn't take the bait. \"Fair,\" she says, smiling a little tighter. \"But I do my best.\"\n\nThere's a pause, just long enough for you to feel the tension creeping back in. Jessica keeps her eyes on the road and Samantha's staring out the window like she's already over it.\n\nYou clear your throat. \"You know, it's funny. I think this is the first time you two have actually talked.\"\n\n\"Yup,\" Samantha says without looking away from the window.\n\nJessica laughs again, but it's the practiced one. \"Guess we run in pretty different circles.\"\n\nSamantha finally turns to look at her. \"You could say that.\"\n\nAnother pause. And then Jessica—maybe intentionally—adds, \"I mean, it's kind of nice though, isn't it? Getting out of your bubble and meeting people you don't usually get to talk to.\"\n\nSamantha tilts her head like she's gauging if Jessica actually means it or if it's just one of those lines people like her say to sound nice. \"Do you actually believe that? Or are you doing your, like, Miss Popular thing right now?\"\n\nJessica's smile falters for the first time. She glances at Samantha in the rearview mirror, then back at the road. \"I mean it,\" she says simply. \"It's easy to get stuck being what people expect you to be. I like when I don't have to do that for a while.\"\n\nThat seems to catch Samantha off guard. \"Huh.\"\n\nYou don't say anything, but you notice Samantha's posture ease just slightly. Her arms loosen and her voice isn't as sharp when she speaks again.\n\n\"So, wait,\" Samantha says after a beat. \"You're telling me you don't enjoy the whole queen bee thing?\"\n\n\"Sometimes? Sure.\" Jessica chuckles, but this time it's more real. \"But it's a lot. People assume you've got it all figured out. And if you don't live up to that, it feels like you're failing at being... well, you.\"\n\nSamantha studies her like she's trying to decide whether to believe her. Then she finally leans back. \"That's... actually fair.\"\n\n\"Glad you think so,\" Jessica says, smiling softly.\n\nIt's quiet for a moment after that, but it's much lighter. It's as if everyone's settling in.\n\nYou glance between them, relieved. This is going better than you expected.\n\n[Choice: Ask Jessica what her favorite thing to do is when she's not busy]\n[Choice: Ask Samantha what music she actually likes]",

She looks composed as always—exactly the image people expect of her. But then you remember what she said a minute ago about being stuck in that image, and before you can overthink it, you speak up.\n\n \"So, Jessica,\" you say, leaning back in your seat, \"what's your favorite thing to do when you're not... you know, being cheer captain or busy with school? Like, actual free time stuff.\"\n\n She doesn't answer right away. You can see her expression flicker—something between hesitation and calculation. She opens her mouth like she's going to give the safe answer, the response people would expect from Jessica.\n\n But then she closes it again.\n\n \"I, uh...\" She exhales through her nose, shaking her head at herself, and then glances at you with a wry smile. \"You guys are gonna laugh.\"\n\n \"Oh, now you have to say it,\" Samantha pipes up from the back, leaning forward with sudden interest. \"If you preface it like that, it's definitely something juicy.\"\n\n Jessica groans, but it's more theatrical than serious. \"Okay. Fine. But don't tell anyone at school, seriously.\"\n\n \"I can't promise anything,\" Samantha says immediately.\n\n Jessica gives her a look through the rearview mirror. \"Samantha.\"\n\n \"Fine, fine. Scout's honor. I won't destroy your image.\"\n\n \"I...\" Jessica begins. She exhales like she's bracing for impact. \"I paint Waranvil minis.\"\n\n You blink. \"You what now?\"\n\n Jessica laughs—really laughs, a soft, slightly embarrassed sound. \"Yeah. You know, those tiny tabletop game figurines? I don't actually play the game, but I love painting them. It's calming. Kind of my escape when everything else going on is so chaotic. And I've actually gotten pretty good at it.\"\n\n \"You spend your free time hunched over a table painting tiny plastic dudes with guns?\" Samantha asks, her mouth hanging open.\n\n \"Yup,\" Jessica says, clearly cringing at herself. \"I even have one of those lamps and a cutting mat.\"\n\n There's a beat of silence, and then Samantha bursts out laughing—not in a mean way, but genuinely amused. \"Okay, that's actually kind of amazing. Like, I was expecting you to say 'yoga' or 'tennis with my friends at the country club.' Not, 'I paint tiny space knights in my room.' Respect.\"\n\n Jessica glances at her in the mirror, surprised. \"Respect?\"\n\n \"Yeah, that's way more interesting than what I thought you'd say,\" Samantha says, grinning. \"You've officially gained, like, one cool point. Don't let it get to your head.\"\n\n Jessica shakes her head, but there's a softness to her smile now. \"Hopefully I can earn some more.\"\n\n You can feel the tension in the car loosening, little by little. Jessica seems more relaxed too, shoulders settled and voice lighter. She doesn't have to keep performing.\n\n \"So, do you... collect them or just paint?\" you ask.\n\n \"Mostly paint,\" she admits. \"I've got a little box with a whole diorama I made inside of it. Finishing one is stupidly satisfying. Plus, nobody expects me to do it, so it feels like it's just... mine, you know? No judgment.\"\n\n \"That's... actually really cool,\" you say honestly.\n\n Jessica gives you a grateful smile, and for a moment, she looks less like your high school's perfect golden girl and more like an actual person—one who just happens to spend her free time geeking out over miniatures.\n\n \"Alright, Waranvil Jessica,\" Samantha says, leaning back with a grin. \"You're slowly convincing me you're not as insufferable as I thought.\"\n\n Jessica laughs again, shaking her head. \"You know what? I'll take it. That's high praise coming from you.\"\n\n The car settles into an easy quiet after that—the kind where it feels like everyone's a little more comfortable than they were five minutes ago.\n\n \n You glance at Samantha in the rearview mirror. She's slouched against the window, arms crossed like she's still deciding whether this trip is a good idea or if she's going to regret letting you drag her into it. Jessica hums softly along with the safe, upbeat pop playing through the speakers, her posture perfect, hands at nine and three like she's in a car commercial. The mood's... fine, but not quite relaxed.\n\n Fuck it.\n\n \"So, Sam,\" you say, twisting slightly in your seat to look back at her, \"what do you even listen to? You've been quietly judging Jessica's playlist since we left my house. What would you put on right now?\"\n\n She blinks at you before smirking. \"Oh, you mean real music? Paramore. Linkin Park. Evanescence. You know—stuff with actual feelings. Not this bubblegum background noise.\"\n\n Jessica glances at her in the rearview mirror, still smiling. \"You like Linkin Park?\"\n\n \"Obviously,\" Samantha says, sitting up a little straighter. \"Hybrid Theory is basically therapy. You can't tell me you've never screamed along to 'Crawling' before.\"\n\n \"Believe it or not, I actually have,\" Jessica replies, chuckling. \"I used to blast that in my room when I was, like, thirteen. Felt very rebellious at the time.\"\n\n Samantha blinks, surprised. \"Huh. Didn't expect that from Miss Cheer Captain.\"\n\n Jessica just shrugs, that perfect smile softening into something more playful. \"There's a lot you wouldn't expect.\" She takes a quick glance at her phone. \"Hey, Suri. Play Linkin Park.\"\n\n The speakers respond with a chime, then the quiet, melodic intro of \"What I've Done\" fills the car.\n\n \"Ohh,\" Samantha exclaims, grinning. \"Okay. You might actually live through this road trip.\"\n\n Jessica laughs as the beat kicks in. \"This one's a classic.\"\n\n Within seconds, Samantha's mouthing the words, then singing under her breath. By the time the chorus hits, she's basically performing.\n\n Jessica surprises you by chiming in too—not as loud, but knowing every word. She doesn't hold back on the drumming either, hitting the steering wheel in rhythm like she's done this a thousand times already.\n\n \"You know all the words to this?\" you ask, blinking at her.\n\n \"What, you think I only listen to cheer music?\" Jessica asks, smirking. \"Please. I had an emo phase like everyone else.\"\n\n Samantha barks a laugh. \"This I respect. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n \"There's a lot more to me than most people think.\"\n\n \"Alright, I'll give you that,\" Samantha says. \"Bonus points for actually knowing the lyrics.\"\n\n <<if [jessicaRomance] > 9>> \n \"Come on, [name],\" Jessica says, taking a hand off the steering wheel and putting a hand on your thigh. \"Don't leave us hanging. You have to sing too.\"\n \n \n \"Come on, [name],\" Jessica says, taking a hand off the steering wheel and putting a hand on your shoulder. \"Don't leave us hanging. You have to sing too.\"\n \n\n \"Oh, I don't—\" you start, but Samantha interrupts.\n\n \"Wrong answer. You are not too cool for LP.\"\n\n \"I never said I was too cool—\"\n\n \"Sing,\" she demands.\n\n And somehow, between the two of them staring you down, you do. Quietly at first, but by the second chorus, the three of you are yelling the lyrics together. Jessica's laughing between lines, Samantha's headbanging dramatically in the back seat, and for a few minutes, everything feels... easy.\n\n When the song ends, Samantha's still grinning, flushed from the impromptu jam session. \"Okay,\" she says, pointing at Jessica. \"You just gained, like, three cool points. Don't let it go to your head.\"\n\n \"I'll try not to,\" Jessica says, smiling genuinely.\n\n The tension in the car has shifted. It's not completely gone—Samantha's still Samantha and Jessica's still Jessica—but there's a new ease between them, like the gap just got a little smaller.\n\n And you? You can't help but think this is going way better than you expected.\n \n\n[Choice: Nearly there]",

Cargo shorts. White T-shirt. Those beat-up black Converse. It's your uniform. You're like... a video game character who doesn't change outfits.\"\n\n\"They're comfortable,\" you mutter, automatically defensive.\n\nJessica snickers from the driver's seat, glancing at you. \"Oh, I can confirm this. I think I've seen you in literally that exact outfit at least ten times since school started.\"\n\n\"You keep track?\" you ask.\n\n\"It's hard not to,\" she says with a grin, leaning her elbow on the door like she's settling in for this. \"Believe it or not, I actually thought it was endearing at first. Like, you know, you're committed to a look. But then I realized it wasn't a 'look.' It's just you wearing the first few things in your closet forever.\"\n\nSamantha cackles from the back seat. \"Thank you. Finally, someone else gets it.\"\n\nYou throw your hands up. \"Okay, hold on. First of all, I do wear other things.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" Samantha says, eyebrows raised.\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Like what?\" she fires back immediately.\n\nYou open your mouth, then close it. You can feel both of them staring at you, waiting.\n\n\"That's what I thought,\" Samantha says with smug satisfaction.\n\nYou roll your eyes, but there's a small grin tugging at your lips. \"Glad my wardrobe is providing endless entertainment for you two.\"\n\nJessica glances at you from the driver's seat, her teasing expression softening into something warmer. \"Hey, you know we're just messing with you, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Samantha adds, leaning forward between the seats. \"If we actually thought you were a hopeless case, we wouldn't bother trying. This is how we show love.\"\n\n\"So I'm basically your chew toy?\" you ask, chuckling.\n\n\"No, of course not,\" Jessica says. \"You're our friend. And we like you enough to want to help you out.\"\n\n\"If we didn't care, we'd just let you keep rocking the same clothes forever and never say a word,\" Samantha jokes.\n\n\"You deserve to feel good in what you wear, [name],\" Jessica states, her tone genuine. \"And if you've been stuck in the same thing for years, maybe it's time to try something new. We'll help you figure out what that is. That's why you invited us, right?\"\n\nSamantha leans back into her seat again, satisfied. \"By the end of today, you'll actually have options in your closet. It'll be historic.\"\n\nYou shake your head, smiling despite yourself. \"Alright, alright. I'm trusting you two.\"\n\nJessica grins. \"Good.

The conversation drifts into safer territory: little side comments about the neighborhoods you pass, Samantha's running commentary on terrible billboard designs, and Jessica humming along to the music.\n\nJessica turns into the mall's parking lot, easing the car into an open spot near the entrance. The glass facade reflects the late-afternoon sun, and streams of shoppers flow in and out of the big doors. She slips the car into park and exhales. \"Well,\" she says, unbuckling her seatbelt with a click. \"Here we are. Ground zero.\"\n\n\"Ground zero,\" Samantha repeats from the back, stretching her arms over her head. \"Wow. You really know how to hype up retail therapy.\"\n\nJessica glances back with a grin. \"I know a thing or two about it.\"\n\nSamantha's lips twitch like she's about to fire off another joke, but then she hesitates. Her gaze lingers on Jessica for a moment before she leans forward between the front seats. \"Hey,\" she says, her tone a little softer than usual, \"before we get out, I just wanted to say something.\"\n\nJessica raises an eyebrow. \"Oh?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Samantha tugs at the hem of her beanie, clearly a little awkward. \"I know I was kind of... prickly earlier. Maybe more than I needed to be.\"\n\nJessica tilts her head. \"Prickly?\"\n\n\"Fine, I was rude,\" Samantha admits with a dramatic sigh, like the confession physically pains her. \"I just... I didn't really know you. And when people are all bubbly and perfect, I guess I get defensive. It felt like you weren't being totally real with me.\"\n\nJessica studies her for just a moment before breaking out into a small smile. \"That's fair,\" she says simply. \"We didn't really know each other. And... honestly? You're not wrong. I wasn't being totally real. It's kind of a habit, putting on the version of me that people expect.\"\n\n\"Huh,\" Samantha says, not expecting the honesty. \"You're... not what I expected.\"\n\n\"I'll take that as a compliment,\" Jessica says.\n\n\"Don't push it,\" Samantha says, though there's no bite to her words now.\n\nJessica giggles, opening her door. \"Fine, I won't.\"\n\nYou glance between them, a little surprised at how naturally the tension dissolved. A couple of minutes ago, you weren't sure if they'd even survive the car ride together. Now? They're starting to understand each other.\n\nJessica grabs her purse and steps out of the car, stretching her arms. \"Come on,\" she says brightly. \"Let's make today productive.\"\n\nJessica steps out ahead as the three of you make your way across the lot. You and Samantha trail a little behind, falling into a slower pace without even thinking about it. Samantha shoves her hands into the pockets of her jeans, glancing at Jessica's back for a moment before leaning closer to you.\n\n\"I can see why you're friends with her now,\" she whispers, her tone quiet enough that Jessica won't hear.\n\n<<if [jessicaRomance] > 9>> \n You glance at Jessica, watching the way her ponytail sways as she walks, then quickly look away before Samantha can catch you staring. \"Yeah,\" you say, a little more thoughtful than you meant to. \"She's easy to get along with. Not really what I expected at first either.\"\n\n Samantha hums in agreement. \"Yup. I can tell.\"\n\n You keep your eyes fixed on the ground as you walk, a strange flutter sitting in your chest.\n\n You don't bother trying to name it.\n\n \n You shrug, kicking at a stray pebble as you walk. \"Yeah. She's just nice. Like, genuinely nice. Not what I expected when I first met her.\"\n\n Samantha nods, considering that. \"Yeah. Guess I judged too quick.\"\n\n \"Maybe a little,\" you tease.\n\n She smirks, elbowing you lightly. \"Don't get used to me admitting I was wrong, [name].\"\n \n\nUp ahead, Jessica glances over her shoulder with a bright smile. \"You two coming, or are you planning on loitering out here all day?\"\n\n\"Coming!\" Samantha calls back, tugging you along by the sleeve. And just like that, the three of you step through the doors together, into the cool, bustling air of the mall.\n\n[Choice: Mall time!]",

      "text": "The mall swallows you up in a rush of cool, manufactured air and the faint scent of cinnamon pretzels, fabric softener, and whatever cologne they're spraying at the men's department two stores down. It's a sudden shift from the sticky heat of outside to the sterile environment of retail therapy central. Floors polished so clean you can see the overhead lights reflecting, shoppers weaving in and out of storefronts, and ambient music pulsing softly from the ceiling.\n\nJessica slows her pace just inside the entrance, pulling out her phone. \"Okay,\" she says, voice bright. \"What we need is a plan.\"\n\nSamantha groans dramatically. \"A plan? What is this, a military op? We're just buying [name] some clothes.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Jessica says, smirking. \"At the end of the day, it is a mission. And like any good mission, we need a strategy. If we just wander around, we'll end up with him buying another boring outfit.\"\n\n\"I can feel the judgment radiating off that sentence,\" you mutter.\n\n\"We'll start with basics,\" Jessica says, scrolling through something on her phone. \"Stuff you can mix and match. Then maybe some layering pieces.\"\n\nSamantha tilts her head. \"Layering? Like scarves and jackets?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Jessica says, nodding. \"Things that make an outfit look intentional instead of... thrown on. We'll also have to pay attention to fit. That's half the battle. Too loose, and it looks sloppy. Too tight, and it looks uncomfortable. You need things that actually suit your frame.\"\n\n\"Fit,\" Samantha echoes, giving a solemn nod. \"That's important, yeah.\"\n\nJessica keeps going like she's running a seminar. \"Comfort matters too. If it doesn't feel right, you won't wear it. Which means we might need to look at thing like underlayers. Tanks, undershirts...\"\n\n\"Or a bra,\" Samantha interjects casually, like she's listing socks or belts.\n\nJessica nods in agreement, not missing a beat. \"Yeah, depending on how certain tops fit, that could make a huge difference.\"\n\nYou freeze mid-step.\n\nSamantha notices and glances at you, one eyebrow raised. \"Wait,\" she says, like the thought just hit her. \"Do you even have a bra?\"\n\nHer tone is just curious, like she's clearly expecting you to say yes.\n\nAnd suddenly, both of them are looking at you, waiting for your answer.\n\n \n \n You hesitate, feeling the weight of their stares. The question lingers longer than it should, and finally, you exhale. \"Uh... no. I don't... I don't have one. I've been using a binder.\"\n\n That stops them both dead. Jessica's lips part in surprise, and Samantha stands up straighter like she didn't quite hear you right.\n\n \"A... binder?\" Samantha repeats, blinking. \"Like... a real one? That squishes your boobs to make you flat?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, rubbing the back of your neck. \"Coach Blake got it for me about ten days ago.\"\n\n Jessica's eyebrows shoot up, her eyes softening. \"Coach Blake? Wait, the Coach Blake? The one who yells at us for not running hard enough in P.E.?\"\n\n You can't help but huff a little laugh despite the tension creeping up your chest. \"Yeah. That Coach Blake. She kind of... noticed I was having a hard time during a run. Pulled me aside and asked if I had a proper binder. I told her no. A few minutes later, she had one for me.\"\n\n \"That's... actually really kind of her,\" Jessica says, her expression sympathetic.\n\n \"It was,\" you admit quietly.\n\n Samantha, on the other hand, doesn't look softened at all. Her jaw tightens, and she stares at you like you just admitted you jumped out of a moving car for fun. \"And you've been wearing it all the time every single day?\"\n\n You nod cautiously. \"Pretty much.\"\n\n Her face twists into disbelief, and her voice comes out sharper than you've heard all day. \"[name]. How could you have done that?!\"\n\n \"I—\"\n\n \"No, seriously.\" She gestures at you wildly, the way she does when she's worked up. \"Did you even look up how long you're supposed to wear it? How dangerous that is?\"\n\n \"Samantha,\" Jessica interrupts gently, her tone like a steadying hand.\n\n Samantha groans, running her hands down her face. \"Dude, I can't believe you. You can't just put something like that on and wear it like it's a T-shirt. It's not safe. What if you hurt yourself?\"\n\n You blink, thrown off by the raw edge of her words. She's mad—but you can tell she's not mad at you. She's just worried.\n\n \"I didn't think it was a big deal,\" you say, quieter than you meant to.\n\n Jessica shakes her head immediately. \"Look, [name],\" she says softly, her voice full of kindness. \"Of course it's a big deal. You've been hurting yourself just to get by. That's not okay. You shouldn't have to do that.\"\n\n You glance away, focusing on the shiny tile floor ahead. \"It's just... helpful. Makes me feel better. I figured some pain was just normal.\"\n\n Jessica steps closer and lays a hand lightly on your shoulder. \"It's not supposed to hurt like that. If it does, it probably means it's too tight or that you've been wearing it too long. I don't want you thinking you just have to live with pain like that. You don't.\"\n \n Samantha lets out a frustrated noise and crosses her arms, glaring at nothing in particular. \"I can't believe you didn't say anything. You should've told me. You know I would've—\" She cuts herself off, shaking her head like she's too wound up to finish.\n\n \"Sam,\" Jessica chides gently, but there's no real heat in it.\n\n \"Look, he's my best friend,\" Samantha says, her voice cracking. \"You don't get to just... silently hurt yourself and not tell me.\"\n\n Jessica keeps her hand on your shoulder, her thumb brushing in a small but reassuring motion. \"She's just worried. We both are.\"\n\n \"I didn't want to make it a big thing,\" you murmur.\n\n Jessica's smile doesn't waver. \"You don't have to make it a big thing. You just have to take care of yourself. That's all we want.\"\n\n \"Exactly,\" Samantha cuts in. Her voice is still sharp, albeit less than before. \"And step one of that is getting you an actual bra. One that's comfortable and doesn't hurt you. No arguments.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" Jessica agrees softly, squeezing your shoulder before letting her hand finally fall. \"You deserve to feel good and safe in your clothes. We're not leaving until we make that happen.\"\n\n You stare at the two of them—Samantha shaking like she's ready to fight the binder and Jessica smiling reassuringly—and for the first time, it really sinks in that they're here for you.\n \n \n You freeze for a moment, feeling both their eyes on you. There's no way to make this sound good, but lying would feel worse. So you take a breath and admit it.\n\n \"...No. I don't,\" you say quietly. \"I've just been... using a towel to flatten my chest.\"\n\n Jessica blinks like she didn't hear you right. \"A... towel?\"\n\n Samantha leans forward between the seats, frowning. \"What do you mean, a towel? Like, actually—\"\n\n You cut in quickly. \"Yeah. I just fold it and... wrap it tight. It works well enough.\"\n\n There's a pause—an awful, stretched silence where both of them are clearly processing that.\n\n Samantha is the first to speak, and her voice isn't as sharp as you expected. \"[name],\" she says slowly, like she's trying to figure out how not to shout. \"You've been doing that this whole time?\"\n\n You shrug weakly, staring down at the tiles under your feet. \"Yeah.\"\n\n Jessica recovers next, and her usual energy is nowhere to be found. \"That can't be comfortable,\" she says softly. \"Doesn't it hurt?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, letting out a small laugh that dies almost instantly. \"I mean, it digs in and it's hard to breathe sometimes if I make it too tight. But it makes me feel better. People don't stare at me.\"\n\n \"[name], that's dangerous,\" Jessica says firmly, taking a step closer. \"Towels aren't meant to do that. That can really hurt you.\"\n\n \"I know,\" you mumble.\n\n Samantha groans and presses her hands to her face, dragging them down with a frustrated sigh. \"God, [name]. Why didn't you tell me? why didn't you tell anyone? You can't just do stuff like this to yourself and keep it secret.\"\n\n Her words sting, but not in a cruel way. You can hear the worry in her voice.\n\n \"I didn't want it to be a big deal,\" you say. \"And it works. Mostly.\"\n\n Jessica meets your eyes. \"You don't have to live with pain just because it makes other things easier. You deserve to be comfortable and safe.\"\n\n You glance away, unsure what to do with the warmth in her words.\n\n Samantha exhales, crossing her arms. \"Look. I'm not mad, I'm just freaked out that you'd hurt yourself like this and not even say anything. You're my best friend. I'm supposed to look out for you, and I can't do that if you keep this stuff to yourself.\"\n\n You manage a small nod, and that seems to ease her a little.\n\n \"Okay,\" Jessica states, her tone shifting from gentle to decisive. \"First things first, we're getting you a bra. A proper one. Something soft and supportive that doesn't hurt you. No arguments.\"\n\n Samantha nods firmly. \"Yup. That's priority number one. The towel stops today.\"\n\n \"We'll help you figure this out,\" Jessica says with a reassuring smile. \"You don't have to do it alone.\"\n\n You swallow hard, looking between the two of them. They're serious—more serious than you've ever seen them about anything. They really do care. And somehow, even with the knot in your chest, that makes you feel a little better.\n \n\n \n \n You shift your weight, feeling both of their eyes on you. \"No,\" you admit after a moment, \"I don't have one.\"\n\n \"Really?\" Jessica asks, tilting her head.\n\n \"Really,\" you say, shrugging. \"I just... didn't think I needed one.\"\n\n Samantha peers at you like she's trying to figure out if you're serious. \"You've been going to school like this for weeks, looking like you do now, and you never thought to get one?\"\n\n \n You shrug again, awkward but honest. \"My chest is still... well, flat. Like, actually flat. There's nothing there to even need one for.\"\n \n \n You shrug again, awkward but honest. \"My chest is still... well, flat. Like, basically flat. There's nothing there to even need one for.\"\n \n\n Jessica blinks, her expression softening as she processes that. \"Oh. Okay. That makes sense.\"\n\n \"Alright, fair,\" Samantha says. \"But still.\"\n\n \"Still what?\" you ask, glancing at her.\n\n <<if [feminineLooks] > 59>> \n She gestures vaguely toward you. \"You don't exactly look like 'old [name]' anymore. You've got more of a tomboy vibe now—like, you look like a girl who just happens to dress casual. A bra might help make your outfits sit better, even if you don't need it for support.\"\n <<elseif [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n She gestures vaguely toward you. \"You don't exactly look like 'old [name]' anymore. You've got this really androgynous thing going on now—like, depending on the outfit, people might read you either way. A bra might help pull the look together a bit. Even if you don't need it for support, it could make your clothes fit cleaner.\"\n \n\n \"She's right,\" Jessica says, nodding in agreement. \"It's not about need—it's about comfort and how your clothes sit on you. Some tops will look a lot smoother with a bra under them, even if it's just something light and soft.\"\n\n You glance down at your top, suddenly a little more aware of how it hangs on you. \"I guess I didn't think about it that way.\"\n\n \"That's what we're here for,\" Jessica says, smiling warmly. \"It doesn't have to be anything complicated. Just something simple that feels good and works with what you're wearing.\"\n\n Samantha grins. \"Operation Closet Rescue expands. First stop: Bras.\"\n\n You groan lightly at the way she says it, but for the first time, the idea doesn't feel so strange. Maybe, with them, it might not be so bad.\n \n \n \n \n If Jessica is the one who gave you the bra, she won't acknowledge it. This is because I forgot to put a variable there, so there's no way to check. Sorry!\n \n\n \"Uh... actually,\" you say, scratching the back of your neck, \"I do have one. Kind of. A sports bra.\"\n\n Samantha pauses. \"Oh?\" she asks. \"Where'd you get it from?\"\n\n \"Someone gave it to me,\" you say, keeping it vague. \"It wasn't really... fitted for me or anything like that. They just thought it might help, I guess.\"\n\n \"So it's just random?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you admit. \"The band is a little too tight and the strap's too loose. But it works well enough.\"\n\n Jessica's brow furrows as she listens. \"[name], that doesn't sound like it actually works at all.\"\n\n You glance down, suddenly feeling very aware of yourself in the crowded space. \"It's... better than nothing.\"\n\n Samantha makes a face, the kind she reserves for when she's trying to be supportive but can't quite mask her bluntness. \"Better than nothing isn't good enough if it's uncomfortable. You've been wearing that this whole time?\"\n\n \"Mostly,\" you say. \"It doesn't really bother me much.\"\n\n \"You shouldn't have to settle for that,\" Jessica states, shaking her head. \"A proper fit makes a huge difference.\"\n\n Samantha nods. \"Exactly, and you can't just take whatever hand-me-down someone tosses you and call it good. It's like wearing shoes that are a size too small and convincing yourself it's fine because they stay on your feet.\"\n\n You shrug again, unsure what to say. \"I didn't think it was that big a deal.\"\n\n \"It is,\" Jessica says simply, like there's no debate to be had.\n\n \"Yeah,\" Samantha agrees. \"We're not letting you walk around in some mystery sports bra forever. Today, we're fixing that.\"\n\n \"Luckily for you, I know exactly where to go,\" Jessica says, already glancing toward the mall directory. \"We'll find something simple, comfy, and actually fitted for you. You deserve that much.\"\n\n Samantha bumps your shoulder lightly. \"Don't worry. We'll make it quick and painless. Probably. Depends on how indecisive you are.\"\n\n \"And I promise it doesn't have to be anything fancy,\" Jessica says, giggling. \"Just something that feels right.\"\n\n You look between the two of them, and the idea of actually getting one doesn't feel embarrassing or overwhelming anymore. It just feels... doable.\n \n \n You hesitate for a second. There's no easy way to say it, but you figure honesty's better than letting them keep guessing.\n\n \"...No,\" you finally admit. \"I don't have one. No sports bra, no anything. I just... don't wear one.\"\n\n \"Wait,\" Samantha says, eyes wide. \"Hold on. You mean to tell me you've been walking around like this with nothing? Just letting them hang there?\"\n\n You flush, suddenly wishing you'd kept your mouth shut. \"Yeah. I mean... I didn't think it was that big of a deal. They're not even that—\"\n\n \"[name],\" Samantha cuts you off. \"What the fuck, dude. You need support. That's, like, basic. How do you even move around without wanting to die? Doesn't that hurt?\"\n\n You look down at your top, a little defensive. \"Not... really? Sometimes, I guess. It can be uncomfortable though. I just try not to think about it.\"\n\n Jessica steps closer, her usual energy dimmed by a kind of quiet seriousness you don't see often. \"[name], that's not good for you,\" she says gently but firmly.\n\n \"What do you mean?\" you ask, a little startled by how serious she sounds.\n\n \"Not having any support for your chest can cause all kinds of problems,\" she explains. \"It's not just about comfort. It can actually mess with your posture, cause pain in your back and shoulders, and even affect how your chest develops. It's really not good to go without.\"\n\n Samantha nods, crossing her arms. \"Yeah, and you're not exactly flat anymore. You can't just ignore them. You need a bra. You've needed a bra for a while now.\"\n\n \"I didn't know it was that serious,\" you admit.\n\n Jessica softens at that, her voice gentler now. \"I know. It's one of those things no one really explains, but it makes a huge difference. Even a simple bra will help you feel more supported and make moving around wayyy more comfortable.\"\n\n \"And lucky for you, we're in the perfect place to fix this,\" Samantha says. \"First stop: bra store. We're not letting you walk around like this any longer.\"\n\n \"I know it's scary,\" Jessica says, \"but I promise it'll make a difference.\"\n\n You swallow, the mix of embarrassment and relief settling in your chest. \"Alright,\" you say quietly. \"You guys know better than I do. Lead the way.\"\n\n Samantha claps you on the back, grinning. \"You're gonna thank us later. Trust me.\"\n\n And just like that, you find yourself following them. You try not to think too hard about how surreal this all feels. After all, it might just be exactly what you need.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Bra store]",

      "text": "As you step into Blink + Shine, it's like crossing an invisible border into a parallel dimension—one where everything is soft, glowy, and smells faintly like peach gummies. The lighting is gentle and warm, like its designed to make you feel pretty just for existing. Even the floor seems to muffle your footsteps, like the store is trying not to startle you. Everywhere you look, there are racks of neatly spaced chiffon blouses, high-waisted trousers in pastel shades, ruffled skirts, and gauzy cardigans.\n\nSamantha comes to a halt two steps behind you, arms crossed, jaw already tense.\n\n\"Oh, great,\" she says flatly, voice dripping with sarcasm. \"We've entered the afterlife. It's... pink. I hate it.\"\n\nYou glance back at her. \"It's not that bad.\"\n\n\"No, [name]. This isn't a store,\" she says, scanning the frilly displays with narrowed eyes. \"This is a place where they turn chiffon into clothes for girls who want to look delicate and artsy.\"\n\nJessica steps lightly past both of you, her eyes sweeping the store with an air of familiarity. \"No need to be so dramatic. Blink + Shine's... fine,\" she says with an easy shrug. \"Not NovaTrend good, but fine. Like a solid B-tier. I've gotten a couple of cute pieces here.\"\n\n\"B-tier?\" Samantha scoffs. \"It's not even on the list. Negative tier or something. There isn't a single hoodie in this whole place. That's a war crime.\"\n\nJessica doesn't even look at her, already browsing a rack of pale yellow sundresses. \"That's because this isn't a hoodie kind of store. Not everything has to look like you're about to go loiter in a parking lot.\"\n\n\"Loitering has aesthetic value,\" Samantha shoots back.\n\nYou snort, unable to help it. \"Do you two need me to get popcorn, or...?\"\n\nJessica waves a hand dismissively. \"This isn't a fight. I'm just saying it's nice for what it is. You just have to know what you're looking for.\"\n\nSamantha mutters, \"Yeah, what I'm looking for is the exit.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on,\" Jessica says with a smirk. \"You act like just touching a blouse is going to kill you.\"\n\n\"Not kill me,\" Samantha replies, leaning closer to a particularly frilly display of ruffled blouses and narrowing her eyes. \"But I'm pretty sure this one would insult me in French.\"\n\n\"I mean, maybe it'd be right,\" you mutter under your breath.\n\nSamantha points at you without looking away from the blouse. \"You're dangerously close to getting abandoned in here.\"\n\nYou step a little farther into the score, scanning the walls until something catches your eye—a softly glowing wall of accessories near the back, glimmering under the perfect lighting. Rows of earrings shaped like tiny stars, layered necklaces, glossy hair clips, and more. It's like its inviting you to look closer.\n\n\"I might go check out the accessory wall,\" you say, gesturing toward it.\n\nJessica follows your line of sight and nods. \"Good choice. Honestly, their accessories are usually better than their clothes.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Samantha sighs dramatically. \"We've reached the phase of the trip where [name] gets distracted by shiny things. Classic.\"\n\nYou glance back at her. \"You don't have to come with me, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm coming,\" Samantha says quickly. \"Someone's gotta supervise you. Make sure you don't walk out of here with a bedazzled belt or something. I promised to help you shop, and I take my promises very seriously.\"\n\n\"Sam, if he walks out with a bedazzled belt, that's between him and his new personality,\" Jessica says. \"Let him explore.\"\n\n\"Explore,\" Samantha repeats, skeptically. \"That's what we're calling it now.\"\n\nYou roll your eyes, but you can't help smiling as you start toward the accessories section in the back.\n\n\"I swear to God, if anything in this corner tries to sparkle at me, I'm leaving you here to fend for yourself,\" Samantha mutters.\n\nYou crack a grin, but your eyes linger on the wall.\n\nMaybe you'll go take a look.\n\nOr maybe you won't.\n\n[Choice: Head toward the accessories]\n[Choice: Decide to leave the store]",

      "text": "You look at the accessories wall. It's a little less threatening from the rest of the store—less commitment, more possibilities. Everything's arranged in neat little rows: tiny hair clips shaped like fruit, sparkling pins, pastel scrunchies, earrings dangling from gold hooks.\n\n \"Yeah, I have to check that section out,\" you murmur, already drifting toward it.\n\n \"Good call,\" Jessica says. \"Accessories make or break an outfit. It's the details people notice more than you think.\"\n\n Samantha sighs with all the theatrical flair of someone being led to her doom. \"Of course you'd say that,\" she says, arms still crossed like she's bracing for impact. \"Let it be known I followed you willingly into the Kingdom of Glitter. May history remember me as a good friend who died for the cause.\"\n\n You glance back at her. \"Died?\"\n\n \"Spiritually,\" she says flatly. \"My soul can only take so much exposure to fruit-shaped hair clips before it gives up and ascends.\"\n\n Jessica gives her a look. \"You're being dramatic. It's not that bad.\"\n\n Samantha stares at her, then gestures vaguely toward the pastel chaos of Blink + Shine. \"Jessica. There are scrunchies here that look like they belong in a dollhouse, and I think the wall of headbands is judging me. If this isn't hostile territory, I don't know what is.\"\n\n You pick up a lavender hairtie and give it an experimental tug. You turn your attention to the little container of hair ties. Four types sit coiled like soft spirals:\n\n <ul> \n <li>A plain elastic</li>\n <li>A simple ribbon</li>\n <li>A bunny ears ribbon</li>\n <li>A scrunchie</li>\n </ul> \n\n \"I don't get how people deal with long hair,\" Samantha mutters. \"You wash it, you dry it, you tie it, you try to make it not look like a bird nestled in it overnight—and then what? Some wind comes along and ruins it in two seconds anyway.\"\n\n \"Long hair isn't that hard if you know what you're doing,\" Jessica says. \"It's actually pretty easy to manage once you get a routine down. Conditioner's non-negotiable, obviously, and a good scalp oil makes a huge difference.\"\n\n You blink at her. \"Scalp oil? That's a thing?\"\n\n Jessica nods like this is common knowledge everyone should have. \"Oh, totally. If your scalp is dry or unhealthy, your hair's going to suffer. Oils help keep it balanced and hydrated. Plus, regular brushing helps distribute the natural oils so it stays shiny. And you have to trim it regularly. Split ends are the enemy.\"\n\n \"Okay, but how about tying it up? Like... doesn't that just pull on it all the time?\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head, reaching up to adjust the maroon hairtie holding her ponytail in place. \"It really depends on how you do it. Ponytails are totally fine if you don't yank them too tight or sleep in them. I like using ribbons like this or scrunchies 'cause they're gentler on the hair. And if you braid it at night, it won't tangle as much. It's all about balance, to be honest. You're meant to treat your hair like it's delicate, but not like it's untouchable.\"\n\n \"God, that sounds exhausting,\" Samantha says, pulling her beanie lower over her short, choppy hair. \"I wake up, put on a beanie, and go about my day. My hair hasn't seen oil, or a 'routine,' or whatever the hell you just described in, like, ever. And guess what? It's fine.\"\n\n Jessica side-eyes her, not missing a beat. \"It's fine because you've basically opted out of having a style. Beanies are just hiding whatever's going on under there.\"\n\n \"They're efficient,\" Samantha counters. \"Plus, the beanie is my style.\"\n\n \"I mean... she's not wrong,\" you say. \"I've never once seen Sam without a beanie.\"\n\n \"Exactly!\" Samantha beams. \"It's part of the brand. No beanie, no Samantha.\"\n\n \"You two are impossible,\" Jessica says, although there's a faint smile tugging at her lips. \"Look, I'm not saying everyone has to have a ten-step hair routine, but even a little effort goes a long way. Long hair frames your face differently. It can soften or sharpen your features depending on the cut and color. It's way more versatile than short hair since you can experiment, change things up, play with your look, all that stuff.\"\n\n Samantha groans, crossing her arms even tighter. \"Or you could just have short hair and save yourself the TED talk.\"\n \n You glance back at the wall of hair pins. \"Maybe I'll just start small. Accessories seem... easy.\"\n\n [Choice: Try some accessories on]\n\n \n \n \n You glance once more toward the accessories wall. All those glittering pastel trinkets and softly glowing displays. The racks of lavender hair ties. The earrings shaped like strawberries and clouds.\n\n You take exactly one step forward.\n\n And then stop.\n\n Nope.\n\n You pivot on your heel and head back toward the entrance without a word.\n\n Samantha perks up immediately. \"Wait—are we leaving? Are you leaving?\"\n\n You nod. \"Yeah. It's not really... for me.\"\n\n She exhales in exaggerated, performative relief. \"Thank God. I thought I was gonna die in there.\"\n\n Jessica, who'd been lazily sifting through a rack of cropped sweaters, looks up immediately. \"Really? You're not even going to look?\" Her tone isn't judgmental, just mildly disappointed. \"That's kind of a shame. They've got some nice stuff back there if you take a minute.\"\n\n \"Just not feeling it,\" you say.\n\n Jessica studies you for a second longer, but eventually decides to let it drop with a faint sigh. \"Fine, I guess. One day, you're going to regret walking away from a perfectly good wall of accessories.\"\n\n \"Doubt it,\" Samantha pipes up. \"This place is a minefield of ruffles and vibes I can't handle. I was starting to think you'd make me stand here while you tried on pearl-studded hair clips.\"\n\n Jessica shoots her a look. \"God forbid anyone try to soften your aesthetic for five seconds.\"\n\n \"I'll have you know, my aesthetic is perfect,\" Samantha says with a big smirk on her face. \"Zero ruffles. Zero pastels. One hundred percent survivable.\"\n\n \"Survivable isn't exactly aspirational,\" Jessica says, breezing past her toward the exit.\n\n You open the door and step out, letting the soft, peachy scent of Blink + Shine fall away as you step back into the louder, brighter expanse of the mall.\n\n Jessica glances at you as she pushes her hair behind one ear. \"Still, though. Next time, you should at least give it a chance. Accessories are the easiest way to try something new without committing to a whole look.\"\n\n \"Next time,\" you echo, though you're not sure you mean it.\n\n Samantha, already walking a few paces ahead, throws up a hand in mock celebration. \"Victory for the hoodie-wearing population. We live to fight another day.\"\n\n Jessica shakes her head. \"You're impossible.\"\n\n \"And yet, beloved,\" Samantha quips.\n\n You chuckle under your breath as you fall into step between them. Maybe you didn't walk out with anything new, but at least you tried going inside.\n\n And right now, that feels like enough.\n\n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

      "text": "<<if [transgender] > 14>> \n Maya's back at the register when you approach. Her smile blooms the second she sees the clothes in your arms—like she's genuinely proud of your picks, like she's seen this kind of decision before and knows just how much it means.\n\n \"Ooh, good choices,\" she says, reaching for the items with a practiced ease. She scans them one by one, folding them gently. \"You'll pull them off well, I can feel it.\"\n\n You laugh, flush warming your face. \"Thanks.\"\n\n Jessica standing just behind you, nods approvingly \"Honestly? You've got an eye for this stuff. Those pieces are super versatile. I told you Blink + Shine isn't that bad.\"\n\n Samantha leans an elbow on the counter, letting out a loud, fake sigh. \"Don't encourage him,\" she says to Jessica. \"Do you realize what's happening here? I've officially lost my best friend to the pastel abyss. First it was hairpins. Now it's high-waisted shorts and flowy dresses. Next thing you know, I'm gonna come over and there'll be scented candles, bath bombs, and a Pinterest board.\"\n\n Maya doesn't miss a beat. \"Honestly? Sounds like a glow-up to me.\"\n\n \"You are not helping,\" Samantha groans, but she's grinning as she says it.\n\n \"See?!\" Jessica says. \"Even the staff agrees.\"\n\n You pull out your phone and tap it against the reader. The soft ding confirms the purchase with a satisfying finality. Maya slides your receipt into the bag and then passes it across the counter.\n\n \"Thanks for trusting yourself,\" she says, quiet now, like it's just between the two of you. \"You looked good. I hope it made you feel good too.\"\n\n You meet her eyes, and you don't need to say anything. You just nod.\n\n Then you're heading toward the door, Samantha trailing behind you with the most dramatic limp you've ever seen.\n\n \"Do you feel that?\" she says as you push open the door. \"The tragedy? The betrayal? The estrogen in the air?\"\n\n \"Isn't there estrogen in your body?\" Jessica fires.\n\n Samantha doesn't even bother responding.\n\n You laugh.\n\n \"Look, you look happy,\" Jessica says. \"That's what matters.\"\n\n You smile at that. \"Yeah. I kind of am.\"\n\n Samantha walks a few paces ahead, then spins around to face you. \"Happy? He's glowing! [name], just yesterday, you were a humble peasant in cargo shorts and a T-shirt. Today? A goddess in linen.\"\n\n \"Should I be offended or flattered?\"\n\n \"Yes,\" she says.\n\n You keep going and you feel lighter, not just because of the bag swinging at your side, but because of something else entirely. Something that feels like permission. Like maybe, just maybe, you're starting to let yourself be exactly who you are.\n\n \n You walk up to the counter with the clothes in your arms, the folded items inside feeling heavier than they should. They're not even that flashy—just a couple of things, nothing major—but now they feel like they're glowing in the bag, practically announcing themselves.\n\n Maya looks up from the register with a mellow smile and reaches for your bag. \"All set?\" she asks.\n\n You nod, tight-lipped. \"Yeah.\"\n\n She doesn't push, just scans the items quickly. \"These are cute picks. Nice touch of colors.\"\n You force a little smile, the kind that doesn't quite reach your eyes. \"Thanks.\"\n\n Maya slides the receipt into a bag and hands it back to you. \"Hope they treat you well,\" she says kindly. \"And thanks for stopping by.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you murmur. \"You too.\"\n\n You turn, clutching the bag a little too tight, and head for the exit. Samantha and Jessica fall in step beside you immediately, no hesitation.\n\n None of you speaks at first.\n\n The bright hum of Blink + Shine fades as the door swings shut behind you, replaced with the colder, wider air of the mall corridor. The peach scent and soft lighting give way to the polished tile and overhead fluorescents.\n\n Jessica watches you out of the corner of her eye as you grip the bag tightly, your knuckles whitening around the handle. \"You okay?\" Jessica asks, voice softer now.\n\n You keep walking a few paces before muttering, \"I don't know. It just... feels dumb. Buying all that. Like it wasn't me.\"\n\n Jessica frowns, but Samantha gets there first. \"You're not dumb,\" she says bluntly. \"You tried something new. Sometimes it clicks. Sometimes it feels like trying on someone else's skin. That's just how it is.\"\n\n \"That's an oddly insightful way to put it,\" you say, glancing at her.\n\n \"I contain multitudes,\" Samantha says with a deadpan expression. \"Also, you didn't burst into flames wearing it, so that's a win in my book.\"\n\n Jessica adds, \"And even if it wasn't your style, that's fine. You don't have to get it perfect.\"\n\n \"I guess,\" you say, breathing out slowly.\n\n \"Hey, I promise, nobody's keeping score,\" Jessica says with an encouraging smile. \"You just bought some clothes. That's all.\"\n\n Samantha smirks. \"And if you ever want to ceremonially burn them, I've got matches somewhere in my pockets.\"\n\n That earns her an actual laugh from you.\n\n You walk a little slower as the bag swings at your side, the weight still there but not quite as suffocating. You don't know if the clothes will ever feel like you, but between Samantha and Jessica, the heaviness doesn't feel quite so unbearable.\n\n And for now, that's enough.\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

      "text": "You stand in front of the accessory mirror, the lavender hairpin resting between your fingers like it weighs more than it should. It doesn't, of course—it's barely a whisper in your grip. But your hand hesitates anyway, hovering just above your head, like you're waiting to be given permission.\n\nYou don't get any.\n\nSo you breathe in, tilt your head, and snap the pin into place.\n\nThe change is small—subtle enough you're not even sure it's visible. But it does something to your silhouette in the mirror. Softens it. Shifts it just enough that you pause, unsure what you're seeing. It's not better or worse, just... different.\n\nJessica appears at your side, catching your eye in the mirror. \"Oh, that actually works,\" she says, smiling softly. \"It frames your face in a nice way. Lavender's a good choice for you.\"\n\nYou glance at her, surprised by how casual and certain she sounds. \"You really think so?\"\n\n\"Definitely.\" She reaches up to adjust her own maroon hairtie, the one holding her ponytail neatly in place. \"Lavender softens your features and draws attention to the eyes. I think it suits you.\"\n\nBehind you, Samantha lets out a long, theatrical groan.\n\n\"Oh my God,\" she says, flinging her arms out like she's been hit by wave of invisible glitter. \"It's over. You've crossed into the sparkle realm. I've lost my best friend.\"\n\nYou roll your eyes. \"It's one hairpin, Sam.\"\n\n\"One lavender hairpin,\" she corrects, voice climbing half an octave in mock horror. \"That's the gateway drug, [name]. Next thing you know, you're wearing flower crowns and watching makeup tutorials at 2 a.m.\"\n\nJessica laughs. \"You're acting like that's a bad thing. Accessories are supposed to be fun.\"\n\n\"Fun for you, maybe,\" Samantha retorts. \"I can barely keep this beanie straight on my head, let alone wear one of those dainty little ribbons.\"\n\nYou snort. \"You literally wore glitter eyeliner to the school dance once.\"\n\n\"That was different,\" she says, tossing her head. \"That was battle armor. And besides, I balanced it out with ripped jeans and, like, combat boots. It was a look.\"\n\n\"Not a bad one,\" Jessica admits, giving Samantha a half-smile.\n\nSamantha waves her off like she doesn't want the compliment, even though she does.\n\nYou turn toward the little display beside the mirror. Four types of lavender hair ties sit in a tray: a plain elastic, a soft ribbon, one with floppy bunny ears, and a plush scrunchie. You reach out, gently poking at them one by one.\n\nSamantha leans down to inspect the display like she's evaluating evidence at a crime scene.\n\n\"You planning to put your hair up with one of those?\" she asks.\n\n\"Maybe,\" you say, because you honestly don't know.\n\nShe makes a noise like a dying cat. \"Ugh. Long hair. Why would you want that kind of responsibility?\"\n\n \n \"I already have long hair,\" you remind her.\n\n \"Yeah, and I've been meaning to stage an intervention,\" she shoots back. \"You know how easy it is to live your life when you don't wake up with a tangled bird's nest on your head? You just exist. You just vibe. You throw on a beanie and call it fashion.\"\n\n You glance at her. \"You wear the same beanie like every day.\"\n\n \"Its called a signature look,\" she says. \"Learn some culture.\"\n\n \n \"I don't have long hair,\" you say. \"It's like... medium.\"\n\n Samantha snorts. \"Medium is just long that's pretending it's still low-maintenance. That stuff tangles if you breathe wrong.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"I do brush it, you know.\"\n\n \"Barely,\" she fires back. \"You need a whole hair care routine and a support group just to make that length work.\"\n\n \"You literally wear a beanie.\"\n\n \"It's called having a brand,\" she says, flicking her fingers. \"Try to keep up.\"\n\n \n \"I don't need hair ties,\" you point out, brushing your hand over your head. \"It's already short.\"\n\n Samantha gives you a dry look. \"Yeah, but you look like you keep it short for convenience. I keep mine short for the aesthetic. Huge difference.\"\n\n You snort. \"You're in a graphic tee and a beanie right now.\"\n\n \"And still somehow serving,\" she says, striking a dramatic pose. \"Minimal effort, maximum style. Meanwhile, you're out here debating hair accessories like it's a moral crisis.\"\n\n \"Maybe I'm just evolving,\" you say, shrugging.\n\n \"Then evolve faster,\" she says. \"Your final form better be iconic.\"\n \n\nYou reach down and pick up the bunny ears hair tie. You twirl it between your fingers, letting it dangle.\n\n\"I don't know,\" you murmur. \"It is kind of cute.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well,\" she mutters, glancing off to the side. \"It's not like anyone else should get to tell you what to wear, right?\"\n\nYou blink at her.\n\n\"What?\" she snaps, a little too quickly. \"I can be supportive.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" you say, still spinning the ribbon slowly.\n\n\"Just don't expect me to get matching ones,\" she says. \"My hair tie phase died in elementary school.\"\n\nYou grin. \"So you had a phase?\"\n\n\"No comment.\"\n\nYou turn back to the mirror, the ribbon still in your hand, the lavender pin glinting faintly in your hair. The shop's lighting is soft here—almost too gentle compared to the rest of the mall. There's no pressure to do anything. But there is an invitation.\n\nAnd for once, you think you might say yes.\n\n[Choice: Time to buy!]",

Like a nudge toward a version of yourself that's been hovering just out of reach.\n\nSamantha lingers a few steps behind as you quietly head toward the counter. She doesn't say anything at first, just trails behind with her hands stuffed into her pockets like she's forced to be here. Which, to be fair, she kind of is.\n\nYou place your choices on the counter. Whatever they are, they feel like the right ones. The sales associate, Maya, appears with a practiced ease, her bracelets giving a soft clatter as she starts scanning your items.\n\nJessica watches you from a few feet away, her expression soft. \"That's actually cute,\" she says, nodding toward your choice. \"It works for you. Subtle, but still makes a statement.\"\n\nYou glance at her. \"That's a lot of thought for a hair thingie or whatever.\"\n\n\"Accessories are underrated,\" she says with a little grin. \"They're like punctuation, if you think about it. Tiny, but capable of changing the entire vibe. You'll see what I mean.\"\n\nSamantha lingers a few steps behind as you quietly head toward the counter. She doesn't say anything at first, just trails behind with her hands stuffed into her pockets like she's being forced to witness some great tragedy.\n\nYou place your choices on the counter.

Joining the ranks of the accessorized. Never thought I'd see the day.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Is that your official review?\"\n\n\"Hey, I'm impressed,\" she says, folding her arms. \"It's nice.\"\n\nYou snort. \"Thanks?\"\n\n\"Don't let it go to your head,\" she adds, grinning. \"Next thing I know, you'll be dragging me into a store full of pastel crop tops and high heels, and that's where I draw the line.\"\n\nJessica cuts in with a laugh. \"Please. You'd look great in pastel. Own it.\"\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Samantha fires back, making a face. \"I'd rather get tackled by Luke than wear one of those little ruffle things.\"\n\n\"You'd say that until you tried one on.\"\n\n\"Not happening.\"\n\nMaya hands you a little branded bag with your receipt tucked neatly inside. \"These'll look great,\" she says warmly. \"Sometimes small changes do the most.\"\n\nYou nod, your fingers curling around the handle. The bag crinkles softly, light in your hand—but heavier in meaning.\n\nSamantha glances at it like it might combust. \"You realize this is the most feminine bag you've ever carried, right?\"\n\nYou look down at it. \"It's paper.\"\n\n\"Yeah. But it feels like glitter,\" she deadpans. \"You carry that out of here and there's no going back.\"\n\n\"Then I guess I'm committed.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Jessica says smiling. \"Committed is a good look on you.\"\n\nShe throws an arm around your shoulder in exaggerated mock support. \"Godspeed, soldier. May your hair clips be strong and your inner doubt minimal.\"\n\nYou scoff, rolling your eyes, but you don't shrug her off. Her arm's warm and familiar, and for all her dramatic flair, there's a sincerity under it that you don't miss.\n\nJessica glances toward the rest of the store, hands on her hips. \"You know, the clothes here aren't half bad,\" Jessica mentions. \"I've gotten some cute pieces from here before. The quality is decent.\"\n\nSamantha groans dramatically. \"Oh God. Here it comes. The 'let's try on clothes' speech.\"\n\nI didn't say that,\" Jessica says innocently. \"Yet.\"\n\nThe rest of the store suddenly feels like a different planet. The accessories wall was one thing—small, safe, optional. Clothing, though? That's bigger. You feel the weight of the moment press just a little.\n\n\"So,\" Samantha says, drawing the word out. \"Is this the part where you walk out or do we see what fashion crimes await beyond the accessories zone?\" \n\nYou look from the racks to the exit, and the choice sits there, waiting.\n\n[Choice: Go to the clothing section]\n[Choice: Decide to leave the store]",

But your hand tightens around the little shopping bag, fingers curling around the edge. And when you lift your chin, it's with just enough to surprise even yourself.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, voice quiet but clear. \"Sure. I'll take a look.\"\n\n Jessica grins like she just won a bet. \"See? I knew you weren't going to wimp out,\" she says, brushing a strand of her ponytail back. \"You've already gotten halfway through the store, might as well commit to seeing all of it.\"\n\n Samantha lets out a low whistle, dragging her beanie down just a little over her forehead. \"Oh damn,\" she says. \"I was 80% sure you were gonna nope out. Respect.\"\n\n You shrug, but there's a crooked smile on your face that gives you away. \"Guess I'm full of surprises.\"\n\n \"I like this version of you,\" Jessica says, teasing but genuine. \"Brave enough to shop here.\"\n\n Maya reappears from seemingly nowhere, like a stylish fairy godmother who works on commission. She beams, clearly pleased, and gestures with a hanger. \"This way,\" she says, already guiding you deeper into the store.\n\n Samantha falls into step beside you, casting a wary glance around the racks like one of them might try to convert her into a girly girl on the spot. \"If one of these mannequins winks at me, I'm burning this place down,\" she mutters.\n\n \"Relax, Samantha,\" Jessica says, laughing. \"It's a clothing store, not a horror movie.\"\n\n \"Easy for you to say,\" Samantha shoots back, sidestepping a rack of glittery cardigans. \"This is your natural habitat. I'm out here like a raccoon that wandered into a makeup store.\"\n\n \"Not everything has to be combat boots and sarcasm.\"\n\n Samantha shrugs. \"Works for me.\"\n\n Maya leads you into a section lit just a little warmer than the rest, where each piece hangs with a certain amount of dignity. Not crowded, not shoved together—like the clothes are being patient. Like they're waiting for someone to notice them.\n\n \"You see, we don't really do fast fashion,\" Maya explains, pausing to smooth out the hem of a skirt. \"Everything's selected in small batches. If it's here, it's supposed to be here.\"\n\n You nod and scan the selection: a cream apron-style dress that whispers vintage, pleated skirts, blush pink shorts that catch the light, a denim skirt, and more. Each item feels like it's been invited here on purpose.\n\n \"See? This isn't bad,\" Jessica says, looking at the selections. \"You could build some really cute outfits out of this stuff.\"\n\n Samantha squints at the shorts. \"These look like they require a latte and a skincare routine. Not exactly my thing.\"\n\n You snort. \"Thanks for the vote of confidence.\"\n\n \"I'm just saying,\" she says, holding up the pleated skirt with two fingers like it might bite her. \"This stuff's like... fairycore. Do you get what I mean? If you come out in one of these and start talking about moon rituals, I'm leaving you here.\"\n\n \"Moon rituals aren't the worst aesthetic,\" Jessica comments.\n\n \"They are when you have to buy the crystals for them,\" Samantha fires back.\n\n You roll your eyes, but your grip on the bag softens. The banter somehow makes it easier. Safe, even in a place that feels so far from your usual.\n\n At the edge of the section, Maya hooks a few pieces onto a hangar and offers them to you. \"Fitting rooms are just over there,\" she says. \"Take your time.\"\n\n You glance over. The fitting area is cozy, even having a little bench and mirror.\n\n Samantha crosses her arms and leans against a rack of pants, clearly not planning to move. \"Alright,\" she says. \"Moment of truth. Show me your final form.\"\n\n \"What if I come out in a full dress?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n She considers it for a few seconds. \"Depends,\" she says, finally. \"Do you spin dramatically? Because that would definitely earn bonus points.\"\n\n \"Just try them on,\" Jessica says. \"You don't have to spin unless you want to.\"\n\n Maya chuckles as she walks off, giving you space. \"I'll be at the front if you need sizes,\" she calls over her shoulder.\n\n You breathe in and put one foot in front of the other. The door is right there, and now it's all up to you.\n\n \n \n There may be issues with clipping and certain assets not fitting. Please understand!\n \n\n [Choice: Try some stuff on]\n\n \n You take one last glance at the rows of feminine clothing—not harshly, just enough to make it real.\n\n \"Not today,\" you murmur.\n\n \"Bold choice,\" she says, grinning. \"Live to fight another day, huh?\"\n\n \"Aww,\" Jessica says. \"Not going to look at the clothes at all?\"\n\n You offer her a small shrug. \"I don't think I'm ready to.\"\n\n Her expression softens in understanding. \"That's fair.\"\n\n Samantha claps her hands together once, almost like she's breaking a spell. \"Thank God,\" she declares dramatically, spinning toward the exit. \"Because if I had to stand next to another rack of pink cardigans for one more minute, I was gonna spontaneously combust.\"\n\n \"You know, for the record, I still think you'd look good in some of this stuff,\" Jessica says. \"But there's no rush. You do this at your pace.\"\n\n You nod in response.\n\n You, Samantha, and Jessica step out out the store, and the scent of peach and perfume fades into the natural mall air, replaced by the faint whir of escalators and some distant pop remix playing from a speaker. Blink + Shine's pink-and-gold signage stays lit behind you like it's gently judging your life choices.\n\n \"Alright,\" Samantha says, exhaling like she just escaped a hostage situation. \"Blink + Shine: survived, conquered, escaped.\"\n\n Jessica shakes her head, grinning. \"You're impossible.\"\n\n \"I appreciate it,\" Samantha says proudly.\n\n There's a smile tugging at your mouth as the two of you merge back into the steady flow of shoppers. And even though you didn't try on any clothes, you feel like you made the right call.\n\n At least for today.\n\n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

      "text": "<<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You hear the door's soft click as it closes behind you, sealing you into a hushed little world of your own. Inside the dim fitting room, everything feels gentler—like someone paused the noise outside just for this moment.\n\n On the bench lies your selection: a clean white tank top, an oversized soft sweater, and a cute blue skirt. There are a few other pieces still on their hangers—they send a flutter of anticipation through your chest.\n\n You sit down, your hand lingering over the sweater, feeling its weight and texture. It hums with possibility. You begin changing deliberately—the tank top slides on easily, snug but soft. The sweater settles itself just right on your shoulders. You slip into the skirt, and something settles in your chest—a careful calm that feels... correct.\n\n You step toward the mirror and freeze for a moment. It's not unease—it's wonder. The reflection isn't someone else. It's you, clearer and more honest than ever. Like static faded, and a deeper melody emerged.\n\n You do a little spin, enough to let the skirt flutter around your legs, and laugh—light and surprised. Your hands smooth the front, then adjust the folds, then smooth again. Not from doubt, but because you like this feeling. So much that your breath warms and settles in your ribs.\n\n Beautiful.\n\n You realize the word fits you now.\n\n You can't help but smile. Not the nervous, halfway kind you've been doing a lot lately. This one is quiet but whole.\n\n You stay like that for a second longer than necessary. Just... looking.\n\n Then, slowly, you change back.\n\n As you fold the clothes you won't be buying and hang the ones you will back on your arm, your fingers tremble slightly—not with uncertainty, but with something close to joy. You open the door.\n\n Jessica and Samantha are parked by a nearby rack, mid-conversation. Jessica's absently combing through a row of cardigans with one hand, her long blonde ponytail swaying as she turns to make some point. Samantha, on the other hand, is slouched against the wall, arms crossed, wearing the look of someone who's just been enduring a lecture.\n\n \"—I'm just saying that good clothes make you feel different,\" Jessica says. \"You carry yourself differently. Like, confidence isn't just internal. It's also about how things fit and how you see yourself in the mirror.\"\n\n Samantha groans. \"See, this is what happens when you leave me alone with you in a pastel death trap. I get a psych lecture.\"\n\n Jessica rolls her eyes, but it's playful. \"It's not a psych lecture. It's just fashion, Sam.\"\n\n Then they notice you, both set of eyes landing on you at once.\n\n \"Well?\" Jessica says, eyebrows raised. \"How'd it go in there?\"\n\n You can feel it on your face—the stupid little smile you can't quite get rid of. \"Good,\" you say. \"Really good, actually.\"\n\n Jessica brightens instantly, practically clapping her hands together. \"See? I told you this place had its moments. Didn't it feel different? You're still you, but feminine.\"\n\n Samantha squints at you like you've betrayed her. \"Oh no,\" she mutters, backing up a step in genuine horror. \"No. Nooo. I've lost him. He's gone. My best friend—stolen by the dark forces of ruffles and soft lighting.\"\n\n \"Dark forces?\" Jessica repeats. \"This store is literally the definition of bright pastel heaven. It's like walking into a strawberry milkshake. There's nothing dark about it.\"\n\n Samantha groans and slaps a hand over her face. \"Oh, that's even worse! I've been dragged into the lair of the bubblegum overlords. My soul can't survive this much pink.\"\n\n You laugh, actually laugh, and that's enough to make Samantha peek at you between her fingers. \"Oh my God,\" she says slowly, her eyes narrowing like she's studying a strange phenomenon. \"You liked it. You actually liked it in there.\"\n\n You glance down at the clothes in your hands, then back up. \"Yeah,\" you admit, with a little shrug. \"I... did.\"\n\n Jessica grins, triumphant. \"And that's why you trust me. Fashion enlightenment, delivered as promised.\"\n\n \"Guess that's it then,\" Samantha says like she's in pain. \"Guess that's it, then. My best friend's a girlypop now. Gonna start doing filtered selfies next, huh?\"\n\n \"Maybe I will.\"\n\n \"Well, come on then,\" Jessica says. \"Let's make it official before Samantha has a full-blown identity crisis over there.\"\n\n Samantha mutters something about \"buying a coping beanie\" under her breath as she follows, but you're already heading toward the counter.\n\n \n You push the fitting room door closed behind you—it clicks shut, cutting out Blink + Shine's gentle bubblegum pop. Here, under the harsh fitting-room lights, it's just you and the clothes.\n\n You glance down at what you're about to try on, resting neatly on the bench: a white tank top, an oversized sweater, a cute blue skirt—and a few other things that make your heart race. They should be safe and unthreatening. They're just pieces of fabric, after all. But as you pull on the tank top, you feel a familiar tension anchor in your chest—the question: Is this really you?\n\n You catch your reflection as the fabric settles on your shoulder, heart twisting slightly. The clothes fit—shoulder seams sit right, the cut flatters, the fabric flows. You're not hiding in them. But there's still distance between you and the person in the mirror.\n\n You stand straighter, arms folding across your chest like armor. Try your best to mimic confidence. Tilt your chin. Exhale. But every pose feels rehearsed. Distant. And inside, the question still churns: \"What am I even doing?\"\n\n You switch to another skirt. Tug it on, smooth the fabric over your waist and hips, step back. It looks... fine. But still wrong. Wrong enough to make your throat tighten.\n\n There's no panic, no disgust. Just a slow, hollow well of disappointment. You really wanted this to work—and you tried it. But that doesn't make it click.\n\n You strip the clothes off carefully, fold each one back just how they were, neat and patient on the bench. Then you slide into your familiar top. It doesn't feel incredible—it just feels right. Unremarkable, but you. That's enough.\n\n You pull open the door and step out.\n\n Jessica and Samantha are both waiting just outside, talking. Both of them look up the second you step out.\n\n You're back in your regular clothes.\n\n Jessica tilts her head, taking in your expression. \"So...?\" she says gently, eyebrows lifting. \"How'd it go?\"\n\n You hesitate. \"Didn't work,\" you admit finally. \"It just... didn't feel like me.\"\n\n \"Called it,\" Samantha says. \"Those pink shorts were a bad omen from the start.\"\n\n Jessica shoots her a look before turning back to you. \"It's okay, [name]. You don't have to like everything. That's the point of trying things, isn't it? You figure out what feels right and what doesn't.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you mutter. \"Guess I'm just not the kind of person who would shop here.\"\n\n \"Let's just chalk this one up as a test run and move on,\" Jessica says, brushing some dust off her skirt.\n\n Samantha drapes an arm across your shoulders, steering you toward the door with exaggerated care like you've just survived something harrowing. \"C'mon. Let's escape before someone tries to sell you matching pearl earrings. We'll find you something good that doesn't make you feel like you're in girlland.\"\n\n You nod. Neither Jessica or Samantha press. They just walk with you like this was nothing more than a weird little detour.\n\n And honestly? You're grateful for that.\n \n\n[Choice: Time to purchase]",

      "text": "You step into Cuddle Creations, and the rest of the mall might as well not exist anymore.\n\nThe air changes immediately—warmer and softer, like walking into a memory of your childhood bedroom. The lighting is warm and glowy, bouncing off clouds and stars hand-painted on the ceiling in swirling pastel blues and purples. Shelves curve like waves around the store, packed to the brim with plushies: bears, bunnies, bees, dragons, dinosaurs, cats shaped like croissants, sharks with sneakers on, frogs wearing crowns. There's no real order—just magic.\n\nJessica stops in the middle of the store, taking it all in with wide eyes. \"This place is ridiculous,\" she says, voice hushed like she's in a church. \"In the best way, of course.\"\n\n\"You mean aggressively cute,\" Samantha corrects, already wandering toward a display of plush seals with massive, bug-eyed stares. She pokes one in the belly, and it lets out a squeak.\n\nShe recoils dramatically. \"Oh my God. They have sound effects. I hate it. I love it. I'm conflicted.\"\n\nJessica laughs, trailing after her. \"I don't know why you would hate it, that is unreasonably cute. Look at this one—oh my God.\" She picks up a soft pink bunny and hugs it briefly before gently putting it back.\n\nYou drift toward a rack stacked with tiny, palm-sized octopuses, each one reversible with a happy face on one side and an angry one on the other. You flip one inside out, then back again.\n\n\"See?\" Samantha says, snatching it from you and holding it up. \"Me before and after interacting with people.\"\n\n\"That tracks,\" Jessica states, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\"I kind of like it,\" you mutter.\n\n\"Of course you do,\" she says, putting it back gently. \"You would love something that looks like it hasn't known peace since 2003.\"\n\nJessica snorts, covering her mouth to stifle her laugh.\n\nYou keep walking, letting your fingers graze across soft fabric tails and floppy ears. You can't help it—there's something grounding about the sheer quiet joy in the space. No one's rushing. There are kids, sure, but they're sitting on beanbags with giant frogs in their laps. One girl is whispering to what might be a smiling axolotl.\n\nYou pick up a round, blobby plush from the next shelf and squeeze it gently. It gives a faint, comforting squish, like memory foam in stuffed-animal form.\n\n\"They're really soft,\" you murmur.\n\n\"Right?\" Jessica says, smiling. \"It's like they designed them to be impossible to put down.\"\n\n\"If you ask me, it's scientifically engineered emotional warfare,\" Samantha chimes in, now pressing her face into the side of a giant walrus plushie.\n\nYou turn the plush over in your hands, and for a second, the noise of the mall vanishes. The world is quiet. Just you and the shelves of stitched-up comfort.\n\nSamantha nods toward the display.\n\n\"Well? What's the verdict, stuffy connoisseur?\" she teases.\n\nYou glance at her, then back at the plush you're hiding. The truth is, you kind of want to talk about it. Or maybe talk about something else, but in a roundabout way, using this silly little soft thing as a buffer.\n\n[Choice: Ask Samantha what the weirdest stuffed animal she's ever owned is]\n[Choice: Ask Samantha if she would get one of these ironically]\n[Choice: Ask Jessica which plushie would fit her room aesthetic the best]",

I had a whole pile of stuffed animals I'd outgrown, but for some reason, I couldn't let go of them. So, in my brilliant tween brain, I decided I'd... uh... 'upgrade' them.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Upgrade them? What does that even mean?\"\n\n \"This sounds like something you should've been supervised for,\" Jessica says, already suspicious.\n\n Samantha grins, unrepentant. \"It means I grabbed a hot glue gun, some old safety scissors, and went full Dr. Frankenstein. I stitched the head of this really janky bear onto the body of a rainbow giraffe, then glued on the wings of a bat. Oh! I took the tail from a different stuffed animal and stuck it on, too. Instant custom plushie.\"\n\n You just stare at her.\n\n .\n \n \"You glued a bat's wings to a bear-giraffe hybrid.\"\n\n She nods proudly. \"And gave it a tail! Can't forget the tail.\"\n\n Jessica makes a face like she's trying very hard not to imagine it. \"That's... deeply unsettling. Why would you even do that?\"\n\n \"Creative expression, of course,\" Samantha says simply. \"It was art.\"\n\n \"Was it though?\" you ask, not knowing whether to be amused or horrified.\n\n \"Absolutely,\" she says, nodding like this is an irrefutable fact. \"It was the most original thing in my room. I even named it Fuzzles.\"\n\n Jessica blinks. \"You named it?\"\n\n \"Fuzzles,\" Samantha repeats, unbothered. \"I gave him a backstory, too. He was an ancient chimera cursed to live in my closet, but also liked watching cartoons. Very complex character development.\"\n\n You exchange a glance with Jessica, who looks like she's teetering between laughing and calling a therapist on Samantha's behalf.\n\n \"That's certainly one way to cope with growing up,\" Jessica says.\n\n \"You're actually kind of scary,\" you murmur.\n\n Samantha beams, completely unoffended. \"Thank you. Fuzzles would've loved to meet you guys.\"\n\n Jessica shakes her head with a quiet laugh. \"I think Fuzzles should stay in the past where he belongs.\"\n\n \"Agreed,\" you say, nodding solemnly. \"Never speak of Fuzzles again.\"\n\n \"Past? What?\" Samantha asks, blinking. \"No. Fuzzles is still on my bookshelf. Front and center. He guards my manga collection.\"\n\n You stare. \"You still have it?\"\n\n \"Of course I do,\" she says, as if it's the most obvious thing in the world. \"You don't just get rid of Fuzzles. He's part of the household now. My mom dusts him.\"\n\n \"Your mom enables this?\" Jessica asks.\n\n \"She enables greatness,\" Samantha corrects. \"I think you guys are just jealous you don't have a chimera watching over you.\"\n\n \"Or maybe we're just jealous of your ability to sleep in a room with that thing.\"\n\n \"Fuzzles has never hurt anyone,\" Samantha says, narrowing her eyes. \"Yet.\"\n\n Jessica just groans.\n\n \n \"Would you even get one of these?\" you ask Samantha. \"Like... would you ever actually buy a plushie? Or would it have to be ironic for you to justify it?\"\n\n \"Hmm...\" Samantha hums, crossing her arms. \"Probably ironic. I mean, I'm not really a plushie person. They're cute and all, but if I'm dropping money on something, it's gonna be a hoodie, not a plush.\"\n\n Jessica laughs softly. \"So what would make you actually buy one?\"\n\n \"Easy,\" Samantha says, smirking. \"It'd have to be ugly. Like, really ugly.\"\n\n \"Ugly how?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow. \"Like 'not as cute as the others' ugly or 'what ever dream spawned this' ugly?\"\n\n \"Hmm, something like 'grandma accidentally crocheted a nightmare'\" Samantha replies, very serious. \"If it's so ugly that I can't tell if it's a frog, a dog, or a piece of broccoli, then yeah, I'd probably buy it. For the comedy value.\"\n\n Jessica shakes her head, grinning. \"So it has to be... offensively ugly. Not just a little quirky.\"\n\n \"Exactly.\" Samantha gestures toward a shelf of perfectly adorable teddy bears. \"These? Too safe. Too cute. Boring. I want a plushie that looks like it's lived through three wars and maybe a house fire. I want one that makes people stop and ask why anyone would own this. That's worth twenty bucks.\"\n\n Jessica hugs a cinnamon-roll-shaped cat plush closer to her chest like she's protecting it. \"You're unhinged,\" she says, though there's no real bite to it. \"These are supposed to be cute and comforting. Not... nightmare fuel.\"\n\n \"That's what makes it funny,\" Samantha fires back. \"Besides, if it's ugly enough, no one's gonna steal it. Ultimate security plushie.\"\n\n You laugh, shaking your head. \"You know, you say that like you've actually thought this through.\"\n\n \"I have,\" she says, deadpan. \"If I find the ugliest one in the store, I'm buying it. No regrets.\"\n\n Jessica looks at you. \"If she walks out of here with something that looks like roadkill, that's on you for asking.\"\n\n You glance back at Samantha, who's already scanning the shelves with new determination.\n\n And honestly? You're a little scared she's serious.\n\n \n You glance at Jessica. \"Okay,\" you say, grabbing her attention. \"Which one of these would actually fit your room aesthetic? Like, if you had to pick one.\"\n\n Jessica doesn't answer right away. She stands and smooths the front of her top like she's preparing for a very serious question. \"My walls are light yellow,\" she says finally, thoughtfully tapping her chin. \"So... probably a duck. A really cute one. Something small enough to sit on my nightstand or my pillow without looking out of place.\"\n\n You nod. \"Yeah, a duck makes sense. To be honest, you kind of give off 'likes cute ducks' energy.\"\n\n Jessica laughs softly. \"That's the weirdest compliment I've ever gotten, but I'll take it.\"\n\n Samantha perks up immediately. \"Ducks are great,\" she says. \"I like watching them fight over bread at the park.\"\n\n \"You what?\" Jessica asks, her face twisting in mild horror.\n\n \"Not, like, on purpose,\" Samantha clarifies, though she's clearly amused. \"I just feed them and watch nature take its course. May the greatest duck win.\"\n\n Jessica gasps. \"That's mean!\"\n\n You glance between them, trying not to laugh. \"It's also kind of natural selection, though? Like survival of the fittest duck.\"\n\n \"Exactly!\" Samantha points at you like you just validated her entire life philosophy. \"Thank you. It's duck Thunderdome, and I'm just the bread lady.\"\n\n \"You're both terrible,\" Jessica says, hugging a plushie to her chest. \"Ducks are sweet, gentle creatures. They deserve peace.\"\n\n \"They also deserve to work for their carbs,\" Samantha shoots back, smirking. \"Listen, I don't make the rules. I just make sure the bread is evenly distributed.\"\n\n \"That's not how you described it a minute ago,\" you say, laughing. \"You said you like making them fight.\"\n\n \"Details,\" Samantha says with a dismissive wave.\n\n Jessica shakes her head, smiling despite herself. \"I can't believe I'm talking with people who treat ducks like gladiators.\"\n\n \"Hey,\" you chime in, holding up a stuffed duck from a nearby shelf and giving it a gentle squeeze. \"At least this one's safe. No bread battles for this guy.\"\n\n Jessica smiles, reaching over to take the plush from you. \"Exactly. I'll protect you for a few minutes, little duck. Zero duck trauma allowed.\"\n\n \"Lame,\" Samantha comments, a smirk on her face. \"He'd probably lose in the arena anyway.\"\n\n Jessica hugs the duck plush to her chest protectively. \"Over my dead body.\"\n\n You watch them bicker, shaking your head. \"We're in Cuddle Creations, and somehow you two still turned it into a bloodsport debate.\"\n\n \"May the greatest duck win,\" Samantha repeats, deadpan.\n\n Jessica just rolls her eyes and whispers to the duck, \"Don't listen to her.\"\n\n You're starting to think you need popcorn for this.\n \n\n[Choice: Pick a plushie]",

      "text": "You wander a little deeper into the store, the air somehow growing even softer—like every step forward wraps you in a layer of cotton. The lighting feels gentler here, the music more of a hum than a sound, and the only real noise comes from the occasional rustle of tags or the squish of plush against plush.\n\nJessica's eyes sweep over the displays. \"This place is dangerous,\" she says. \"I'm afraid that I'll get attached and end up buying something.\"\n\n\"Dangerous? This store is straight-up evil,\" Samantha mutters. \"I can literally feel my last brain cell turning to mush.\"\n\n\"That implies you had more than one to begin with,\" Jessica quips.\n\nSamantha points at her dramatically. \"That's slander. I'll see you in court.\"\n\nYou laugh under your breath and make your way toward a low shelf near the back. That's where you see it.\n\nA goat plushie.\n\nIt's soft gray, with tiny twisted felt horns and hooves that look like someone stitched them lovingly at 2 in the morning. It's got a dopey, slightly crooked grin, and its little tail sticks out in a way that makes it look like it's mid-chaotic hop.\n\nYou grin without thinking. \"This guy looks like it eats paper when you're not watching.\"\n\nJessica steps up beside you, crouching down to get a closer look. \"Oh my God, you're right. That is absolutely the face of something that just destroyed your homework and is now pretending it didn't.\"\n\n\"Or taxes,\" Samantha adds, crouching on your other side. \"Like you'd walk in on it halfway through your tax returns, and it'd be like, 'Oh, was this important?'\"\n\nYou laugh, holding the goat up between you all. \"And then it'd argue that it was actually helping you by eating them.\"\n\n\"Helping,\" Jessica repeats flatly. \"That's one word for it.\"\n\nYou all stare at it for another second before you gently place it back, like setting down an adorable liability.\n\nJust a few feet away, tucked into a fabric basket and looking like it's trying to stay out of the spotlight, you find a meerkat plushie. Long, lanky, little paws curled up like it's in the middle of panicking over a group project it forgot existed. The furrow in its brow makes it look permanently concerned.\n\nYou run its thumb over its back. \"This one looks like it hasn't slept in three days and thinks it made someone mad in 2016.\"\n\nJessica laughs under her breath. \"I know a few people who are exactly like that.\"\n\nSamantha crosses her arms, squinting down at it. \"That is the face of someone who's rewritten a text seven times and still didn't hit send.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Sounds personal.\"\n\n\"Just observationally accurate.\"\n\nThen, a few steps further on, you spot it—on a nearby table, nestled between two oversized sunflowers made of felt, there's a round, chubby little bee plushie. It's mostly fuzz, with tiny stubby wings that flop when you lift it, a soft yellow belly, and a stitched-on smile that radiates pure, slightly misguided optimism. The wings bounce a little when you shake it gently.\n\n\"Okay,\" you whisper. \"This one's aggressively optimistic.\"\n\nYou turn it upside down. Its stitched face stays smiling.\n\n\"That's the face of someone who apologizes even when they're not at fault,\" Jessica says, tilting her head.\n\n\"This one would accidentally knock over your coffee and then offer you a flower in apology,\" Samantha says.\n\n\"It would offer you someone else's flower and then feel bad about it for a week.\"\n\nThe three of you fall quiet for a moment, the bee in your hands, the goat and meerkat just behind you.\n\nThree choices.\n\nAll dumb. All endearing. All perfect in their own weird, oddly specific ways.\n\nBut you're only getting one.\n\nYou glance sideways at Jessica, who's watching you curiously, then at Samantha, who's already smirking with her arms crossed like she knows exactly how much this decision is wrecking you.\n\n\"So,\" Samantha says. \"Which chaotic creature speaks to your soul, [name].\"\n\nJessica grins. \"No pressure, but this is obviously the most important decision you've ever made.\"\n\nShe's not even wrong.\n\n \n<<if [money] > 19>> \n [Choice: Get the goat plushie]\n [Choice: Get the meerkat plushie]\n [Choice: Get the bee plushie]\n \n[Choice: Decide against getting a plushie]",

      "text": "You hold the bee in your hands a second longer than you mean to.\n\n It's soft in that perfect, squishy way—firm enough to hug back, but yielding like it's already memorized the shape of your arms. Its stitched little eyes are slightly uneven, one antenna bent just a bit more than the other. It looks up at you like it's waiting. Like it knows it might be chosen. Like it's ready to go home with you and never ask why it took this long.\n\n You run your thumb along its plush belly once. Twice. Then set it down.\n\n Carefully.\n\n Like you're apologizing.\n\n Jessica notices the motion first. Her head tilts, her expression softening. \"Oh,\" she says quietly. \"You're... not getting one?\"\n\n \"Nah,\" you say, trying for casual. \"I don't need it.\"\n\n The words fall out heavier than you expect—too final, like the sound of a door closing.\n\n Samantha raises her brows. \"Seriously? After all that dramatic soul-searching back there?\"\n\n \"I wasn't soul-searching.\"\n\n \"Dude.\" Samantha gestures broadly at you. \"You stared at these like they were your long-lost siblings. That was absolutely soul-searching.\"\n\n \"What's stopping you?\" Jessica asks, gentle in a way that makes it clear she isn't teasing.\n\n \"I don't know,\" you say, shrugging. \"I don't need it.\"\n\n \"Sometimes 'want' is enough,\" Jessica states. \"It doesn't have to be practical. it can just make you happy.\"\n\n You ignore her words, yet you end up glancing back once.\n\n The bee is still there—slumped a little to the side, wings folded like it got tired waiting. One of the sunflowers beside it leans just enough to cast a soft shadow across its face. It shouldn't feel like rejection. It shouldn't feel like anything.\n\n But it does.\n\n And it's not just the bee.\n\n You pass the goat again—the one with the off-kilter grin and tiny felt hooves that looked like it belonged in detention for crimes committed against homework and table legs. It was still sitting exactly where you left it. Like it didn't move. Like it didn't hope.\n\n The meerkat, too—long-limbed and nervy, face frozen in that perfect anxiety-ridden panic. It looked like it wanted to whisper something to you. Something quiet. Something like, \"Take me with you. Please. Just me.\"\n\n And you left them all behind.\n\n You look down at your empty hands.\n\n Your chest feels a little too hollow for how crowded the store is.\n\n Samantha moves to your side, arms crossed loosely, but there's no smirk on her face this time. \"You know, you've had to carry a lot lately,\" she says, softer now. \"Like, actual stuff. Emotional junk. Body changes. Existential weirdness. You've been juggling identity like it's part of your class schedule.\"\n\n She nudges your arm lightly. \"You could've let a cute plushie carry one percent of that. Maybe just for tonight.\"\n\n You don't respond.\n\n Because you know she's right. And also because it's already too late. You're already turning, already walking toward the exit. Already letting the soft warm air of Cuddle Creations fall behind you like a missed opportunity.\n\n Your hands are empty, and that hurts.\n \n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]\n\n \n \n \n You cradle the goat plushie in your arms, his stubby little hooves resting against your top like it's making itself at home. He's soft in the way old blankets are soft—slightly worn, warm in places he shouldn't be, and kind of judgmental. His lopsided grin stares up at you with unapologetic smugness. Like he knows he's getting adopted and thinks it's about time.\n\n The felt horns curve unevenly on his head, and one of his ears flops out stubbornly, as if refusing to participate in society. You squeeze it lightly, and something in your chest settles.\n\n It's not even a question. He's coming with you.\n\n \"Oh my God,\" she says, tilting her head at him. \"That goat has a certain energy. How do I describe it...\"\n\n \"He's got strong 'public menace' energy, yeah,\" you say, glancing down at his crooked little face.\n\n \"No, he's worse than that,\" Jessica says, laughing. \"He's got that 'does illegal stuff in public libraries' energy.\"\n\n Samantha steps up beside you, tilting her head at the goat. \"You are absolutely adopting a scam artist, [name].\"\n\n You glance between the two of them and hug the goat a little closer. \"I don't care. He's perfect.\"\n\n \"Perfect?\" Jessica asks, raising a brow. \"He looks like he eats paper for fun.\"\n\n \"Yeah, and then blames you for leaving it out,\" Samantha adds.\n\n You smirk and start heading to the register. \"Sounds like my kind of guy.\"\n \n A store clerk with glittery nails lights up the second they see what you're holding.\n\n You make your way to the counter, goat in tow, and are immediately greeted by a cheerful employee wearing glittery nail polish and a name tag that reads Jenn.\n\n \"Oh my God!\" Jenn exclaims, lighting up the moment she sees your choice. \"You picked Grumble Goat! That one's part of our limited run. We call him Grumble because he always looks like he's about to cancel a company meeting with zero notice.\"\n\n You look down at the goat's perma-frown and nod. \"Yeah. That tracks.\"\n\n Jenn begins scanning the tag, then gestures toward a pastel kiosk nearby. \"And now you get to do the best part—name him! It prints out a little adoption certificate. Official and everything.\"\n\n You blink at the screen. \"You're serious?\"\n\n \"Oh yeah,\" Jenn says brightly. \"Once it's printed, it's canon.\"\n\n \"I hope you're ready for this level of responsibility,\" Samantha mutters from beside you. \"You're basically becoming a single parent.\"\n\n \"I'm not naming him Steve,\" you warn.\n\n Jessica snickers. \"You absolutely can't name him Steve. Look at his face. He needs something dramatic.\"\n\n \"Yeah, he does,\" Samantha says. She taps her chin, mock thoughtful. \"Hmm. Baron Von Paperchewer. Or maybe... Sir Misbehaves-a-Lot.\"\n\n You stare.\n\n \"What?\" she says. \"You brought this upon yourself.\"\n\n Jessica grins and gestures at the kiosk. \"Go on, [name]. Give him a name worthy of all this chaos.\"\n\n You look back at the goat. His dumb, perfect face dares you to commit. To make it official.\n\n You reach for the keyboard.\n\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n \n \n You hold the little meerkat plushie in your hands, its paws curled nervously to its chest, stitched eyes wide like it's constantly apologizing for something it didn't even do. It's the kind of expression that says \"I'm just happy to be here, but also deeply stressed about it.\" Something in you softens. You don't know why, but you feel like you get this thing. Or maybe, it gets you.\n\n Jessica steps up beside you with a curious hum. \"Oh, wow,\" she says, leaning down to get a closer look. \"That one's... kind of adorable, actually. Like he just apologized for bumping into you.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, huffing a laugh. \"He definitely has that kind of energy where he feels sorry just for existing.\"\n \n Samantha drifts up beside you, peering at the meerkat like she's sizing it up for crimes.\n\n \"Oh no,\" she says flatly. \"That little guy's definitely been emotionally devastated by having to talk to others.\"\n\n You smirk. \"He looks like he triple-checks his text messages before sending 'k.'\"\n\n Jessica snickers. \"Honestly? He does.\"\n\n Samantha nods solemnly. \"He's in a permanent state of rehearsing fake conversations for real interactions.\"\n\n \"He'd panic over picking a snack and then just get the same one he always does,\" you say, cradling the plushie a little closer.\n\n \"That's depressingly accurate,\" she says, and then adds, \"I like him.\"\n\n \"You like him because he's neurotic.\"\n\n \"No,\" Samantha says, leaning in to boop the meerkat's nose. \"I like him because he's neurotic and loyal.\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head thoughtfully. \"Okay, but that's kind of sweet. Like he's anxious, sure, but he's trying his best. There's something really lovable about that.\"\n\n Her words stick with you for a second, and you hug the meerkat a little tighter. Somehow, he feels less like a random plush and more like a small reflection of a part of you.\n\n You carry him gently to the front counter. The cashier spots you and lights up immediately.\n\n \"Ooh, someone picked a PeekPal!\" she says, grinning wide. Her name tag—Jenn—glitters under the warm lights.\n\n \"A Peek-what?\" you ask.\n\n Jenn turns the meerkat slightly, revealing a small woven tag near its hind leg: PeekPal Series — For The Quiet Kind of Brave.\n\n \"They're part of a new line,\" Jenn explains as she scans the barcode. \"Designed for people who overthink everything but still show up for the people they care about.\"\n\n You blink down at the meerkat. You think of the way he seemed to hide behind the other plushies, how his brow was slightly furrowed in stitched worry, how he felt just right when you picked him up. That familiar kind of anxious hopefulness you yourself have felt too many times before.\n\n \"He looks like he's emotionally exhausted but refuses to go to bed,\" Samantha mutters beside you.\n\n Jenn giggles. \"Exactly! He's from the 'Cautious but Courageous' set.\" She gestures to a glowing kiosk off to the side. \"Anyway, you can make it official over there. Comes with a certificate and everything. You're basically adopting a tiny plushie full of anxiety and love.\"\n\n You cradle the meerkat a little tighter. His fur's soft against your fingertips, and somehow, just being in your arms makes him seem a little less on edge.\n\n Samantha watches you for a second, then says, \"Just make sure you pick a name that won't give him a full identity crisis, okay?\"\n\n \"No promises,\" you murmur.\n\n The kiosk pulses gently, the screen lit in soft pastels. Name Your PeekPal flashes across the top.\n \n \"He kind of looks like a Maurice to me,\" Jessica mutters, inspecting your meerkat carefully. \"Or maybe a Benedict. Something proper and unnecessarily anxious.\"\n\n You take one last glance down at your new nervous friend, who stares back with that same uncertain but hopeful gaze.\n\n You don't answer.\n\n You just smile and start typing.\n\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n \n \n The bee plushie's still where you left it—perched between two felt sunflowers like it's posing for a yearbook photo it didn't know would be permanent. Its fuzzy yellow belly practically glows under the warm lighting, stubby little legs poking out like it's bracing for impact. The soft felt wings wobble as you pick it up again, and its stitched-on smile somehow manages to look both enthusiastic and deeply uncertain.\n\n You don't even hesitate. You reach for him like it's already yours.\n\n Something about it just clicks. He's not the biggest, or the fluffiest, or even the most detailed. But he fits perfectly into your hands. Just firm enough to squish without losing shape. Just fuzzy enough to comfort without clinging. You press his little belly and imagine him sitting on your shelf, cheering you on in his tiny, high-pitched bee voice every time you sit down to work or panic about life.\n\n Jessica steps up beside you, leaning over slightly to get a good look at him. \"Aww, he's cute,\" she says, her tone softer than usual. \"Kind of like one of those relentlessly positive friends.\"\n\n Samantha snorts, folding her arms as she stares down at him. \"No. That thing has the face of a bee who's been in a team-building seminar for five minutes and already deeply regrets all his life choices.\"\n\n You laugh. \"I mean... yeah. But he'd still hand out the icebreaker cards.\"\n\n She flicks one of the bee's felt wings gently. \"He's definitely the guy who says, 'I think we're all doing great!' while dying inside.\"\n\n Jessica laughs. \"That's kind of adorable, though. Like he's struggling but still trying to make everyone else feel better. He's basically a mascot for emotional resilience.\"\n\n \"He's doing his best,\" you say, holding him closer.\n\n \"Which makes two of you,\" Samantha says, grinning.\n\n Jessica tilts her head. \"Honestly? He kind of suits you. He's got that look where it seems like he's trying so hard even when it's hard to try.\" \n \n You gently squeeze the bee one more time, and there's something satisfying about how he bounces back—like he's always going to try, even when he's overwhelmed. Maybe especially then.\n\n At the counter, Jenn—a bright-eyed employee with a glittery name tag—lights up the moment she sees what you're holding.\n\n \"Ohh! BuzzBuddy alert!\" she exclaims. \"I love those guys.\"\n\n You blink. \"That's a real category?\"\n\n \"Yep! Part of our Support Squad line,\" Jenn says, already reaching for the scanner. \"BuzzBuddies are for folks who try real hard, spiral a little, and still show up anyway.\"\n\n Samantha leans in and nods like she's judging a wine. \"A bold choice. Strong notes of people-pleasing and barely contained anxiety.\"\n\n Jenn finishes scanning the tag and then gestures toward the kiosk. \"Alright! Time for the best part—his name. Gotta make it official.\"\n\n The screen glows a soft honey yellow, little sparkles drifting behind the blinking cursor. The prompt reads: Name Your BuzzBuddy.\n\n You walk over, cradling the bee in your arm. He stares up at the screen with his stitched-on smile like he's about to encourage you to do your best.\n\n Samantha peeks over your shoulder. \"What if you named him something absurd?\"\n\n You snort. \"I think he deserves better than that.\"\n\n \"Oh, I agree,\" she says, nudging you lightly with her elbow. \"But you know he'd answer to literally anything if you said it with confidence.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but the smile on your face won't go away.\n\n Jessica nudges your arm lightly. \"Make it something fitting. He looks like the kind of bee who really needs a good name.\"\n\n Your fingers hover over the screen.\n\n He's waiting.\n\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]",

You take a breath, then start typing.\n\n The name lights up on the screen: [goatplushieName].\n\n A chime dings, and animated goat confetti bursts across the display—little cartoon hooves and horns in exaggerated majesty. You crack a smile, a real one. It's ridiculous. But also kind of perfect.\n\n \"[goatplushieName],\" Jessica repeats, drawing it out like she's testing the weight of it. Then she nods. \"Okay. I can respect that. Feels... regal. Like he should come with his own crown.\"\n\n \"Regal?\" Samantha scoffs, arms crossed. \"No, no no. This goat isn't regal. This goat is absolutely a middle manager who steals pens and lies about his time sheets. Look at that face.\"\n\n You glance back at her. \"[goatplushieName] has gravitas.\"\n\n \"He has a rap sheet,\" Samantha shoots back.\n\n Before you can respond, Jenn leans forward with theatrical flair. \"[goatplushieName]! Lovely choice. Mischievous. Mysterious. A little chaotic. We love to see it.\"\n\n She hits a few buttons, and the screen spins around to face you again. On it, in a playful font:\n\n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, [goatplushieName]!\n\n A digital badge appears beneath it that says \"Certified Goofball.\"\n\n You snort.\n\n \"Yeah. That tracks,\" Jessica says, laughing softly. \"He's definitely a goofy little guy.\"\n\n \"Can I get one of those for you, [name]?\" Samantha asks. \"Put Certified Goofball right on your student ID.\"\n\n Jenn gestures toward a soft pastel podium with a build-in printer, and a gentle hum begins. A small certificate emerges from the slot, printed on cream-colored cardstock with a faint shimmer.\n\n Jenn presents it like its sacred. \"One official Certificate of Adoption.\"\n\n You take it carefully and read:\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that [goatplushieName], a Goat of Great Personality and Questionable Impulse Control, has been lovingly adopted by [name] on this day. May your hugs be strong, your snacks be shared, and your secrets be safe.\n\n Samantha reads over your shoulder. \"Wow. I didn't know the goat came with a legal document binding you to emotional intimacy.\"\n\n You gently slip the certificate into the tote Jenn hands over—white canvas with a little sleeping moon curled around a teddy bear stitched on the front.\n\n Jenn carefully tucks [goatplushieName] in with soft tissue, making sure his horns don't get squished. \"Take good care of him,\" she says, lowering her voice a little like it's a secret. \"He's one of our favorite troublemakers.\"\n\n \"Don't worry about that,\" you say, hugging the bag to your chest. \"I'll take the very best care of him.\"\n\n \"Congrats,\" Jessica says warmly as the three of you head toward the exit. \"He's gonna be a bold addition to your life.\"\n\n You glance down at the tote, [goatplushieName]'s crooked grin peeking through the folds.\n\n And as the three of you walk back into the heart of the mall, you feel it—light, stupid, warm—like you really did just make space for something that matters.\n\n Even if it's just a very questionable goat.\n\n \n You take a breath. Not because it's hard—but because something about this feels... permanent. Or at least important in a way you don't want to mess up.\n\n Your fingers hover over the pastel keyboard. You type the letters one by one.\n\n [meerkatplushieName].\n\n The kiosk dings like it's proud of you. Yellowish confetti bursts across the screen with cartoon flair, and a nervous little animated meerkat peeks out from behind a digital cactus, blinking up at you like he's just now realizing he exists.\n\n \"Oh my God,\" Jessica says, a laugh slipping out before she can stop it. \"That's actually... perfect. He does look like a [meerkatplushieName].\"\n\n Samantha groans, but the smirk on her face betrays her. \"Ugh, that's so disgustingly wholesome it's giving me cavities. I was hoping for something like... I don't know. Chaos incarnate. But fine, [meerkatplushieName] works.\"\n\n Jenn leans in dramatically. \"[meerkatplushieName],\" she whispers like it's a secret spell. \"That name fits. Not that I'm allowed to say anything legally binding, but—he looks like he journals.\"\n\n You glance down at the plushie in your hands. His soft little body presses into your chest like he's trying to be smaller than it is. You smile before you even know you're doing it.\n\n Jenn taps a few more keys and spins the screen around.\n\n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, [meerkatplushieName]!\n\n A digital badge appears beneath it that says \"Overthinker, Hug Magnet, Snack Enthusiast.\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head, reading it aloud. \"Snack enthusiast? Yeah, that tracks. He definitely looks like the kind of guy who stress-eats cookies at 2 in the morning.\"\n\n Samantha snorts. \"You're right. He'd be eating saltines out of the box.\"\n\n Jenn gestures to a small podium where a soft hum is already whirring from the printer. \"Let's make it official.\"\n\n A certificate slides out on cream-colored paper, slightly textured and—somehow—scented faintly like vanilla frosting. Jenn lifts it reverently, holding it out like it's a diploma.\n\n You take it gently.\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that [meerkatplushieName], a proud member of the PeekPal Series, has been lovingly adopted by [name] on this day. Though he lives in constant fear of loud noises and minor inconveniences, he will show up, be brave, and offer his tiny paws anyway. Provide snacks often. Encouragement always.\n\n You try not to laugh. But something about it makes your chest warm. It's like this moment knows exactly what it's doing.\n\n \"That's actually so sweet,\" Jessica says, smiling as she reads. \"Kind of feels like a pep talk for the both of you.\"\n\n Samantha leans over your shoulder, reading aloud in a whisper, \"Offer his tiny paws anyway...\" Then she pauses and grins. \"This little guy's going to destroy you emotionally, isn't he?\"\n\n Jenn wraps the meerkat in soft yellow tissue, careful not to bend the ears. She seals it with a round sticker that reads: \"He's safe now.\" Then she tucks him into a tote bag printed with the Cuddle Creations logo—an adorable bear sleeping inside a crescent moon.\n\n As she hands the bag over, Jenn smiles and leans in slightly. \"He's the kind that needs a lot of reassurance. But something tells me you've got that covered.\"\n\n Samantha grabs the handles before you can, then lifts the bag between you like she's weighing it. \"This thing's radiating codependent energy. You two are gonna get along great.\"\n\n You carefully slide the certificate into the tote, smoothing the corners so it doesn't crumple.\n\n Then the three of you step out of the store—back into the mall's warm lights and distant chatter. Samantha glances sideways at you as you walk.\n\n \"[meerkatplushieName]?\" she says, in mock disbelief. \"Really?\"\n\n You nod once, still smiling.\n\n \"Eh. I guess it fits,\" Samantha says, shrugging. \"Well, I guess congratulations are in order. You're not a proud parent to a stress ball with eyes.\"\n\n And with that, the two of you melt into the flow of the crowd, a plushie tucked under your arm and something softer settling in your chest.\n\n \n You take a breath and rest your fingers on the screen, just for a second, letting the moment sit. Then you start to type: [beeplushieName].\n\n The kiosk responds with a cheerful ding, and suddenly the display bursts to life. Animated bees zip across the screen in loops, tiny sparkles trailing behind them. One smacks into a cartoon daisy and does a slow-motion spin before wobbling upright again. It's all so charmingly over-the-top that you can't help but smile.\n\n Jenn lets out a delighted gasp. \"[beeplushieName]! Ugh, that is so sweet I think I just got a cavity,\" she says, practically bouncing on her heels.\n\n Samantha, peeking over your shoulder, rolls her eyes but doesn't bother hiding her grin. \"I mean, it's something,\" she teases.\n\n \"It's a good name,\" Jessica says. She leans down and whispers to your plushie. \"You have a good name. Don't let Samantha tell you otherwise.\"\n\n You glance down at the bee, still nestled in the crook of your arm. He looks completely unbothered. Loyal. Cheerful. Probably humming a motivational jingle in his head.\n\n Jenn gives a few final taps, and then swivels the screen around dramatically.\n\n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, [beeplushieName]!\n\n A digital badge appears underneath: \"Certified Encouragement Specialist – Level 1 Buzz\"\n\n Samantha leans in. \"Level one? Wow. So humble. He's just here to buzz supportively while the world burns.\"\n\n You snort, clutching the plushie a little closer.\n\n Jenn beams. \"Okay, time to make it official!\"\n\n She leads the two of you over to a curved little podium where a soft whirring starts. The printer behind it buzzes quietly, then gently slides out a creamy slip of thick, textured paper with gold lettering and a delicate floral trim.\n\n Jessica picks it up before you can, holding it delicately like it's fragile.\n\n \"Wow,\" she says, eyes scanning it before handing it to you. \"It's like... actually official.\"\n\n You read it over:\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that [beeplushieName], proud member of the BuzzBuddy Support Squad, has been lovingly adopted by [name] on this day. Though he is often overwhelmed and mildly vibrating with panic, he will always try his best, encourage those around him, and commit to emotional support with great enthusiasm. Buzz responsibly.\n\n You stare at it for a second longer than expected. There's something about it that lands differently. Something warm and ridiculous and a little bit real.\n\n Samantha peers over your arm. \"Okay, it's rude how that actually got to me. Why is a fake bee giving me emotions?\"\n\n Jenn is already wrapping the plushie in soft yellow tissue paper dotted with little white daisies. She nestles him gently into a sky-blue Cuddle Creations tote bag, its front stamped with a sleepy moon curled around a bear.\n\n She nudges the bag forward with a wink. \"Take good care of him. He's got a lot of feelings and no idea where to put them.\"\n\n Samantha folds her arms, watching you slip the certificate into the tote. \"So, like you, then.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"He's way more optimistic than I am.\"\n\n \"You know what?\" she says. \"That's true.\"\n\n Jessica chuckles. \"I like this bee. It feels like you.\"\n\n \"It just felt right,\" you say, shrugging lightly.\n\n And together, you walk out, the buzz of the mall wrapping around you again—[beeplushieName] safely tucked under your arm, like he was always meant to be there.\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

      "text": "The moment the words \"NovaTrend first\" leave your mouth, Jessica lights up like it's Christmas morning.\n\n \"Yes! I knew you had it in you, [name]!\" she cheers, grabbing your arm and giving it a little shake, practically glowing. \"This is going to be so good for you. We are gonna get you looking polished.\"\n\n Samantha, meanwhile, gasps like you just betrayed her. \"Damn. And here I was thinking we were best friends,\" she says, clutching her chest. \"Guess I was just the warm-up act for Queen Jessica and her Palace of Beige.\"\n\n Jessica gives her a playful side-eye. \"It's not beige. It's chic.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" Samantha says flatly, \"chic if your personality is an almond milk latte.\"\n\n Jessica rolls her eyes but grins. \"Samantha just can't comprehend subtlety.\"\n\n \"Subtlety? Jessica, this place is basically Pinterest for rich people,\" Samantha fires back, following a step behind like she's making sure you don't fully defect to the other side. \"They probably iron their receipts.\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head, unbothered. \"And yet, you're still coming in.\"\n\n \"I gotta supervise,\" Samantha mutters. \"Make sure they don't slap a cardigan on him and brainwash him into talking about 'capsule wardrobes.'\"\n\n Jessica smirks. \"Don't knock capsule wardrobes until you try them.\"\n\n \"Are you two gonna argue the whole way there?\" you ask, sighing.\n\n \"Yes,\" they both say in unison, and somehow that feels about right.\n\n \n Leaving Threadz behind, the air almost feels different—brighter, calmer, less like you've just walked out of a mosh pit. The buzz of the mall hums around you as you head toward NovaTrend.\n\n Jessica stretches her arms a little, looking visibly relieved. \"Finally. Stepping out of hell and into heaven,\" she says as her eyes lock onto the sleek storefront ahead.\n\n \"Hell is cool, dude,\" Samantha fires back, snorting. \"At least it's got personality.\"\n\n Jessica side-eyes her but doesn't bother arguing, too focused on her prize. \"Personality doesn't make up for bad lighting and a shirt wall that gave me a headache.\"\n\n \"That's your problem,\" Samantha says, just shrugging. \"Some of us like a little chaos.\"\n\n \"So this one's the classy part of the field trip, then?\" you ask.\n\n \"Exactly,\" Jessica says, smiling. \"Prepare to see how real clothes are supposed to look.\"\n\n \"Or prepare to get bored out of your mind, Samantha mutters, though she follows anyway.\n\n The signage for NovaTrend grows larger as you approach, all clean lines and subtle branding, until the entrance looms in front of you.\n\n Jessica pushes her hair like she's about to walk a runway. \"Alright. Let's fix you up.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n\nNovaTrend feels like it stepped out of a magazine the moment you approach—pristine glass, sleek black trim, mannequins in effortless poses, and a gentle hint of clean linen and fruit drifting out whenever the door opens. It's stylish without being showy, like trendy doesn't need to shout.\n\nThe second you step into NovaTrend, it feels like you've crossed some invisible threshold from the messy, fluorescent mall chaos into the curated, ultra-clean world of a fashion influencer's closet.\n\nJessica actually sighs as you walk in, like she's home. \"See? This is how a store should feel.\"\n\nSamantha lags behind, her beat-up sneakers squeaking slightly against the polished tile as she folds her arms. \"Yeah, if what you're going for is sterile and mildly terrifying,\" she mutters, eyeing a display of perfectly folded cardigans like they've personally offended her.\n\n\"Don't be dramatic,\" Jessica says, clearly unimpressed. \"It's clean. Organized. Everything here has a place and a purpose. That's called intentional design, Samantha.\"\n\nSamantha snorts. \"Intentional design, sure. Or maybe it's a place where fun comes to die.\" She stops at a pair of mannequins posed mid-laugh, one hand cocked on a fake hip, the other gesturing at nothing. \"Dude, even these guys. Look at them. They look like they've benefitted from nepotism.\"\n\n\"Or maybe they have their lives together,\" Jessica fires back smoothly.\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, glancing between them. \"Do I need to separate you two before this turns into an actual fight?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not fighting,\" Jessica states, smirking. \"I'm just enlightening her.\"\n\n\"Please,\" Samantha groans, throwing her head back. \"There's nothing enlightening about this place.\"\n\nYou can't help but laugh under your breath as Jessica turns her attention back to the store, gesturing around like she's conducting a tour. \"This is exactly what you need, [name]. Clothes that don't scream, but still say something. Pieces that make you look like you put in effort, even when you didn't.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Samantha chimes in, \"if what you want them to say is, 'Hi, I'm [name], and I own a curated bookshelf of books I haven't read.\"\n\n\"Better than, 'Hi, I'm [name], and I haven't bought new clothes since middle school,'\" Jessica shoots back.\n\nYou hold up your hands. \"Wow. Okay. Didn't realize I was opening myself up for roast night.\"\n\nJessica softens immediately, her playful edge melting into something gentler as she steps closer. \"Relax. I'm only teasing. Really, though—you don't need to overthink this. Just find something you like. Whatever feels like you, but maybe a little more put together.\"\n\nSamantha doesn't argue, instead drifting to a display of boots she has no intention of endorsing. \"Fine. But if you walk out of here looking super basic, I reserve the right to mock you forever.\"\n\n\"Noted,\" you say dryly.\n\nJessica grins and gently nudges you toward a rack of soft knits. \"Just see what catches your eye. No pressure.\"\n\nYou wander off on your own. But before you can really explore, a staff member approaches. They have an effortless bounce that suggests they've worn every piece in the store twice already. Their name tag reads \"Elle (they/them)\" and they catch the hesitation in your body language instantly. \"Hey there! Welcome to NovaTrend. First time shopping here?\"\n\nYou hesitate. \"Is it that obvious?\"\n\n\"Only because you're standing like the clothes are dangerous,\" Elle says, chuckling softly. \"No worries, though. Looking for anything particular today? Something casual? Or just trying things out.\"\n\nYou nod. \"Just... trying stuff. New to this.\"\n\nElle nods like they've heard it before. \"Got it. Let's keep it easy. We've got some really comfortable, low-fuss pieces that still look put together. Want me to pull a few options in your size?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" you say, nodding.\n\nElle gives you a quick once-over, and glides off to a nearby rack. They return a minute later with a small stack of clothes—nothing outrageous, just trendy pieces that seem to beckon.\n\n\"These are pretty forgiving fits,\" Elle says. \"Nothing that hugs too hard, and everything's adjustable. If you like how any of them feel, we can look at other options too.\"\n\nYou nod again. \"Thanks.\"\n\nElle gestures toward the back. \"Fitting rooms are just through there. Let me know if you need another size.\"\n\nYou head in the direction they pointed, passing displays of wide-leg trousers, trendy boots, and two mannequins posed mid-laugh, like they just heard a joke only rich people understand.\n\nBehind you, Samantha mutters, \"One of those mannequins just judged me.\"\n\n\"That's because you came in looking like Threadz threw up on you,\" Jessica says, rolling her eyes.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Samantha replies sweetly.\n\nYou roll your eyes and make your way to the fitting rooms. There, you find a calm, welcoming space: soft lights, a mirror framed gently, and a wooden bench. You hold the chosen outfits like quiet treasures.\n\nYou step inside the changing room, closing the curtain behind you. The world softens to just you, the clothes, and a mirror.\n\n[Choice: Try outfits on]",

      "text": "<<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You take your time in the fitting room.\n\n Piece by piece, you try each item on—the cream top, the skirt, even the fancy black dress. They settle onto your frame like they were waiting. There's no awkward tugging or uncomfortable shifting. Just warmth. Just you.\n\n The skirt swishes around your legs with a light, playful motion every time you move, and the top rests gently against your chest. You do a little turn in the mirror. You don't even flinch. Instead, you smile.\n\n You like what you see.\n\n There's a quiet thrill in how natural it feels. How your shoulders relax, how your posture changes without even thinking. This isn't pretending. It's discovering.\n\n You slip back into the clothes you wore in after, slower than usual, carefully folding each item as you place it back onto the hook. Your hand lingers on the black slit skirt. You hesitate.\n\n You glance at your reflection one last time, and your heart answers before your brain catches up.\n\n I want this.\n\n You step out, cheeks warming as the soft store music greets you again.\n\n Samantha's leaning against a display table, flipping through a rack of trendy tops and looking disgusted. The second she sees you, her eyes scan your face.\n\n She blinks. Then grins.\n\n \"Well, damn,\" she says, straightening. \"Someone had a good time in there.\"\n\n Jessica, standing nearby with her arms loosely crossed, beams like she's been waiting for this moment. \"That's the magic of NovaTrend,\" she says simply.\n\n \"...Yeah,\" you admit. \"I think I actually like this.\"\n\n Jessica laughs softly. \"Told you. All it takes is the right place and the right clothes.\"\n\n You glance back at the mirror in the fitting room one last time. And for once, you don't look away.\n\n \n The clothes fit. Technically.\n\n The sleeves aren't too tight, the skirt falls just right, and the soft tops don't cling in a weird way. You look... fine. Objectively speaking, maybe even kind of good. You can imagine someone else wearing them and pulling it off without blinking.\n\n But as you stare at yourself in the mirror, you feel a weird kind of distance building between you and your reflection.\n\n You tug on the collar on the cream top. Adjust the waistband of the skirt. Do a half-turn.\n\n It's not bad, but it doesn't feel like you.\n\n You want it to. You try. You picture how this would look in public. Maybe if your posture was different or if your head was clearer. You sigh, pressing your palms against the sides of your thighs. You're not disgusted, not upset. Just... disconnected. Like this is someone else's closet and you're just borrowing their role.\n\n You change back, fold the pieces, and pick them up. You hesitate for a second, then pull open the curtain.\n \n The light spills back in. The world resumes.\n\n Jessica is waiting, arms crossed but expectant, while Samantha is half-sitting on a low display table, pretending to be unimpressed but clearly curious.\n\n Jessica straightens immediately, her bright, supportive smile faltering. \"[name]?\" she says gently, her tone careful.\n\n \"Yeah, no,\" Samantha says. \"That's your 'I hate every second of this' face.\"\n\n \"It just wasn't me,\" you admit, the words coming out heavier than you expected. \"I don't know. I thought maybe it'd click, but it just... doesn't. It feels like I'm pretending.\"\n\n \"Then it's not right,\" Jessica states, frowning. \"You're not supposed to force it.\"\n\n Samantha nods, softer than you expect. \"Yeah. If it doesn't feel like you, it's not you. No point in trying to fit into someone else's vibe.\"\n\n You nod, relieved but a little disappointed at the same time. Maybe you thought you'd walk out transformed, but instead, you just feel like a kid in borrowed clothes.\n \n\n[Choice: Is there anything to buy?]",

You're back in your usual clothes, empty-handed.\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n Jessica keeps pace at your side, looking at you like you've grown a second head. \"Wait. You're really not getting anything?\" she asks, bewildered. \"You liked those outfits. I saw your face. You had a moment in there.\"\n\n You scratch the back of your neck, feeling oddly exposed under her incredulous stare. \"I did. I don't know. They were nice. Really nice.\" You hesitate. \"But... it's expensive. Like, really expensive. I couldn't make myself do it.\"\n\n Jessica groans softly, like she can't believe you just walked away from self-actualization over a price tag. \"[name], that's what quality costs! You felt good in those clothes. That's kind of the point.\"\n\n \"Yeah, well,\" Samantha cuts in from your other side, lacing her hands behind her head with a smug grin, \"good news: Threadz costs half as much and comes with the added bonus of making you look like you might start a garage band. You know. Real value.\"\n\n Jessica shoots her a look. \"Oh yes, truly timeless.\"\n\n Samantha grins wider. \"Better than spending a week's allowance on a sweater.\"\n\n You can't help but laugh under your breath, their back-and-forth tugging you out of your head. \"Maybe next time,\" you say, though you're not sure who you're trying to convince—Jessica or yourself.\n\n Even though you're walking away with nothing, part of you still feels lighter than when you walked in.\n \n \n \"Didn't feel right, huh?\" Samantha comments.\n\n You shake your head. \"No. It really wasn't me.\"\n\n Jessica falls into step beside you, her voice soft and easy. \"That's okay. You don't have to force it. Clothes are supposed to feel like you, not someone else.\"\n\n \"Exactly,\" Samantha chimes in. \"And honestly? That's half of what this whole thing is. Trying stuff, deciding what doesn't work, moving on. It's not a fail, it's just part of the process.\"\n\n You glance at them, surprised by how simply they say it, like this doesn't have to be a big deal. Like it's fine to just walk away.\n\n \"Thanks,\" you say.\n \n\n \n The doors of NovaTrend slide shut behind you with a soft hiss and a final puff of floral-scented air. The mall greets you again with its usual overstimulating hum—brighter lights, louder voices, someone arguing on speakerphone near the store next door.\n\n You've got the shopping bag in your hand. Just one—light, matte white, with the NovaTrend logo printed in metallic foil. It rustles faintly as you walk, even though it barely weighs anything.\n\n Jessica claps her hands together like she just won a bet. \"See? I told you. NovaTrend is the best,\" she says, practically bouncing as she grabs your free arm. \"Look at you, [name]. You're glowing. This is growth.\"\n\n \"I don't think buying one thing makes me 'glowing.'\"\n\n \"Unbelievable. I can't believe you fell to the dark side,\" Samantha says. \"One trip in with Jessica and suddenly [name]'s out here buying eighty dollar pants that come with free pretension.\"\n\n \"They weren't that expensive,\" you say quickly, then pause. \"At least, I don't think they were.\"\n\n \"See? You don't even know how much you spent,\" Samantha says, pointing at you like she just uncovered evidence in a court case. \"That's how the cult gets you. First it's one nice top, next thing you know you're drinking iced matchas and talking about how 'minimalism changed your life.'\"\n\n You roll your eyes. \"It's literally just clothes. And I liked how it felt.\"\n\n Jessica gives Samantha the smuggest look possible. \"Exactly. [name] liked it. That's called having taste.\"\n\n \"Or being brainwashed by clean lines and neutral tones,\" Samantha mutters, crossing her arms.\n\n You glance between them, exasperated but trying not to laugh. \"If this is what happens every time I buy clothes, maybe I should've just stayed in cargo shorts forever.\"\n\n Jessica gasps in horror. \"Don't you dare even joke about that. We've come too far.\"\n\n \"Fine,\" Samantha says, sighing heavily. \"But we've got to go to Threadz to cleanse your soul. You need something chaotic to balance out whatever polished nonsense you just bought.\"\n\n \"Or we could keep the momentum going and actually get [name] a wardrobe that doesn't scream 'I don't own a mirror.'\"\n\n \"Threadz has mirrors,\" Samantha fires back.\n\n \"Yeah, the kind covered in stickers,\" Jessica says sweetly.\n\n You groan, already regretting every life choice that led to this. \"Can we just move on before you two kill each other?\"\n\n Samantha shrugs. \"Fine. But I'm still going to do something about your fashion later.\"\n\n Jessica grins, clearly enjoying every second. \"And I'll be here to undo it.\"\n\n You shake your head, staring down at the bag in your hand. It's a small thing, but somehow, it feels like more than that.\n \n Maybe this is growth.\n \n\n \n [Choice: Now go to Threadz]\n\n \n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

      "text": "Stepping into ShatterBox, you're hit with a wave of velvet darkness and electric energy—like a haunted mansion redesigned for alt fashion devotees. The walls are matte black, purple LED strips twisting around shelves like digital ivy, and the speakers pulse with slow, thudding bass. Posters featuring cult indie bands, surreal album art, and glitch-horror illustrations cling at odd angles, while mannequins stand in brooding poses—as if daring you to challenge them.\n\nJessica glances around with a mixture of curiosity and judgment. \"This is an interesting aesthetic,\" she says slowly, drawing out the words like she's still making up her mind.\n\n\"Oh yeah,\" Samantha says, grinning. \"This is my kind of place. Not as much as Threadz, but still alright. Smells like rebellion and secondhand eyeliner.\"\n\n\"Secondhand eyeliner?\" you ask. \"Does that exist?\"\n\n\"You clearly haven't seen enough in life, my dear [name],\" Samantha says. \"I don't even know who originally bought my favorite eyeliner.\"\n\nYou frown.\n\nJessica trails a few steps behind you, still scanning the store. \"So, are we actually shopping here? Or have we just decided to appreciate the local vampire colony's wardrobe?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" you admit, your voice quieter than you meant it to be. \"It's kind of... intense. I don't know how to describe it, I just feel like the mannequins are about to start moving.\"\n\nJessica smirks, nudging your arm lightly. \"Don't look away. They can smell fear.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the tip,\" you say dryly.\n\nYou're still soaking in the décor—if you can call creeping vinyl posters, looping CRT glitch videos, and a looming neon sign that says \"BITE ME\" décor—when the curtain behind the counter rustles.\n\nThen she appears.\n\nThe girl who steps out has presence. Not the kind that shouts, but the kind that sinks its teeth in. Chunky boots that hit the ground like a war drum. Fishnets, a high-waisted pleated skirt, and a shredded band tee with a skull design you're pretty sure was drawn in someone's blood. Her black lipstick is immaculate, sharp in a way that makes you wonder if she uses it as a weapon. A moon pendant larger than a toddler sits in front of her chest.\n\nShe pauses, eyes sweeping the store, landing right on you.\n\n\"You look like you're trying to convince yourself you're not into this,\" she says, voice flat but playful. \"Newsflash—people don't walk into my store by accident.\"\n\nYou blink. \"I... wasn't gonna buy anything.\"\n\nShe raises a single, skeptical brow. \"Sure, sure. Just browsing. Everyone's just browsing. Until the clothing speaks to you and then suddenly you're reevaluating your whole personality.\"\n\n\"She's got a point,\" Samantha states.\n\nThe salesgirl smiles, just a little, like she's pleased with herself. \"Come on. I'll show you something.\"\n\nShe turns, the chains on her belt jangling with every step as she leads you through the dim-lit racks and shelves. There are shirts with cryptic phrases, corsets that look like they're built for battle, and jackets that could double as armor. She walks with the confidence of someone who knows every square inch of the space and isn't afraid to test you in it.\n\n\"There was a system wipe last week,\" she says over her shoulder. \"We lost half the inventory. Corporate called it 'inventory corruption.' I call it a spiritual cleansing.\"\n\nShe stops in front of a lone display hanger like she's presenting an offering to the fashion gods.\n\n\"But this?\" she says. \"This survived. And I kept it in the back because, honestly, I didn't want just anyone getting their hands on it.\"\n\nShe pulls it forward with one hand.\n\nIt's an outfit.\n\nThe dress is black—of course—but not in a boring way. It's soft and velvety, off-shoulder with long sleeves that flare just a bit. There's a subtle lace trim along the hem, like the edge of something forgotten and romantic. A thin belt wraps around the middle, with a silver heart-shaped buckle that catches the low light just enough to sparkle. Attached to the hanger are a pair of fishnet tights, and below that—your eyes catch on the boots.\n\nPlatform combat boots. Polished black with silver buckles, thick soles, and enough presence to stomp through someone's soul.\n\n\"This one never made it to the floor,\" she says, holding it like something sacred. \"It was supposed to be scrapped. I pulled it before it got tossed. I mean, look at it. This isn't for a window mannequin. This is for someone with taste.\"\n\nJessica steps in closer, folding her arms as she gives the outfit a long, skeptical look. \"Okay, at first glance? Not really my thing,\" she admits, her voice even, like she's preparing to deliver a gentle but honest verdict. She tilts her head slightly, studying the velvet texture and the stitching along the belt. Then she leans in a bit, running her fingers lightly along the sleeve. \"But... damn. This is actually really high quality. The details are insane.\"\n\nShe takes another moment, stepping back to look at the whole ensemble again. \"Goth isn't really my style. I think that part is obvious. But if I was goth? Yeah. I'd definitely buy this. No question.\"\n\nThe salesgirl perks up a little, leaning one elbow casually on a nearby rack. \"That's because it's really high quality. All the parts were imported. I was this close to just buying it myself.\" She tilts her head toward you, smirking. \"But I figured someone with potential would walk in eventually.\"\n\n\"Potential?\" you ask, blinking. \"I haven't even put it on yet.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" she says. \"Yet you're already giving off the right energy for it.\"\n\n\"It's seriously good,\" Samantha says. \"You'd give off Aurora vibes.\"\n\nYou rub at the back of your neck. \"I don't know. I mean, it's nice, but I don't exactly scream 'brooding dark sorcerer.'\"\n\nThe salesgirl crosses her arms, still smiling faintly. \"That's the point. You don't have to scream it. The outfit does the work for you. You just exist in it, and suddenly people are rethinking everything they thought they knew about you.\"\n\n\"She's right,\" Jessica says, humming thoughtfully at that. \"It's dramatic in a good way. You'd look like you're trying something new and succeeding.\"\n\nYou give her a skeptical look. \"You really think I could pull this off?\"\n\n<<if [jessicaRomance] > 9>> \n Jessica meets your gaze, and for a moment, it feels like the rest of the store fades into background noise. Her voice drops just a little, becoming softer and more personal. \"I really do. You'd look... amazing.\"\n\n The way she says it makes your chest feel tight in a way that has nothing to do with the outfit.\n\n \n Jessica meets your gaze with the kind of calm confidence that makes her hard to argue with. \"Yeah,\" she says firmly, nodding once. \"You'd pull it off. No question.\"\n\n The tone she says it in makes it hard not to at least consider believing her.\n \n\nSamantha, of course, ruins the quiet moment by nudging you with her elbow. \"You're just scared you're gonna like it.\"\n\nYou sigh, glancing back at the dress.\n\nThe sales attendant takes the hanger from you and flips it in her hand. \"Try it. Or don't. But if you don't, I guarantee some watered-down TikTok goth wannabe is gonna wander in later and ruin its potential.\"\n\nYou sigh.\n\n\"Well?\" she asks, raising her eyebrow. \"The fitting room's open and the mirror doesn't bite.\"\n\n[Choice: Try it on]\n[Choice: Decide against wearing it]",

The lace trim brushes your knuckles—soft, weightless—and yet it sends a subtle pull through your chest. Not quite adrenaline. Not quite nerves. Something between the two. Like cracking open a door you didn't even realize was there.\n\n You glance toward the salesgirl. She's leaned against a rack now, arms crossed and one black boot resting on its heel like this is just another Tuesday. Her dark lipstick hasn't smudged a bit, but she hasn't lost her edge—but the sharpness in her expression has eased. No smug smirk, no teasing. Just a quiet, steady look that says more than words could.\n\n You swallow. \"Alright,\" you say, voice barely above the hum of the store's moody playlist. \"I'll try it.\"\n\n Her eyes gleam like moonlight catching on a knife's edge. \"Good,\" she says simply, and hands it over like she's passing you a relic meant only for the worthy.\n\n The hanger feels heavier now. Or maybe it's just the weight of the moment.\n\n Samantha watches you with a raised eyebrow. \"You're really gonna go for it?\" she asks, but there's no mockery in it. Just a hint of surprised. And maybe even a little pride.\n\n \"Well, I think it's a good call,\" Jessica says, tilting her head toward you. \"You don't have to like it, but at least see how it feels. Sometimes you don't know if something works until you see yourself in it.\"\n\n \"I mean, I'm already here, right?\" you mutter, and head toward the fitting rooms before you can talk yourself out of it.\n\n The fitting room curtain sighs closed behind you, swallowing you into a dim little pocket of space. One overhead bulb buzzes in mild protest, casting uneven shadows across the floor. A full-length mirror leans against the wall.\n\n You hang the outfit gently, then start to change.\n\n The dress slides over your shoulder like it's always known where to settle. The fabric is soft but structured; it hugs, but it doesn't cling. The off-shoulder cut brushes against your collarbones, the sleeves loose and billowy down to the wrist. The belt wraps snug at your waist, the buckle clicking into place with a finality that somehow feels symbolic. You tug on the fishnets, then step into the combat boots. You feel... taller. Not just physically. Like you take up a little more space in the world now, and for once, that isn't a bad thing.\n\n You turn slowly to face the mirror.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n And stop.\n\n You blink, once. Twice.\n\n The person staring back feels like someone you've met before in dreams. Maybe in moments of stillness. A you that's softer where it counts. Someone quiet, confident, not trying to shrink or guess what other people expect. The boots are bold, the lace is tender, and the look in your eyes is—\n\n Well. Something new.\n\n You tilt your head.\n\n Yeah. Maybe this isn't what you'd wear to school, or even out on a normal day. But in this moment? You look kind of incredible.\n\n From the other side of the curtain, the salesgirl's voice breaks through: \"Well? You still alive in there, or did the mirror swallow you?\"\n\n You let out a breath you didn't realize you were holding.\n\n \"It's...\" You hesitate, then smile, even though no one can see it. \"Kind of awesome, actually.\"\n\n You hear the faintest, smug little hum from beyond the curtain.\n\n \"Told you.\"\n\n [Choice: Step outside]\n\n \n You stop just short of taking the dress. It hangs there like a dare—dark, dramatic, and unapologetically bold. The lace flutters faintly in the low air-conditioning like it's breathing. There's a small, traitorous part of you that wants to know how it would feel, how it would look. How you'd look.\n\n But your hand doesn't move.\n\n Instead, you let out a quiet exhale and take a small step back.\n\n \"It's cool,\" you say. \"But... it's not really me.\"\n\n The sales associate's fingers freeze mid-swing on the hanger. She's good—recovers fast—but you catch the flicker of disappointment before it slips behind a polite nod.\n\n \"No worries,\" she says, tone smooth and even. \"Not everyone wants to look like a sad poem and a riot had a baby.\" She gently returns the hanger to its hook, letting the fabric settle like a sigh. \"Still. You had the vibe for it. Just sayin'.\"\n\n \"Yeah, can't deny that,\" Jessica says, studying the outfit as the sales associate puts it back where it was. \"You had the potential. It would've been interesting to see.\"\n\n \"Yup,\" Samantha echoes. \"I mean, I get it. It is a lot.\"\n\n \"Maybe,\" you say awkwardly. \"But I think I'll leave the look for someone braver.\"\n\n \"Anyway, you know what you like,\" Jessica says. \"That's what really matters. No point forcing it.\"\n\n You nod.\n\n \"Alright,\" Samantha says, clapping her hands once like she's resetting the mood. \"Let's blow this crypt and find somewhere less haunted.\"\n\n Jessica laughs softly, and the three of you make your way toward the door. As it swings shut behind you, the music fades and the daring dress disappears back into the dark.\n\n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

      "text": "<<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You take a deep and grounding breath. One hand grips the edge of the curtain, the other lightly touches your waist where the belt clinches tight. The cold press of the little heart-shaped ring sits at your fingertips, and the fabric hangs heavier than you're used to. Not uncomfortable at all. Just.. deliberate. Like it's framing you, instead of hiding you.\n\n Your heart's beating fast, but it's not fear. Not really. It's closer to anticipation—like you just fell and are unsure whether you're about to fall or fly.\n\n And then you step out.\n\n Your boots land on the polished concrete with a soft but solid thud, each step echoing just slightly in the quiet stretch between the fitting rooms and the racks of oversized black sweaters. You look up—and there, at the end of the hall, a tall mirror framed in flickering LED vines waits.\n\n You see yourself.\n\n And everything halts.\n\n You don't look like you're pretending. Or dressing up as someone else. You don't look like a joke.\n\n Instead, you look like a version of yourself that makes sense. Like someone you've been slowly circling for a long time but never quite dared to approach.\n\n The salesgirl looks up first, and her face brightens like she just got confirmation she was right all along. \"Oh,\" she says, slow and deliberate, a sly smile tugging at her lips. \"Now that works. That's the kind of transformation I like to see.\"\n\n Samantha looks up from a table of studded wristbands, one eyebrow raised, a snarky remark clearly forming—but it never arrives. She pauses. Actually pauses.\n\n \"Oh,\" she says, blinking. \"Okay, damn. Look at you. You look great.\"\n\n You can't help the small, embarrassed grin creeping onto your face. \"I... actually kind of like it,\" you admit, brushing a hand down the dress. \"It feels good. Like, I don't know. Different, sure, but in a good way.\"\n\n Jessica takes a moment, but her expression quickly softens. \"Wow,\" she says warmly. \"I suppose that's the magic of ShatterBox. I'm honestly impressed. You kind of own that outfit.\"\n\n Your cheeks feel warm at that, and you shift slightly in the boots. \"You really think so? I was worried I'd look ridiculous.\"\n\n \"Not even a little,\" Jessica says, shaking her head. \"It looks like you. Or at least, a version of you that feels... confident.\"\n\n You glance down at yourself again, at the boots, the lace trim, the soft sleeves brushing your arms. Then back at your reflection. Your posture's a little straighter now. Your jaw set without thinking.\n\n \"I kind of... love it,\" you admit.\n\n \n You ease the curtain open, one hand still gripping the fabric like it might be a shield. The boots thud quietly on the floor as you step out, the dress trailing just slightly behind you with each movement—too fluid, too noticeable. Your arms cross instinctively over your chest, shoulders hunched a little tighter than usual, like that might make the whole thing feel less... loud.\n\n The salesgirl's black lipstick curves into a small, approving smile. \"Well,\" she says, crossing her arms. \"That's a look. You clean up nice.\"\n\n \"Wow,\" Jessica says after a beat. \"You actually pull that off better than I thought you would. And I already thought you'd look great.\"\n\n Samantha, of course, throws both hands up in mock celebration. \"Behold! My spooky little creation has emerged from the cocoon!\" She steps back, takes in the whole look, then adds, \"Okay, those boots are insane. You're basically a threat now.\"\n\n \"I... don't know,\" you say, shifting your weight awkwardly. \"It feels... weird.\"\n\n You stand awkwardly, shifting your weight from one boot to the other. The belt digs a little where it sits across your hips—noticeable in a way you're not used to. The neckline feels too open, the hem just slightly too short. You're aware of every inch of fabric. You don't hate how it looks exactly, but wearing it feels like stepping into someone else's outline. Not quite yours.\n\n The salesgirl approaches with a slanted smile, her arms still folded as she scans you up and down. \"I can't lie,\" she says, tilting her head, \"that's a strong silhouette.\"\n\n You manage a half-smile. \"I guess that's a vibe.\"\n\n \"Oh, it's definitely a vibe,\" she replies. \"I've seen way worse first tries. You're pulling it off more than you think.\"\n\n You nod, tugging subtly at the sleeve where it slides down your arm again. \"It's cool. The issue is that it doesn't really feel like me.\"\n\n Samantha catches your expression and dials it back a notch. \"Hey,\" she says. \"It's okay if it's not your thing. You don't have to like it.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" Jessica agrees. \"There's no pressure. You don't have to commit to something you're not comfortable in.\"\n\n You let out a breath and glance down at the fishnets and boots like they're mocking you. \"I think I just wanted to see. But I don't think this is me.\"\n\n The salesgirl shrugs. \"Fair enough,\" she says. \"At least you gave it a show. That's more than most people do when they come in here.\"\n\n \"Honestly? That's what shopping's for,\" Jessica reassures. \"You try things, see how they feel, and figure out what actually fits you.\"\n\n \"Plus, we know what you'd look like if you ever became emo now,\" Samantha says, smirking again. \"So, that's a win.\"\n\n You can't help but laugh a little at that.\n\n The salesgirl gives a little two-finger salute. \"Door's open if you ever change your mind, though.\"\n\n You nod, grateful. You don't hate what you see in the mirror. But you're not sure if it's a door you're ready to walk through.\n\n Still... you gave it a shot. That counts for something.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

The outfit doesn't feel like a costume anymore. It's snug in the right places, drapes in the right places—like it knew what it was doing long before you ever touched it. You can't quite name what you're feeling, only that it's unfamiliar and a little louder than you expected.\n\nSamantha's leaning against the edge of a nearby display table, arms folded, phone long forgotten. Her head is tilted slightly, her eyes flicking between your reflection and the real you—almost as if she's trying to decide if they're the same person. She's quiet. Not in the awkward way, but in the rare, thinking-too-hard way.\n\nJessica stands a few feet away, her hands clasped loosely in front of her. \"You know,\" she says finally, breaking the silence, \"that outfit looks like it's supposed to be yours.\"\n\nYou glance at her through the mirror. \"You think so?\"\n\nJessica nods, smiling faintly. \"Yeah. It's a big shift from your usual style, but it works.\"\n\n\"Same,\" Samantha says. \"Honestly, I was worried you'd come out looking like you were wearing a Halloween costume. But no. You actually pull it off. Kinda annoyingly well.\"\n\nThe salesgirl makes her way over, her boots tapping a steady rhythm across the floor. She walks like someone who's used to being in charge, shoulders relaxed and gaze sharp. Arms crossed, she stops a few steps away and scans you head to toe, her smirk lazy but genuine.\n\n\"So,\" she says, tilting her head. \"You buying it or just blessing the store with a one-time appearance?\"\n\nYou blink. \"The whole outfit?\" You glance down at yourself. \"Dress, boots, belt, choker, fishnets? All of it?\"\n\n\"The full look,\" she confirms. \"It's cohesive, don't you think?\"\n\nYou open your mouth, then close it again. \"It looks expensive.\"\n\n\"It probably is expensive,\" Samantha mutters under her breath, still watching your reflection like it might say something first.\n\n\"How much?\" you ask.\n\n\"Fifty bucks,\" the girl says.\n\nYou stop.\n\n\"...Fifty for everything?\"\n\nShe nods once, bored and smug. \"Corporate glitch. Inventory system threw a tantrum, clearance tag stacked on each other, I bundled it as a display fit to save time. Should be like two hundred, minimum, The boots alone usually retail for eighty.\"\n\nShe taps the side of her head. \"Indie belt maker, hand-stitched fishnets, locally made choker by some girl with a soldering iron—basically boutique quality across the board.\"\n\nJessica looks mildly stunned. \"Fifty for all that? That's kind of ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Some kind of chaos coupon magic,\" Samantha mutters, shaking her head.\n\n\"Exactly,\" the salesgirl says with a grin. \"So, are you taking advantage of it or what?\"\n\nYou glance at Jessica.\n\n\"If you like it even a little, I think it's worth getting,\" Jessica says, meeting your gaze with a nod. \"You're not going to find a deal like that again.\"\n\nYou glance at Samantha.\n\n\"I mean... you kind of killed it,\" Samantha says, tilting her head. \"For this price, I don't know. I think it's a good deal.\"\n\nYou glance back at the glass, half-expecting the reflection to crack or laugh or shake its head.\n\nBut it doesn't.\n\nIt just stands there like it's been waiting for you to catch up.\n\nThe salesgirl's tone dips, just a little. \"No pressure,\" she says. \"But if you feel even a little like you belong in that, I'd hold onto it. Most people aren't a good match for it.\"\n\nYour fingers graze the edge of the dress again. The hem sways gently with the motion, brushing against your legs. You can feel your pulse beneath your skin.\n\n\"So?\" the salesgirl prompts again, voice light but pointed.\n\nSamantha leans in a little, eyebrow raised.\n\nYour reflection doesn't blink.\n\nNeither do you.\n\n<<if [money] > 49>> \n [Choice: Buy it]\n \n[Choice: Don't buy it]",

The dress clings just enough, the boots make you feel grounded, and the belt, absurdly, feels like armor. There's a version of you staring back that looks self-assured and cinematic—like they walked straight out of a dream.\n\n \"I want it,\" you say, voice firm and quieter than expected.\n\n The goth salesgirl grins instantly, like she's been sitting on that smile the whole time. \"I fucking knew it. You've got the cheekbones and spirit for the outfit.\"\n\n Samantha makes a sound that's somewhere between a scoff and a laugh. \"Okay, wow. You're actually going for it.\"\n\n \"I knew you'd go for it,\" Jessica beams. \"You look too good in that to walk away.\"\n\n You step forward—still wearing the full outfit—and she doesn't ask you to take it off.\n\n \"Okay, look, technically I'm supposed to make people change before ringing them up,\" she says, unlocking the register. She glances up at you. \"But honestly? For this? We're gonna pretend that rule never existed. The vibes are too strong.\"\n\n She types something into the register, taps the screen, and then nods at the total. \"Fifty even. And let me be very clear: that's criminally cheap. Like, you should be arrested for getting away with it.\"\n\n You tap your phone against the reader without hesitation. The soft beep confirms the sale.\n\n The salesgirl peels the tags off with an efficient flick and hands you the tiny bag with your old clothes inside. \"There,\" she says, leaning back against the counter. \"Now you're part of the aesthetic. Wear it out. Let the world deal with it.\"\n\n Samantha gives you a playful once-over as you sling the bag over your shoulder. \"Look at you,\" she says, half-proud, half-teasing. \"All broody. I'm gonna have to step up my game.\"\n\n You pause for half a second, then nod.\n\n Outside the store, the light feels brighter, but you don't flinch from it. The boots thud softly as you walk, the choker catching the overhead lights in glints. Samantha falls in beside you, one eyebrow raised in appraisal.\n\n \"You really did it,\" she says. \"You actually wore the dress.\"\n\n You glance over at her, feeling the weight of it settle on your shoulders.\n\n \"I did.\"\n\n \"And?\" she asks.\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You don't rush your answer. \"It feels... right.\"\n\n Samantha smirks. \"Knew it.\" She punches your arm lightly. \"You're still a dork, though. Just a slightly more dangerous-looking one.\"\n\n You don't mind. Not even a little.\n \n \n You hesitate before answering. \"...It's interesting,\" you say finally. \"I don't even know why I bought it, it's not really me.\"\n\n Samantha watches you for a beat, then nods like she gets it. \"Fair enough.\" She gives you a quick smile. \"Still a dork either way. Just one in a cooler outfit now.\"\n\n You let out a soft laugh. It doesn't feel perfect—but it doesn't feel like a mistake either.\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n You stand there for a moment longer, still facing the mirror.\n\n The outfit fits. It really does. Something about it clicks. But even so... it doesn't feel like something you can take home.\n\n You take a small breath, steadying yourself, and turn away from your reflection.\n \n \"I think I'm gonna pass,\" you say, your voice quiet but clear.\n\n The salesgirl arches a brow, surprised—but not offended. \"Sure. Little disappointing, but your call.\"\n\n \"It was nice,\" you say, your voice quiet. \"But I think I'm just... not there yet.\"\n\n She studies you for a second longer. Then nods. \"Fair enough.\"\n\n From a few feet away, Samantha leans against a display case, eyes fixed on you like she's watching a scene unfold in her favorite show.\n\n \"You sure?\" she says, tilting her head. \"Because you kinda walked out looking like you'd just been summoned from a vampire coven in Transylvania.\"\n\n <<if [study] > 84>> \n You snort. \"I'm not qualified to dress like I belong in Romania.\"\n \n \n You snort. \"I don't even know where Transylvania is.\"\n \n\n \"It's fine,\" she says, brushing imaginary dust from her jacket. \"You looked cool. Like, 'accidentally started a cult' cool. In a good way.\"\n\n \"You don't have to explain yourself, [name],\" Jessica says touching your arm lightly. \"Just change back.\"\n\n You smile faintly, ducking back into the changing room.\n\n Taking the outfit off is harder than you expect. Not physically—it slides off just fine—but it feels like shedding something more than fabric. Like unfastening the version of you that only gets to exist inside mirrors.\n\n You fold everything with care before stepping out.\n\n The salesgirl takes it without a word. Her smirk is gone now—replaced by something almost thoughtful. \"If you change your mind,\" she says, \"I've got the whole ensemble for a little longer. Just ask for it.\"\n\n You offer a nod in return. \"Thanks.\"\n\n Back in the mall, the air feels a little too bright. You blink against the sterile lights. Samantha falls into step beside you, hands shoved deep in her pockets.\n\n \"You know,\" she says, \"I was fully expecting you to buy it and then instantly regret it once someone's grandma gave you a weird look.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath. \"Would've served me right.\"\n\n \"It's just clothes,\" Jessica says, offering a reassuring pat on your shoulder as you all head toward the door. \"You'll figure out what feels right. You've got time.\"\n\n You smile, soft and small, as the mall swallows you both back into its steady hum.\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

It's like a candy store for people with taste.\"\n\n\"Or for people who like blinding fluorescent lighting,\" Samantha mutters, shoving her hands into her pockets.\n\n\"You don't like candy stores?\" Jessica asks.\n\n\"I like candy stores that don't make me feel like I'm about to be peer-pressured into buying shoes.\"\n\nYou make a beeline toward the sneaker wall, where a bright display labeled Vektix Collection catches your eye.\n\nThe first pair you reach for are the Vektix BreezeAir Lows—crisp white with delicate blue butterflies stitched along the sides, the pattern subtle enough to not feel loud, but detailed enough to feel special. The design almost shimmers under the overhead light.\n\nJessica tilts her head. \"These are so cute. I'd wear those in a heartbeat.\"\n\nSamantha gives them a look like they've personally wrong. \"Hmm. Those are dangerously close to you becoming a Soft Pastel Person.\" \n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Dangerously?\"\n\n\"Like... if I see you in those, I'll assume you own a planner and know how to braid other people's hair. Which, to be clear, I fully support. I'm just saying, there's a whole vibe baked into those butterflies.\"\n\nYou glance down at the shoes, lips curving slightly. You can't say she's entirely wrong.\n\nA few steps over, another pair screams for attention—Vektix SwiftCharge Trainers.These are practically vibrating with energy: jagged hot-pink soles, orange laces, and a glossy finish that almost feels like it should hum when you pick it up.\n\n\"Oh wow,\" Jessica exclaims. \"These are loud. Like, festival-loud.\"\n\n\"They're not loud. They're... energetic,\" you counter.\n\n\"They're a threat,\" Samantha says, shaking her head. \"I feel like they'd just drag you into spontaneous parkour.\"\n\n\"They do look fast.\"\n\n\"No one wearing those bothers to walk, [name]. They dart. They leap over benches and vault escalators.\"\n\nYou can't help but grin. \"So... not for you, then.\"\n\n\"I'm allergic to cardio,\" Samantha says, giving you a flat look.\n\n\"Well, I love them,\" Jessica says. \"They're chaotic in an intentional way. Like, you'd have to commit to them with a whole outfit.\"\n\nYou keep moving and land at a trio of SomaSoft Flats—white, black, and brown. No branding, no frills. Just clean lines and quiet, reliable design.\n\n\"Now these are the sensible ones,\" Jessica says, sounding almost approving. \"Minimalist, goes with everything. Honestly? You could use a pair like that.\"\n\n\"They're the shoe equivalent of a tax form,\" Samantha cuts in. \"Efficient. Reasonable. Emotionally neutral. If you buy those, I'll assume you've given up on personality entirely.\"\n\n\"They're practical, you know,\" you respond.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not judging,\" she says. \"Actually, I am, but with love. I know your style. You like pretending you're mysterious and understated. These are very 'Don't perceive me, but also I dress on purpose.'\"\n\nThen, tucked near the bottom row of a slightly recessed shelf, your eyes catch on a more hidden pair—SeraForm Streetlace Lights. Low-top, all white, matte finish, minimal in the best way. They don't scream. They don't beg for attention. But they're sharp—precise, even.\n\nSamantha leans in as you crouch for a closer look.\n\n\"Ooh. See, those are dangerous in a different way,\" she murmurs. \"Clean lines, sleek shape, total sleeper pick. You wear those, you're not trying to impress anyone—you're just inherently cool.\"\n\nJessica nods in agreement. \"Those are nice. Like, timeless nice. You could pair those with almost anything.\"\n\nYou straighten up, look at all the shoes, and then glance at Jessica and Samantha. \"So what I'm hearing is you'll judge me no matter what I pick.\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" Samantha corrects.\n\n\"Supportively,\" Jessica adds, smiling.\n\nA store associate passes and nods politely. Samantha gestures toward the bench nearby, already nudging you toward it. \"Go on, Cinderella. Let's see if they fit.\"\n\nTime to try something on.\n\n[Choice: Try on the shoes]",

      "text": "You slip off the shoe you were trying on and place it neatly back on the bench. The cushion beneath you hisses faintly as you shift your weight. Jessica lingers nearby, surveying the choices. Her long blonde ponytail swings slightly as she tilts her head, an easy smile tugging at her lips.\n\n\"So?\" she says, her voice light but genuinely curious. \"Any favorites? You looked pretty deep in thought over there.\"\n\nSamantha stands nearby, arms crossed loosely, tapping the heel of one sneaker against the floor like she's barely holding back a thousand opinions.\n\n\"Yeah, seriously,\" she adds. \"Do they give you the power of flight? Or are we talking 'subtle upgrades' here?\"\n\nYou roll your ankle a bit. \"Honestly? Kinda great. Light, comfy. I think I'm done trying stuff on.\"\n\nJessica beams a little, like she's proud of you for coming to a decision. \"That's good! StepUp's kind of my go-to for shoes,\" she says, glancing toward a wall of neatly displayed sneakers. \"I've gotten, like, half my collection from here. They usually hold up pretty well. Their prices are the same as online stores too.\"\n\nSamantha lets out an exaggerated sigh, tossing her beanie back slightly. \"We gather here today to honor [name]'s ankles,\" she intones solemnly. \"May they forever be blister-free and fashionably supported.\"\n\nBefore you can respond, a sales associate approaches—crew-cut, crisp store polo, clipboard tucked under one arm, and an approachable smile already in place.\n\n\"Looks like you're weighing some options,\" he says warmly, glancing down at the neat line of shoes you've already set out.\n\nYou nod. \"Yeah, just figuring out what fits best. Could I get the prices?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" He flips the clipboard and starts down the row.\n\n\"First, the BreezeAir Lows with the butterfly design. That's a limited, designer collab—forty dollars. They're pretty in-demand right now.\"\n\n\"Oh, those are beautiful,\" Jessica says, leaning closer to take a look. \"They'd look so good with lighter colors. Definitely a statement, but still subtle.\"\n\n\"Delicate and dangerous,\" Samantha whispers. \"Like [name] when he's hungry.\"\n\n<<if [acceptance] > 19>> \n \"I am not dangerous,\" you say.\n\n \n \"I am not delicate,\" you say.\n \n\nThe associate moves on to the neon trainers. \"These SwiftCharge Trainers feature breathable mesh and NeonGrip soles—designed for active days. Thirty dollars.\"\n\n\"Those are... fun,\" Jessica says with a grin. \"Super bold. You'd definitely stand out in those.\"\n\n\"I can't condone these,\" Samantha mutters, squinting at them like they personally offended her. \"These shoes look like they'll drag you into a spontaneous rave.\"\n\nJessica laughs. \"Oh, come on. They're playful! Not everything has to be understated.\"\n\nThe associate then gestures toward the flats. \"The SomaSoft options—white, black, and brown—are everyday classics at fifteen dollars combined.\"\n\n\"You can't really go wrong with those,\" Jessica says, nodding approvingly. \"They'd work for basically anything.\"\n\nSamantha shrugs. \"They're the introverts of footwear. Boring, but functional. Not mad about it.\"\n\nFinally, the associate gestures to the pair you just took off—SeraForm StreetLace Lights, the matte white low-tops.\n\n\"Those are twenty. Classic look, low-profile, versatile. One of our bestsellers, actually.\"\n\nYou glance back at them. They're clean, sharp, and feel like a safe choice.\n\nHe flips his clipboard and offers a small nod. \"Take your time. I can box them up when you're ready.\"\n\nJessica crouches slightly to get one more look at the options. \"Honestly, you picked some good options,\" she says, her voice warm. \"I think you'd look great in any of them. Just go with what feels the most like you.\"\n\nSamantha elbows you lightly. \"No pressure,\" she adds with a smirk. \"But your choice will forever define how I roast you.\"\n\nYou look back down at the options—each of them saying something different.\n\nIt's time to choose.\n\n[Choice: Choose some shoes to get]",

      "text": "You stare at the lineup of shoes a moment longer—white butterflies, screaming neon, quiet flats, sleek matte low-tops.\n\n They're all fine. Great, even. But something in your chest is pulling tight in that subtle, invisible way it sometimes does. Like when you're standing in front of a shelf full of choices and none of them feel exactly right, even if they should. Not today. Not yet.\n\n You exhale and lean back on the bench. In the end, you slip your own shoes back on and stand up.\n\n Jessica steps closer, following your gaze to the lineup. \"None of them feel right?\" she asks, her tone light but sympathetic.\n\n You shake your head. \"They're nice. Just... I don't think I'm ready to spend money on something I'm not totally sold on.\"\n\n \"That makes sense,\" Jessica says with a little nod. \"Shoes are long-term commitments. You'll know when it's the right pair.\"\n\n Samantha crosses her arms. \"Translation: you didn't get those 'these are my shoes' lightning bolt moment.\"\n\n \"Is that a real thing?\" you ask.\n\n She shrugs. \"I mean, yeah? You put them on, and suddenly you're like, 'Ah yes, I'm powerful and these shoes will carry me to victory.'\"\n\n \"That is so not how it works for most people,\" Jessica comments.\n\n \"For me it is,\" Samantha says, deadpan.\n\n As you turn toward the front of the store, the associate from earlier spots you and steps forward. His clipboard is still in hand and his smile is still polite, if just a little dimmer.\n\n \"Find something you liked?\"\n\n You offer a small, apologetic smile. \"They were all great. I'm just gonna hold off for now.\"\n\n He nods, clearly trained for this exact moment. \"No worries. Happens all the time. Let us know if you changed your mind.\"\n\n He says it cheerfully enough, but there's that tiny flicker of disappointment, the barely-there sag in his posture as he steps aside. You give him a small nod of thanks as you pass, Samantha right beside you.\n\n Once you're through the sliding glass door and back into the open pulse of the mall. Your shoulders ease a little.\n\n \"Well,\" Samantha begins, \"we didn't find your perfect shoe soulmate, but hey—there's plenty of stores in the mall to conquer.\"\n\n You didn't leave with a new pair of shoes today—but that's okay. You went. You looked. Maybe next time you'll try again. And somehow, that feels like enough.\n\n \n \n You make your decision with a small breath through your nose, hand drifting to the pair that just feels right. You pick it up, letting your fingers glide along the edge one last time before you stand up.\n\n Jessica's the first to notice. \"Ohh,\" she says, stepping in close to get a look. Her tone's approving, but she adds with a grin, \"Very you. I can already picture them sitting by your front door.\"\n\n \"So that's the winner, huh?\" Samantha asks.\n\n You nod. \"Feels like it.\"\n\n \"Bold move,\" she says, inspecting the pair you picked. \"Courageous. Shoe critics will be divided for years.\"\n\n \"Pretty sure they won't,\" you mutter, heading toward the register.\n\n Jessica falls into step beside you. \"Honestly? I think you nailed it. StepUp has a bunch of good options, but you may have just gotten the best one here.\"\n\n Samantha pretends to gag. \"Oh no. Don't tell me I'm the only one in this group who still believes in rotating the same beat-up sneakers until they literally disintegrate.\"\n\n \"That's just you,\" Jessica fires back. \"The rest of us like having clean shoes.\"\n\n \"Excuse you,\" Samantha says. \"It's called practical chic. Very exclusive.\"\n\n You shake your head, already stepping up to the counter. The associate spots you approaching and perks up.\n\n \"Found the one?\" he asks as he slides behind the register.\n\n \"Yep.\"\n\n He nods, taking the box from your hands and flipping it open for a quick inspection. \"Good choice.\" He scans the tag, the price popping up on the small digital display with a confirming beep.\n\n You pull out your phone and double-click the side button. The tap of your device against the reader is met by a soft chime, followed be a cheerful \"Payment Approved\" on the screen.\n\n \"Nice,\" he says, tucking tissue paper inside the box and closing the lid with practiced care. \"You want the box in a bag or just like this?\"\n\n \"Bag, please.\"\n\n He slides the shoebox into a paper bag with the StepUp logo embossed across the front. It crinkles lightly as he passes it to you. \"Here you go. Hope you get some good wear out of them.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you say, adjusting the handles in your grip.\n\n Samantha joins you at the exit, glancing once at the bag, then at you. \"Ah, the sacred shoe ritual is complete. You've officially leveled up.\"\n\n You look down at the bag. It's not really about the shoes. It's about the small, steady decisions that make you feel more you.\n\n It's not a full reinvention, but it is a step. And isn't that exactly what shoes are for?\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

In fact, you might even like it.\"\n\n \"You two just gonna fight the whole way there?\" you ask.\n\n \"Probably,\" Jessica says lightly.\n\n \"Only if she keeps being wrong,\" Samantha adds.\n\n You shake your head and keep walking, but it doesn't take along until you spot Threadz.\n\n Samantha's grin widens. \"Finally,\" she says simply, picking up the pace as you all head toward the entrance.\n\n \"Let's just get this over with,\" Jessica says.\n\n \n \n The moment the words \"Threadz first\" leave your mouth, Samantha reacts like you just handed her a winning lottery ticket.\n\n \"YES!\" she shouts, throwing both fists in the air, startling a passing family of four. \"My best friend, [name] Yoon, chooses culture!\" She pins on her heel dramatically, pointing toward the store like some chaotic anime protagonist. \"To Threadz we go! You won't regret this. Probably.\"\n\n Jessica groans beside you, dragging out the sound like it physically pains her. \"Ugh. Threadz? Really? Who even shops there?\" She squints at the storefront like it personally insulted her. \"It looks like a clearance rack at a punk concert threw up and someone decided to sell the results.\"\n\n \"That's the point!\" Samantha fires back, eyes sparkling with unholy glee. \"It's art. It's rebellion. It's where we go to reject beige cardigans and emotional stability.\"\n\n \"Okay, rude,\" Jessica states. \"Beige cardigans can be cute if you style them correctly.\"\n\n \"You would say that,\" Samantha mutters with a smirk, already speed-walking toward the glowing chaos ahead.\n \n <<if [acceptance] > 19>> \n \"Don't be jealous just because I have taste,\" Jessica quips, tossing her hair as she follows. She suddenly pauses, walks back next to you, then lowers her voice. \"Threadz, [name]? Seriously? You don't even own eyeliner yet.\"\n \n \n \"Don't be jealous just because I have taste,\" Jessica quips, tossing her hair as she follows. She suddenly pauses, walks back next to you, then lowers her voice. \"Threadz, [name]? Seriously? You don't even own eyeliner.\"\n \n\n You shrug, hands in your pockets. \"Samantha seemed passionate. And, you know, she scares me a little when she's passionate.\"\n\n Jessica giggles. \"Fair.\"\n \n\nThreadz hits you the second you step in.\n\nThe music is a wall of fuzzy synth and punchy drums—somewhere between alt-pop and a caffeine overdose. The lighting's even harsher than the mall—bright overhead fluorescents that buzz faintly and wash everything in a slightly-too-white glow. The air smells like a mix of synthetic cotton, body spray, and something sharp that might be deodorant—or regret.\n\nSamantha practically skips inside. \"Oh my God. I'm home,\" she sighs, throwing her arms out like she's entering a holy space. \"Threadz, my beloved. You smell like chaos and social anxiety.\"\n\nYou glance around, still catching up. \"It's like if the internet had a very enthusiastic child.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" she beams, spinning slightly on her heel. \"Threadz doesn't make clothes, [name]. It makes statements. Like, this place understands that sometimes you need to dress like a cartoon character having a crisis.\"\n\nAnd honestly, she fits in perfectly.\n\nHer usual outfit could've walked straight off one of the mannequins: layered striped sleeves under a graphic tee, baggy high-waisted jeans cinched with a yellow \"CAUTION: KEEP OUT\" keychain belt, chunky sneakers with mismatched laces, and a beanie pinned with a smiley face and an alien. She's not trying to match the store—she simply is the store. Like some walking ambassador for chaos with charm.\n\nJessica leans toward you and mutters, \"I swear, she becomes louder in here.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's like her natural habitat,\" you say, snorting.\n\nShe holds up a mesh long-sleeve top and wiggles her eyebrows. \"This, but over a tank top, under a denim vest, with plaid pants and combat boots?\"\n\nJessica wrinkles her nose. \"Wow. What a bad combo,\" she says.\n\n\"Bad combo?\" Samantha asks. \"This is the best combo. It's chaos and creativity. It's middle fingers and mall food. It's—\" she flings her arms out dramatically \"—Threadz.\"\n\nBefore Jessica can retort, a guy with chipped black nail polish and hair dyed a violent shade of blue pops up behind a stack of tees. His name tag reads: \"Ash (he/him) - Certified Chaos Consultant.\"\n\n\"Let me know if you start spiraling about which graphic tee defines your soul,\" he says, voice perfectly flat.\n\n\"ASH!\" Samantha lights up. \"You're working today?!\"\n\nAsh smirks faintly. \"Back again to haunt the racks, huh?\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" Samantha says with zero shame. \"You act like I have other hobbies.\"\n\nJessica's mouth drops open. \"Wait, hold up.\" She points between the two of them like she's piecing together a conspiracy. \"How do you even know each other?\"\n\nAsh glances over at Jessica for the first time, his smirk turning mischievous. \"Did you bring your normie friends here, Sam?\"\n\nJessica bristles, caught between offense and trying not to look offended. \"Normie? Excuse me?\"\n\n\"Relax,\" Ash says, shrugging lazily as he starts refolding a shirt, like he didn't just drop a grenade in the conversation. \"It's not an insult. Just an observation.\"\n\nSamantha laughs, clapping Ash on the shoulder. \"Yeah, I brought them. But they're cool. Even Jessica.\"\n\n\"Even me?\" Jessica asks, blinking.\n\n\"Especially you,\" Samantha adds sweetly, but the glint in her eyes says she's enjoying this far too much.\n\nYou can't help but laugh, half at Jessica's incredulous expression and half at the way Samantha looks like she just scored points in an invisible game only she's playing.\n\nJessica sighs, muttering under her breath, \"I cannot believe I agreed to this,\" but you catch the small upward curve of her lips.\n\nAsh looks at you then, deadpan but with a weirdly inviting edge. \"So, you ready to find the one shirt in here that'll reveal your soul? Or are you just here to watch her,\" he tilts his head at Samantha, \"perform her usual Threadz pilgrimage?\"\n\nYou raise your hands in mock defense. \"Honestly? Still figuring that out.\"\n\nThe chaotic Threadz energy is working exactly as intended.\n\n[Choice: Try some tops on]",

One second she's next to you making jokes about graphic tees, the next she's elbow-deep in a clearance bin. Jessica, meanwhile, is still hovering near the entrance like she's worried the store will rub off on her, arms crossed and face twisted into a mix of amusement and horror.\n\n\"This place smells like energy drinks and sadness,\" Jessica mutters, fiddling with her phone like it might act as a protective barrier.\n\n\"That's the aesthetic,\" Samantha calls out from somewhere deep in the hoodies. \"God, keep up.\"\n\nYou're still debating if you should try to blend in or just stand still and hope no one notices you when Samantha reappears with the kind of triumphant grin that promises trouble. In her arms are three pieces of fabric that look like they were designed during a caffeine-fueled fever dream.\n\n\"Behold!\" she announces, practically shoving the first one at your chest—a beige hoodie with deep brown sleeves and a giant butterfly splashed across the front. \"This says: 'I'm mysterious and outdoorsy, but also approachable.' Perfect.\"\n\nBefore you can respond, she slaps a white graphic tee on top of it, the front featuring a giant waffle cone overflowing with scoops of ice cream shaped like cartoon guinea pigs. \"This one says: 'I don't take myself too seriously.' Which, honestly, is a good vibe for you.\"\n\nJessica leans in to look and blinks. \"Are... are those supposed to be hamsters?\"\n\n\"Guinea pigs,\" Samantha corrects without missing a beat. \"Show some respect.\"\n\nJessica makes a face like she's not entirely sure respect is the right response. \"It's... cute? I guess?\"\n\n\"And finally, this bad boy!\" Samantha says with flair, pulling out a bright pink anime tee with a smug-looking girl kicking over the word \"GAME OVER YOU LOSE.\"\n\nJessica physically recoils. \"Oh my God. That's certainly aggressive.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Samantha says, looking proud. \"This one says: 'I am chaos incarnate, and you can't stop me.'\"\n\n\"Or it says you lost a bet,\" Jessica mutters under her breath.\n\nSamantha ignores her, thrusting all three pieces into your arms with zero room for debate. \"Try them on, [name].\"\n\nYou stare at the stack in your hands, then back at her. \"All of them? Right now?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Samantha says firmly, planting her hands on her hips. \"We are not leaving until we find out which one makes you look the least like you wandered in here by accident.\"\n\nJessica sighs but steps closer, curiosity clearly winning out over her disdain. \"Honestly... I kind of want to see this too.\"\n\nYou glance between the two of them—Jessica's expectant raised eyebrows, Samantha's unblinking determination—and realize there's no escape.\n\n\"I don't think—\" you start, but Samantha cuts you off by grabbing your wrist and dragging you toward the fitting rooms.\n\n\"Nope. No excuses. You're doing this,\" she says, practically shoving you toward the nearest empty room. \"We are transforming you today. Character arc, remember?\"\n\nJessica trails behind, shaking her head but clearly entertained. \"At least if you get stuck in one of those shirts, we'll call for help.\"\n\n\"How generous,\" you mutter, clutching the clothes like a lifeline as Samantha pushes you inside the fitting room and yanks the curtain shut behind you.\n\nAnd just like that, you're alone with three shirts.\n\n[Choice: Wear the tops]",

The tiny fitting room mirror is rimmed with chipped stickers—smiley faces, pixel hearts, and a ghost giving a thumbs up. It feels more like a closet than a changing room, but still weirdly comforting.\n\nYou try the anime girl tee first. The pink practically shouts under the overhead light, and the chaotic design is even louder on your chest. For a second, you grimace. But then you realize it... actually kind of works. It's confident in its own strange way, like it knows it's over the top but doesn't care.\n\nThe guinea pig shirt is next. It's the exact opposite: softer, gentler, warm in tone and even warmer in vibe. You smile without meaning to. It's so dumb. Like, painfully so. But you like it.\n\nThen the hoodie.\n\nIt slides on like it's already yours. Oversized, but not in a bad way. The butterfly rests right over your heart, and something about it makes you pause. You pull the hood up for a second and glance in the mirror. You look like someone you might be okay being.\n\nYou hear a knock at the wall.\n\n\"All good in there?\" Ash calls. \"Heads-up, by the way—we're doing ten-dollar graphics today. Hoodies, tees, all of it.\"\n\nYou blink. \"All of it?\"\n\n\"Yup,\" he says. \"Clearance push. Manager's order. It's basically a steal.\"\n\nYou glance back at the three items. Only ten bucks each. You could actually get more than one without your wallet screaming.\n\nYou turn back to the mirror, heart tugging between impulse and logic.\n\n[Choice: Buy something]",

She's seated dramatically on a bench near the accessory wall, spinning a choker around one finger like a villain awaiting news of a conquest. \"So?\" she asks, eyes bright. \"What's the verdict? Which one's coming home with you? Or don't tell me—you're buying all of them. Bold. I respect it.\"\n\n You hesitate. Then sigh.\n\n \"Sam, I don't think I'm gonna get any of them.\"\n\n For one full second, there's silence.\n\n Her face falls in a way that's so exaggerated it circles right back around to funny. \"What?\"\n\n You shrug. \"They just didn't feel right. I don't know.\"\n\n \"But you looked good in them! The hoodie gave you mysterious loner energy. The guinea pig shirt was quirky. And the pink one? It was practically daring the world to fight you.\"\n\n \"I don't want the world to fight me,\" you say, placing down the tops gently. \"I want the world to leave me alone and maybe offer me a pretzel.\"\n\n Jessica, who has been idly examining a rack of studded scrunchies, finally turns to face you with a knowing smirk. \"See? This is exactly why I told you NovaTrend is better. Their clothes don't look like they're screaming for help.\"\n\n Samantha spins on her. \"Excuse me? This isn't about you being right, Jessica. This is about me mourning the tragic death of [name]'s fashion potential.\"\n\n \"I don't know about tragic,\" Jessica says, eyebrows raised. \"I think [name] just has taste.\"\n\n \"Bad taste,\" Samantha shoots back.\n\n \"Better than that shirt,\" Jessica retorts, nodding toward the bright pink anime graphic tee.\n\n You hold up your hands. \"Uh, hey. Remember me? The person actually wearing the clothes you're insulting?\"\n\n \"You were supposed to emerge from this store, reborn, [name]. A butterfly in a graphic tee. Not a—\" she waves vaguely at you \"—sad little caterpillar.\"\n\n Jessica snorts. \"You're being dramatic.\"\n\n \"Dramatic?\" Samantha asks. \"Jessica. This is me being restrained.\"\n\n Jessica laughs, shaking her head. \"If this is restrained, I'd hate to see unrestrained.\"\n\n \"Ugh, I was so ready for you to buy those,\" Samantha groans. \"You could've been iconic.\"\n\n \"I don't think I'm built for iconic,\" you say.\n\n Jessica tilts her head thoughtfully. \"Not with that attitude.\"\n\n Samantha perks up slightly. \"See? That's the energy I wanted from you. Thank you, Jessica. You get it. You get me.\"\n\n Jessica smiles sweetly. \"I get that you're being ridiculous.\"\n\n \"Shut up,\" Samantha says, but there's no bite to her words.\n\n You glance over to the front of the store where Ash, the blue-haired employee, is currently trying to force a mannequin into a crop top. His focus is so intense you almost feel bad for returning everything.\n\n \"Come on,\" you say, motioning toward the exit. \"Let's get out of here before Ash adds me to a wall of shame.\"\n\n Samantha sighs, standing and dramatically trailing her fingers along the sleeve of a graphic tee. \"Goodbye, my sweet store. We could've had something beautiful.\"\n\n \"Stop being weird,\" you say automatically.\n\n \"Never,\" she replies with a grin, and somehow, you believe her.\n\n \n You step out of the fitting room with the clothes folded neatly over one arm, your hair slightly mussed and a strange lightness in your chest that you can't quite explain. Samantha is waiting just outside, leaning dramatically against a rack of crop tops like she's about to faint from hunger or boredom.\n\n The moment she sees you, she perks up. \"Sooooo? Spill. Did the butterfly speak to you? Did the guinea pigs whisper their secrets? Did the anime girl tell you to embrace chaos?\"\n\n You give her a look. \"It wasn't that deep.\"\n\n \"It was absolutely that deep,\" she insists. \"You decided to buy something. I can feel it. You have the face.\"\n\n \"The face?\" you repeat, raising a brow.\n\n \"The face of someone who has accepted the chaos and is ready to ascend,\" she says, dead serious before breaking into a grin. \"You did it. You actually did it!\"\n\n Jessica, who has been idly examining a rack of studded scrunchies, rolls her eyes. \"Ugh. Another one lost to skater culture.\"\n\n You glance at her. \"It's not skater culture.\"\n\n \"Uh, it's Threadz,\" Jessica fires back. \"That's literally their whole vibe.\"\n\n \"You take that back,\" Samantha says. \"This isn't just 'skater culture.' This is so much more than that.\"\n\n Jessica laughs, holding her hands up in surrender. \"Okay, okay, fair. I'm just saying that it's definitely a look.\" She steps closer, glancing at the tops tucked under your arm, her expression softening a little. \"But honestly? All that matters is that you like it. Wear whatever feels like you.\"\n\n \"See?\" Samantha says, jabbing a finger in Jessica's direction. \"She likes it. She's just being judgy for sport.\"\n\n Jessica rolls her eyes with a smile. \"I can't say you're entirely wrong.\"\n\n You shake your head, glancing between the two of them. \"I feel like I'm the prize in some weird fashion-themed custody battle.\"\n\n \"That's because you are,\" Samantha says, then grins. \"But at least you're a prize with better clothes now.\"\n\n You make your way to the front, where Ash nods solemnly at your selections. \"A fine haul. Let's get you cashed out.\"\n\n The register beeps as he scans your selections—though he doesn't comment on what you chose, only gives you a small, knowing smile like he gets it.\n\n \"That'll be—\" he pauses to tap a few buttons, \"a very reasonable number for the identity crisis you just resolved.\"\n\n You pull out your phone and tap it against the reader. The little ding of confirmation feels more satisfying than it should.\n\n Behind you, Samantha lets out a soft, triumphant \"yes\" under her breath.\n\n Ash hands you the bag. \"May these garments bring you emotional stability and drip.\"\n\n You blink. \"Thanks?\"\n\n \"Go forth and slay, or whatever people say nowadays,\" he says, then immediately trips over a lanyard on the floor and yells, \"I meant to do that.\"\n\n Jessica gives your shoulder a quick squeeze as you head toward the door. \"Different is good. That's how you figure out what really fits.\"\n\n \"Exactly!\" Samantha beams, smirking. \"My little fashion caterpillar is finally learning to crawl.\"\n\n \"Please don't call me that,\" you groan, but you can't help the small smile tugging at your mouth as they usher you back into the mall's buzz.\n \n\n \n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]\n\n \n [Choice: Now go to NovaTrend]",

You head toward the laundry room, where you can already hear the familiar rustling of folded towels and the occasional thunk of the basket being adjusted on top of the dryer.\n\nYour mom's standing there, sleeves pushed up, folding a warm pile of towels with practiced ease. There's a little smudge of something—probably flour—on her cheek from earlier, and her hair's tied up in a messy bun, a few strands curling loose at her temples.\n\nShe looks over when she hears your footsteps. \"Hey, sweetie. Need something?\"\n\nYou hesitate in the doorway for a second, then step inside and lean against the wall, watching her work. \"Kind of. I, uh... was thinking of going shopping.\"\n\nShe raises an eyebrow, folding the towel in her hands into a perfect rectangle. \"Shopping?\" There's a flicker of surprise in her voice, though not in a bad way. More like someone just heard a cat bark.\n\n\"Yeah,\" you say, rubbing the back of your neck. \"Like, for clothes. Stuff that fits better, maybe.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" Another towel joins the stack. \"Okay. And who's dragging you out for this mission?\"\n\nYou smile faintly. \"Samantha.\"\n\nAt that, your mom's face softens, her whole expression going a little warm around the edges. \"Samantha,\" she repeats, clearly pleased. \"Good. She's a smart one. Bit of a firecracker, but I like her. She tells it like it is.\"\n\n\"That's one way to put it,\" you mutter.\n\nYour mom chuckles, then reaches for her phone on the little shelf beside the detergent bottles. \"Well, I'm glad to hear it's her. Better her than Luke. He wore that shirt with the topless mermaid on it.\"\n\nYou wince. \"That was one time, and he didn't realize the mermaid's bra was see-through.\"\n\nMom doesn't respond, instead tapping on her phone.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" you ask, tilting your head.\n\n\"Giving you some money,\" she says, like it's the most obvious thing in the world. \"You shouldn't have to worry about that part.\"\n\nYou blink. \"Wait, really?\"\n\n\"Of course. You're growing—changing—and you deserve clothes that make you feel good in your skin. Besides, if you're brave enough to go shopping with Samantha, you deserve hazard pay.\"\n\nYou laugh, startled by how easily that warmth bubbles up in your chest.\n\nA second later, your phone buzzes in your pocket. You pull it out and check the screen: [100] transferred. She even put a note in the memo: For cool outfits and snacks. Don't blow it all on something weird.\n\n\"Wow.\" you say. \"Thanks, Mom.\"\n\nShe shrugs, tossing another folded towel onto the stack. \"You can pay me back by not leaving your dirty clothes on the floor for me to pick up.\"\n\n\"No promises.\"\n\nShe points a finger at you in warning, but she's smiling.\n\nYou start to back out of the room, still glancing at your phone like the number might vanish. [money] USD. That's the most you've had in your account in a while. Before you're fully in the hallway again, you pause. \"Hey, Mom?\"\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"Thanks. Really.\"\n\nShe doesn't look up from the laundry this time, just nods and says, \"Have fun. Be safe. And tell Samantha I said to keep you in one piece.\"\n\nYou grin. \"I'll try.\"\n\nAnd then you're off—up the stairs to your room, heart thudding with a strange mix of nerves and excitement. You've got plans. You've got funding. And in a few minutes, a whirlwind named Samantha is going to show up on your doorstep.\n\nYou'd better find socks without holes.\n\n[Choice: Whirlwind time]",

Not even in a way anyone else might notice. The air feels just a little different on your skin. The fabric of your shirt drapes differently. The world feels one inch closer.\n\nSamantha's waiting, her eyebrows lifted like she's reading you like a book in just one glance. She doesn't say anything right away. Just gives you a brief nod, a quiet kind of acknowledgement. Then, with a tilt of her head, she gestures toward the front of the store.\n\n\"Ready?\" she asks.\n\nYou nod once, and together, you walk down the softly lit store, past the racks of bras. Riley is back at the register, sorting some hangers, and she looks up when you approach. She smiles.\n\n\"Find what you liked?\" she asks, already reaching for the scanner.\n\nYou hand her the tag and the empty hanger. She scans them quickly, then pauses, tilting her head just slightly.\n\n\"You wearing it out?\" she asks.\n\nYou nod.\n\nShe nods back. She tucks the tag, the receipt, and the now-empty hanger into a little paper bag. The bag is soft pink, glossy, with a folded tissue paper top and a sticker seal with the store's logo.\n\nYou reach for your pocket, automatically, hand brushing your phone—only to be cut off by Samantha, who swoops in without ceremony.\n\n\"I've got it,\" she says, holding out her phone.\n\nYou blink. \"Wait—no, Samantha, I can—\"\n\nShe waves you off. \"Shush. It's a best friend gift. A milestone moment. You think I'm not gonna claim this emotional win?\"\n\n\"Samantha—\"\n\n\"Too late. I'm committing fraud if I have to. I'll personally destroy your financial independence if that's what it takes to buy your first bra.\"\n\nYou groan, but there's no stopping her. She taps her phone on the reader before you can argue further. Riley raises a brow, clearly amused, but says nothing as the terminal chimes and prints the receipt.\n\nSamantha takes the little pink bag and holds it like a trophy.\n\n\"First bra, first big moment. This is going in my mental scrapbook forever. You're lucky I didn't bring glitter.\"\n\nYou sigh, exasperated but not pushing the fight.\n\n\"You both take care, alright?\" Riley says, smiling again. \"Let me know if you ever need to try different fit or styles. There's no one-size-fits-all.\"\n\nYou offer a quiet thanks, not quite sure where to look, and Samantha gives Riley a parting salute.\n\nThen you step back out into the mall.\n\nNo one around you knows what happens, but you do.

Somewhere off in the distance, a child is begging for Nibblin' Nubs, and someone else's ringtone plays a muffled K-pop hook.\n\nSamantha stretches her arms overhead like she just finished a workout, rolling her shoulders dramatically. \"And that was step one in your glorious character arc,\" she declares. \"Now comes the fun part.\"\n\nYou glance over. \"That wasn't the fun part?\"\n\n\"Oh no. That was the emotionally meaningful part. Very 'soft piano plays in the background while the camera zooms in on your face.' This,\" she gestures to the buzzing mall ahead, \"is where we cue the upbeat music and the spinning clothing racks montage.\"\n\nYou can't help but laugh under your breath.\n\nShe turns on her heel and starts strolling forward, clearly expecting you to follow. \"Okay, options. We could hit up Blink + Shine if you want soft pastels and whispery cardigans that make you look like you live in a cottage.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"That's... specific.\"\n\nShe grins. \"I contain multitudes. Or—and this is my personal vote—we go to Threadz.\"\n\nYou already know the name. Threadz is the store with the posters of flaming stores and band logos plastered in the windows. Loud graphic tees. Chains. Jeans that come pre-ripped and distressed to a degree that feels like a cry for help. The mannequins look like they've just gotten back from yelling at their parents in 2007.\n\nSamantha glances back at you, walking backwards now with both hands in her pockets. \"Threadz has vibes, [name]. It's the spiritual home of sarcasm. It's chaos, caffeine, and making a fashion statement that's halfway between 'don't talk to me' and 'I quote Vine compilations like scripture.'\"\n\n\"Sounds subtle.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not,\" she beams. \"That's why it's perfect. Plus, they have shirts with raccoons wielding chainsaws and ones that just say NO in Comic Sans. We could find you something that says, 'I have opinions and snacks.'\"\n\nYou shake your head, but the corner of your mouth is already twitching.\n\nSamantha spins back around and starts steering toward the central area, where the mall splits off into three directions. She pauses there, one hand on her hip.\n\nNovaTrend is sleek and filled with plants, like a fashion blog brought to life. There are soft earth tones, cropped jackets, and baggy pants. Every display seems effortless yet curated.\n\nShatterBox has dark walls, racks of fishnets, studded belts, combat boots, and merchandise from bands you don't even recognize. Mesh sleeves and eyeliner are practically required.\n\nBlink + Shine is so sparkly it's practically vibrating. Hair clips, lip gloss, and enamel pins shaped like raccoons are on display.\n\nThreadz is wall-to-wall graphic tees, oversized hoodies, and anime designs. It smells faintly like body spray and rebellion.\n\nStepUp Footwear, a staple of the Crestview Bay mall, has so many shoes it nearly makes you dizzy.\n\nCuddle Creations has so many adorable stuffed animals that the cuteness might just overwhelm you.\n\n\"Alright, traveler,\" Samantha says. \"The road forks here.

It feels weirdly like coming full circle.\n\nSamantha drops onto a bench with a dramatic grunt, stretching her legs out like she's completed a marathon.\n\n\"Oh my God,\" she mutters, dragging one hand down her face. \"I'm dying, [name]. I'm wasting away. This is the end for me. Tell my story.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, glancing down at her sprawled posture. \"You spent most of that time waiting while I tried stuff on. You barely walked.\"\n\n\"I walked emotionally,\" she shoots back. \"I carried the weight of fashion judgment and spiritual support. That stuff burns calories, probably.\"\n\nYou can't help the small laugh that escapes you. \"Alright, fine. That's a fair point.\"\n\nShe flops her head to the side, eyes narrowing at a nearby churro stand like she might challenge it to a duel. \"I am so hungry I could eat an entire food court menu. And I mean everything. Even the cardboard pizza and weird smoothies.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" you say, gesturing vaguely toward the escalator, \"we could go to the food court?\"\n\nSamantha lifts her head slowly. \"Could we? Dare we? Will our weary legs carry us that far?\"\n\n\"You were just talking about having the strength to carry my emotional burdens.\"\n\n\"That was before the hunger,\" she deadpans. \"Now I have no more strength.\"\n\nYou grin, holding out your hand. \"Come on, my sarcastic friend. To the food court we go.\"\n\nShe takes your hand, standing up with a groan that's way more dramatic than necessary. \"Ugh. If I collapse on the way there, just roll me in the direction of carbs.\"\n\nYou both start walking, bags swaying gently, the sound of foot traffic growing louder as you move toward the distant scent of fried food. The pressure of decisions and dressing rooms have lifted. Now it's just you and Samantha, side by side, headed toward something simple.\n\n\"Okay,\" she says, adjusting her beanie and flicking a loose strand of hair out of her face. \"Food. Grease. Soda.

Eventually, you claim a two-seater near the middle—close enough to the restaurants, but not directly beneath the speakers blaring the latest hits at max volume. The table wobbles and the chairs are hard plastic. Classic mall ambiance.\n\nSamantha flops into her seat with all the flair of someone who has suffered greatly.

'Mostly small stuff,'\" she parrots, unimpressed. \"Righttt. And I 'mostly' don't order fries with my burger. That's what people say right before their card starts crying in the checkout line.\"\n\nYou hold up your phone, laughing. \"Technically, I didn't even pull out my card.\"\n\nShe gives you a disgusted look. \"Digital debt is still debt, you capitalist swine.\"\n\nYou open your mouth to respond, but she's already rummaging through her pocket—elbow deep in what seems to be an abyss of gum wrappers, old receipts, a hair tie that's definitely not hers, and finally, with a triumphant noise, she pulls out a wrinkled bill.\n\nShe slaps it on the table between you. \"There. That's all I've got. Treat yourself, queen.\"\n\nYou eye the bill. It's a ten. Maybe. You think. It looks like it's been through the laundry twice and a war once.\n\nSamantha leans back, crossing her arms behind her head like she's just solved all your problems. \"Go wild,\" she says, entirely deadpan. \"Buy yourself half a soda. Maybe a napkin if you're feeling decadent.\"\n\nYou snort, standing up and collecting the pitifully heroic crumpled note. \"You sure about this?\"\n\n\"Please,\" she says. \"You deserve it after surviving Blink + Shine and NovaTrend. Go get yourself some food.\"\n\nYou scan the nearby stalls, where a number of choices are spread out in front of you.\n\nPizza Hüt is a proud European chain that acts like putting an umlaut in the name makes their pizza cultured. The pizza's fine, but the crust is oddly sweet and the pepperoni looks like it was printed on. It's the kind of spot you eat at and then wonder if maybe you were just really hungry.\n\nLoud branding, flat burgers, and enough sauce to coat your soul. That's Burgur Kween. The combo deals are suspiciously cheap, and everything comes wrapped in foil with marketing slogans like \"SLAY THE CRAVE.\" It doesn't help the fact that their burgers look like they've been sat on, though.\n\nKansas Fried Poultry is the home of greasy chicken and coleslaw no one ever finishes. It was founded by General Thatch, whose portrait still hangs in every location—white suit, bolo tie, and a thousand-yard stare. They swear by their \"Legendary Eleven-Dust Blend™\"—you're pretty sure most of the taste comes down to the MSG though. No one knows what's in the gravy, but you eat it anyway. General Thatch would want you to be brave.\n\nTacko Bong is Tex-Mex, but barely. You order it because it smells good, then immediately question your decisions mid-bite. It's fast, cheap, and tastes decent going in. But let's be honest here—you know what happens next. There's a reason why every bathroom stall near a Tacko Bong is mysteriously out of order.\n\nKoala Express is an aggressively average Chinese fast-food chain that's somehow in every mall, airport, and food court, even though no one remembers it actually opening. The food is comforting in a suspiciously consistent way. The real mystery is the mascot: a grinning koala in a silk robe, holding chopsticks. No one knows why exactly an Australian marsupial is representing orange chicken, and the brand has never explained it. You're not here for the authenticity though—you're here because it smells good and hits the same way every time.\n\nWith the noble offering of Samantha's very tired money in your hand, you start to weigh your options.\n\n[Choice: Pizza Hüt]\n[Choice: Burgur Kween]\n[Choice: KFP - Kansas Fried Poultry]\n[Choice: Tacko Bong]\n[Choice: Koala Express]",

      "text": "You approach the glowing red sign of Pizza Hüt—\"Est. in Düsseldorf\" printed beneath it in proud serif font. It's like you're entering enemy territory. The whole stall has a certain... vibe. Cold efficiency. The staff wear crisp red aprons and stare at you like they've been trained in the harshest of kitchens.\n\n The guy at the counter is tall, severe, and looks like his soul was forged in a bread oven. His name tag just reads GÜNTER.\n\n \"Willkommen to ze Hüt,\" he says, with zero inflection. \"You vill be having ze pizza, ya?\"\n\n You blink. \"Uh... yeah. Just a slice of pepperoni—\"\n\n \"Peperoniwurst.\"\n\n He types something with aggressive precision.\n\n You look at the menu. It's technically in English, but every word has been rebranded into something that nears parody. Zauce, Krustenplatte, Mozarrella der Schmeltz. There's a combo meal called \"Die Trilogie der Käse.\" It's just a three-cheese pizza.\n \n \"What drink comes with it?\" you ask.\n\n He doesn't answer. He just slides you a room-temperature orange soda with the label peeled off. You're not convinced it's carbonated. Or legal.\n\n Five minutes later, your slice arrives in a little cardboard tray printed with the phrase \"Life ist kurz. Eat die Hüt.\" There's a parsley leaf on it.\n\n You carefully carry the tray back to the table. Samantha's got her legs kicked up on the chair next to her and is scrolling through her phone one-handed. She looks up when she sees the tray.\n\n \"That better not be from where I think it is.\"\n\n You set it down with a soft thud, the slice of pepperoni—sorry, Peperoniwurst—glistening under the lighting. \"Pizza Hüt,\" you announce solemnly. \"The Düsseldorf experience.\"\n\n Samantha lowers her phone slowly, eyeing the tray like it might explode. \"[name]. Be honest. Did they threaten you into buying that?\"\n\n You peel the soda can's mystery label back a little more and shrug. \"It felt like a negotiation with a foreign power. I didn't want to offend Günter.\"\n\n She sits up straighter. \"Günter?\"\n\n You nod, dead serious. \"Giant. Apron starched to hell. I think he was a general in the Great Carb War.\"\n\n You pick up your slice and inspect the lone parsley leaf clinging to the crust. \"They gave me this for presentation. I'm supposed to contemplate life while I chew, I think.\"\n\n \"Is that parsley?\" Samantha asks, leaning over and peering at your tray. \"On a mall pizza slice?\"\n\n You nod gravely. \"Life ist kurz. Eat die Hüt.\"\n\n That breaks her. She laughs loudly, smacking the table once with her palm. \"You did not just say that.\"\n\n You take a bite. The crust crunches like it's been reinforced with German engineering. \"Samantha, the crust is... structured,\" you say, chewing thoughtfully. \"The flavor profile is fear and obligation.\"\n\n Samantha fans herself with a napkin. \"You brave, tragic soul. Luke would've gone to Koala Express like a sane person.\"\n\n \"Luke's not here,\" you say, taking a sip of the soda. It takes like sadness and artificial orange.\n\n Samantha squints at the can. \"Why is it warm?\"\n\n \"It's like a rite of passage,\" you say, sighing. \"You wouldn't get it.\"\n\n She exhales slowly and shakes her head. \"[name]. One day you'll look back on this moment and realize it was a mistake to get Pizza Hüt.\"\n\n You grin at her through another bite. \"They didn't smile once. I respect that.\"\n\n \"You're just saying that because Günter still has your soul.\"\n\n And honestly? Maybe he does.\n\n \n The scent of flame-grilled something smacks you the moment you pass under the neon crown-shaped sign. Burgur Kween isn't quiet. The whole place radiates confidence, hot grease, and glittery chaos. Purple lights frame the menu board. The soda machine's blasting music. And the staff? They are living in the moment.\n\n Behind the counter stands a tall server with long acrylic nails, gold hoop earrings, and a perfectly tied apron that looks more like a fashion statement than a uniform. Their name tag reads \"Miss Patty\", in Sharpie, with a tiny lipstick kiss drawn next to it.\n\n \"Well hellooo, look who just stepped into the best restaurant in town, honey,\" they say, leaning dramatically on the counter. \"What's your vibe today? Feeling crunchy? Crispy? Or just extra?\"\n\n You blink. \"Um... just a cheeseburger?\"\n\n Miss Patty places one hand on their hip and gasps. \"Just a cheeseburger? Baby, no. We don't do 'just' here. We do bold, juicy, life-changing.\"\n\n Someone in the back yells, \"Drop a royal patty and crown it, darling!\"\n\n Patty turns back to you. \"That's for you, sweetness.\"\n\n You look up at the menu, which is a fever dream of specials with names like \"The Glam Stack,\" \"Double Drama,\" and \"The Untucked Combo.\" You order a single burger and fries, and Patty nods like you've chosen your house for the season.\n\n \"Ooh, a classic. Simple. Confident. I respect it. You don't need the extra sauce—you are the flavor.\"\n\n They slide your receipt across the counter with a wink. \"Grab a straw with attitude, not one of those flimsy basic ones.\"\n\n You return to the table with a tray that looks like it just walked off a stage. Even the burger is wrapped in paper that says \"SLAY ALL DAY\" in all caps with glitter-print ink. Samantha lowers her phone, blinks once, and stares at the tray.\n\n \"Did you just get back from a drag show or a fast food joint?\"\n\n You sit down slowly. \"Yes.\"\n\n \"Okay,\" Samantha says, blinking. \"Explain.\"\n\n You set down the tray with reverence. \"First of all, their soda machine has better music taste than half the school.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I can tell,\" Samantha says. \"I'm getting Beyoncé or Barbra Streisand from that thing. With a side of cardiac arrest, just to be safe.\"\n\n You peel the paper back from your burger, revealing a toasted bun and a suspiciously artful swirl of sauce. \"The person who took my order was named Miss Patty. She told me I was the flavor.\"\n\n \"...Of the burger?\"\n\n \"No. Of life.\"\n\n She leans back in her chair. \"What the hell is this mall, dude?\" she asks, mostly to herself.\n\n You take a bite and immediately taste a chaotic but harmonious symphony of grease and glamor. \"Honestly? She wasn't wrong.\"\n\n Samantha grabs one of your fries without asking and pops it into her mouth. She chews once, twice, then nods. \"Okay, I have to admit that it's criminally good.\"\n\n You reach into the bag and retrieve a paper crown, holding it up like an offering. \"They gave me this.\"\n\n She looks at it. Then at you.\n\n \"[name]. If you put that on your head, I will call you the Burgur Prince for the rest of the day.\"\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You raise your eyebrows, hovering the crown an inch above your hair. \"What if I want to be the Burgur Princess?\"\n\n Samantha places a hand over her heart. \"Then I'll know that I've truly lost you to the glitter.\"\n \n \n You raise your eyebrows, hovering the crown an inch above your hair. \"What if I wear this, but only ironically?\"\n\n Samantha sighs. \"It doesn't work like that, dude.\"\n \n\n You grin and set the crown aside—for now. Instead, you grab your cup and raise it. \"To Miss Patty.\"\n\n Samantha smiles. \"To the Kween.\"\n\n \n The smell hits you before the sign does—grease, salt, black pepper, and a kind of smoky defiance that makes it clear you didn't come here to be healthy.\n\n Kansas Fried Poultry squats in the corner of the food court like it owns the mall. The logo's just a silhouette of the state of Kansas wearing a cowboy hat, and the man behind the myth—General Thatch—is everywhere. His framed portrait hangs behind the counter, squinting like he's seen combat and invented cornbread in the same week. His statue holds a chicken drumstick like it's the Declaration of Independence. There's even a tattered American flag above the counter.\n\n The counter girl's leanin' on the register like it owes her money. Her faded name tag just says Mary-Beth and her apron's got cornbread batter scars.\n\n \"Well, hey there, sugar,\" she drawls, voice slow as sweet tea left out in August. \"You look like somebody with a deep hunger and questionable judgment. Lemme fix that fer ya.\"\n\n You open your mouth to ask a question, but she's already shaking her head.\n\n \"Nuh uh. We don't do menus. We do chicken. Hot, proud, and real enough to bring a tear to your meemaw's eye.\"\n\n She turns and bellows into the back without looking. \"Drop two thighs in the fire! And throw a mercy biscuit in there too, bless their heart!\"\n\n She slaps a bucket on the counter with a thud that feels spiritual.\n\n \"Y'all enjoy now,\" Mary-Beth says, wiping her hands on a rag that might've fought in the war. \"And if it don't light a fire in yer chest, we'll bury ya with honor.\"\n\n You carry it back to the table like it's holy.\n\n Samantha glances up from her phone, sniffing dramatically. \"Oh my God. Did you just get back from a soul food joint?\"\n\n You set the bucket down and ease into the seat. \"She called me sugar. Then insulted my life choices. Then fed me.\"\n\n \"What did you even order?\" Samantha asks, eyes narrowing.\n\n \"There is no order,\" you say solemnly, lifting the lid. A wave of steam and judgment rolls out. \"You just receive.\"\n\n You pick up a thigh and bite into it. The skin shatters audibly, and a spice strong enough to make you hallucinate hits you square in the chest. \"This tastes like patriotism and generational trauma.\"\n\n \"General Thatch would be proud,\" Samantha says, nodding. \"Look at you, living the full poultry experience.\"\n\n You raise your biscuit, warm, crumbly, and held together by butter and prayer. \"For the record, I did not ask for this biscuit. It was given to me out of pity.\"\n\n \"Honestly? I've got to respect that. That's southern hospitality. Feed first, ask questions never.\"\n\n You nod solemnly. \"I think I have a meemaw now.\"\n\n \"Bless your heart,\" Samantha says, biting back a grin. \"And your arteries.\"\n\n \n The closer you get to Tacko Bong, the more it smells like a college dorm microwave and the inside of a tortilla chip bag. Not bad, necessarily—just chaotic. There's a faded mural on the wall of a cactus wearing sunglasses and a beanie, holding a burrito like it's the Holy Grail. A little sign on the register reads: \"Now Hiring. No Snitches.\"\n\n The guy behind the counter has half-lidded eyes and a name tag that says \"Chaz\", drawn in Sharpie. He's got a bandana tied around his head and a string of hot sauce pockets clipped to his belt like ammo.\n\n He stares at you for a long second after you approach. Almost as if he's buffering.\n\n \"...Yo,\" he says finally. \"You, uh... hungry?\"\n\n You nod.\n\n He nods too.\n\n \"That's sick. Me too, man.\"\n\n There's no real menu—just a few laminated photos taped crookedly to the sneeze guard. Cruncho Loco Supreme, Nacho Nacho Situation, and the Mystery Quesadilla (No Refunds).\n\n \"I can, like... throw some stuff in a tortilla?\" Chaz offers. \"We got beans. Probably.\"\n\n A second guy appears from the back. You didn't hear him come out. His name tag says \"Spoon\", and he's holding a ladle full of neon-yellow cheese like it's a sacred artifact.\n\n \"Dude, you want the drip?\" he asks. \"We got the drip.\"\n\n You pause. \"What exactly is the drip?\"\n\n He gestures at the ladle. \"This. This is the drip.\"\n\n Chaz nods solemnly behind him, \"It's, like, spiritual.\"\n\n You order something that sounds vaguely like a taco, hand over the cash, and watch as they begin to construct your meal with an intense focus. There's a lot of unlabelled containers. You choose not to ask.\n\n Minutes later, you're handed a loosely wrapped bundle of tortilla, heat, and vibes. It drips. You're not sure what. But it drips.\n\n You return to the table holding your food carefully. The wrapper is already translucent from whatever's inside it—steam curling upward like it's trying to escape. It smells like melted cheese and danger.\n\n Samantha eyes the bundle warily as you set it down. \"Jesus. That thing looks like it's been through a spiritual journey.\"\n\n \"The guy who made it had a name tag that just said 'Spoon,'\" you say, sitting down carefully. \"He didn't blink once.\"\n\n \"Spoon?\" Samantha asks, tilting her head.\n\n You nod solemnly. \"He asked if I wanted 'the drip.' And when I asked what that meant, he held up a ladle of neon cheese.\"\n\n She stares. \"...And you still said yes?\"\n\n \"Well, I was already too deep,\" you respond, shrugging. \"Chaz behind the counter had a hot sauce belt. I couldn't walk away after that.\"\n\n Samantha leans back in her chair. \"We're losing you,\" she says mournfully.\n\n You unwrap the thing—some mutant combo of taco and burrito, sagging at the seams and oozing something viscous. There's a weird crunch in the middle, which you choose not to investigate.\n\n \"I don't even know what I ordered,\" you admit.\n\n \"Yeah, it shows.\"\n\n You take a bite. It's hot, creamy, spicy, and possibly illegal in three states. The cheese drips onto your tray.\n\n You glance up at her mid-chew. \"It's actually pretty good.\"\n\n \"Please let my friend's intestines survive the next few days,\" Samantha says, clasping her hands and pretending to pray.\n\n You don't respond. You're too busy chasing whatever that last flavor was—you can't tell if it was lime or battery acid.\n\n All you know is that it burns, and you're strangely okay with that.\n\n \n You spot the waving golden cat before anything else—perched proudly on the counter of Koala Express, its paw moving in slow, hypnotic arcs like it knows something you don't.\n\n The menu board glows red and gold, slick with laminated sheen, listing a staggering number of combos and sides. Every single one comes with two entrées and a side. The trays are already stacked, wide enough to double as life rafts.\n\n The server behind the counter doesn't look up as she greets you. \"Hi, welcome to Koala Express. Do you want a combo or box today?\"\n\n You glance down at the steam table. There's orange chicken glistening like a sunset, beef and broccoli soaking in sauce, and fried rice piled so high it's got elevation. Everything smells like soy sauce and sugar.\n\n \"A combo?\" you offer.\n\n \"Good choice. Two entrées, one side. Orange chicken?\" She's already spooning it into your tray before you nod.\n\n You pick a second dish. It doesn't really matter what you choose, they all look like they've been prepared by someone who knows what your soul needs and doesn't believe in small portions. The food is heaped on like gravity's on break. By the time she finishes adding a scoop of chow mein, your tray weighs more than your dignity.\n\n She throws in a crushed fortune cookie and an extra packet of soy sauce for \"flavor insurance.\" Then comes the plastic lid, taped shut with serious intent. It barely fits. You nod your thanks, hand sinking under the weight as you turn to head back.\n\n You return to the table like a weary traveler dragging home his spoils, the Koala Express tray balanced in your hands like a brick of hot, edible treasure. The lid is puffed up like it's trying to escape the contents, held together by one brave piece of tape and sheer determination.\n\n Samantha raises an eyebrow as you set it down with a heavy thud. The table actually rattles.\n\n \"Oh my God,\" she says, eyes widening. \"Did they just give you the entire restaurant?\"\n\n You take a seat. \"It's... a combo meal.\"\n\n She leans forward, inspecting the tray like it's some kind of anomaly. \"That's not a combo. That's a geological formation. Is that rice? Or did they just scoop up a beach and hope for the best?\"\n\n You touch the tape, and the lid immediately opens with a sad pop. Steam floods the air instantly, carrying the scent of fried goodness and sweet glaze. Orange chicken glistens in one corner like molten sugar lava, the chow mein is tangled into a knot, and the beef is oozing.\n\n \"I'm not sure if this is food or a challenge,\" you murmur, picking up a fork that already feels too flimsy for the job.\n\n Samantha makes a face. \"They give you a shovel, or...?\"\n\n You reach for the fortune cookie. The cookie cracks and you fish out the fortune. You read it aloud:\n You are full of potential. And also rice.\n\n You nod, like it's a prophecy.\n\n Time to eat.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

She slumps into her seat across from you, shoving her sleeves up like she's preparing for combat.\n\n\"Alright,\" she says, cracking open a pair of wooden chopsticks with an unnecessarily dramatic snap. \"Let's get this over with before one of us passes out from too much salt exposure.\"\n\nYou dig into your own food, chewing thoughtfully. It's not bad. The food court stuff rarely is, even if it probably comes with microplastics.\n\nSamantha jabs a piece of something battered and deep-fried, lifting it suspiciously. \"You ever think about how this stuff probably started frozen in a truck somewhere in, like, Nevada? And now it's in California, coated in mystery sauce and about to become part of my soul.\"\n\n\"It's called the circle of life,\" you say, shrugging.\n\n\"More like the circle of processed food and poor decisions,\" she responds, snorting. \"Simba would weep.\"\n\nYou both eat in comfortable silence for a moment, the muffled sounds of mall ambiance washing over your table—people chatting, trays sliding, the faint warble of whatever Billboard Top 100 song is being piped through the speakers. You sneak a glance at Samantha. She's hunched a little over her tray, chewing intently, her usual sarcastic air still intact but softened by the fact that she's clearly starving.\n\nShe catches you staring and pauses, mid-bite. \"What?\" she asks, mouth half full. \"Do I have sauce on my face or something?\"\n\n\"No,\" you say, shaking your head. \"It's just that you kinda eat like a raccoon.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" she beams. \"That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. I try to bring a certain chaos to the table.\"\n\nA beat passes, and her expression shifts just slightly. There's something behind the humor now—a certain sense of real warmth.\n\n\"You did good today, by the way,\" she says, quieter now. \"With all the shopping and trying stuff on and not bolting for the exits. I know this kind of thing's not always easy.\"\n\nYou blink. \"Thanks.\"\n\nShe shrugs like it's no big deal, but her eyes stay on you for a few seconds longer than usual before she turns back to her tray.\n\n\"Don't get used to me being nice, though,\" she mutters. \"I've got a reputation to maintain.\"\n\nYou grin and take another bite, heart a little lighter.\n\n[Choice: Be genuine]\n[Choice: Be teasing]\n[Choice: Be flirty]",

      "text": "Samantha's halfway through chewing something when you glance over at her, and for once, you don't have a joke lined up or a comeback waiting to pounce. You just look at her—really look. At the way she slouches in her chair like she owns the whole food court, one sneaker kicked out under the table. The way her beanie's tilted slightly back, letting a few strands of hair fall messily against her forehead. The way she picks through her french fries like she's searching for the ones with the most structural integrity.\n\n You lean forward a little, nudging your tray aside. \"Hey.\"\n\n She glances up, mid-bite. \"Hmm?\"\n\n \"I just... wanted to say thanks.\"\n\n Her chewing slows.\n\n \"For coming today, I mean,\" you add, suddenly aware of how warm your ears feel. \"I know malls aren't exactly your thing, and I kind of dragged you around forever. But you stuck around, and that means a lot.\"\n\n She blinks, surprised—like you just started speaking fluent Klingon. \"Oh,\" she says, and it's the softest sound you've heard from her all day. \"That's, uh...\"\n\n You half-expect her to ruin the moment with a sarcastic quip, but she doesn't. Instead, she sets down her food, her expression unreadable for a moment. Then her lips curl into a soft smile.\n\n \"I mean... yeah. Of course I did.\" She shrugs like it's no big deal. \"You're my best friend. That's kind of what we do. Be there. Even when your taste in stores is questionable at best.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath. \"Hey, some of the stuff I bought is cool.\"\n\n \"I'm reserving judgment until I see you wear it outside of the mall,\" she says. But her voice is lighter now, and there's something warm in her eyes.\n\n There's a brief pause between you, filled only by the ambiance of the food court.\n\n Then Samantha leans back in her seat, picks up a fry, and points it at you like a wand. \"Alright, that's enough fluff for one day. Any more of this and I'll spontaneously combust into a ball of feelings.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but you're smiling.\n\n \n Samantha's halfway through stuffing a fry in her mouth when you cock your head and squint at her like you've just noticed something heinous.\n\n \"What?\" she says, instantly suspicious, her mouth half-full. \"Why are you looking at me like that? Don't do that. That's your 'I'm about to say something dumb' face.\"\n\n You lean your chin on your hand, eyes twinkling. \"Just wondering how it feels to have sauce all over your face in public.\"\n\n She freezes. \"What?! Where—\" She grabs a napkin with enough force to crumple it and starts scrubbing at her cheek like her life depends on it.\n\n You keep your expression perfectly innocent.\n\n She wipes harder. \"Which side is it on?\"\n\n \"Both.\"\n\n She stops. Squints at you. Then narrows her eyes. \"There's nothing on my face, is there.\"\n\n \"Nope,\" you say, smiling sweetly. \"Not a thing.\"\n\n Samantha glares. \"I'm going to end you.\"\n\n \"You'll have to catch me first.\"\n\n \"Oh, I will,\" she says, dramatically wagging a fry in your direction like it's a knife. \"When you least expect it, I'll strike in the dead of night, all because you decided to pull a fake sauce emergency.\"\n\n \"I accept my fate,\" you reply solemnly. \"But I regret nothing.\"\n\n \"You should regret everything,\" she mutters, then flicks the fry at you. It lazily bounces off your shoulder and lands with a sad plop on your tray.\n\n You both crack up.\n\n \n \n \n \n You lean back just slightly, tilting your head like you're examining something crucial. Samantha pauses, immediately suspicious. \"What now?\" she asks, voice halfway between annoyed and wary.\n\n You give her a smile. \"You've got something on your cheek.\"\n\n \"Where?\" she asks, raising an eyebrow.\n\n \"There,\" you say, gesturing vaguely. \"Little bit of sauce.\"\n\n She starts to lift her hand to wipe it off, but you're already leaning in. \"Here, let me get it,\" you say.\n\n There's a second—just one—where the air shifts. You don't normally volunteer to touch her face. That's never been your thing. Samantha's not the delicate type, not someone who gets doted on. You both know that.\n\n So when you gently reach out and brush your thumb across her cheek—right where there is absolutely no sauce—her whole body goes still.\n\n The touch is soft and intentional. Your thumb lingers longer than it needs to, a warm press of contact that says more than you could ever phrase out loud. She blinks, watching you carefully, and for a split moment, her usual sarcasm falters.\n\n \"...You liar,\" she says, but she's not mad. Not even annoyed. Just stunned and a little breathless. \"There was no sauce, was there?\"\n\n You give a tiny shrug. \"Guess you'll never know.\"\n\n She stares at you, blinking once. Then slowly, a smile curls across her face—small, a little crooked, but real. \"Oh my God, [name],\" she murmurs, shaking her head like she can't believe you just did that. \"I think I hate you.\"\n\n \"You're welcome,\" you say, your voice a little softer now. You scoot your chair forward and let the moment settle between you.\n\n She doesn't move away.\n\n You both return to your food, but something's changed. It's quiet, not uncomfortable—just charged in a way that didn't exist five minutes ago. A new thread has been pulled between you. It's invisible, sure, but unmistakable.\n\n Samantha pokes at her food, side-eyeing you without really looking. \"Next time you lie, at least commit to it. You missed the other cheek.\"\n\n You grin. \"Oh, I'll get it next time.\"\n\n She rolls her eyes, but there's a flush on her ears that she absolutely does not address. And for once, she doesn't say anything sarcastic to follow it up.\n\n You both keep eating—but your knees touch under the table now, and neither of you moves.\n \n\n[Choice: Finish eating]",

      "text": "You lean back in your seat, tray mostly empty, that pleasant kind of full settling into your stomach. It's the quiet lull after a good meal—the kind where you're ready to melt into your chair and not move for a solid week. Samantha wipes her hands on a napkin, crumples it into a little ball, and arcs it toward a nearby trash bin. It bounces off the rim and flutters to the floor.\n\n\"Tragic,\" she says flatly.\n\nYou smirk. \"That was pathetic.\"\n\n\"Excuse you,\" she replies, eyes narrowing. \"That was graceful and daring. It's just that the trash can wasn't ready for my level of artistry.\"\n\nYou stretch your arms over your head, feeling the weight of the day beginning to settle into your shoulders. \"We finally done here?\"\n\n\"What do you mean 'done'?\" she asks, arching a brow. \"We're not even at the final boss.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nShe slaps her hands on the table. \"Dessert, [name].\"\n\nYou blink.\n\n\"We just ate.\"\n\n\"And now we eat again,\" she says solemnly, like it's a sacred rite. \"Ice cream, dude. The universe demands balance.\"\n\nYou squint at her. \"Since when were you the ice cream fan?\"\n\n\"Since always,\" she says, standing up. \"Look, I survived multiple hours of NovaTrend, three near-death dressing room experiences, and the emotional whiplash of watching you become one with femininity. I need this.\"\n\nYou shake your head, laughing under your breath. \"You are so dramatic.\"\n\n\"And you're lucky I am,\" she shoot back, grabbing her tray to toss it. \"Otherwise you'd never leave your cave and experience joy.\"\n\nWith a helpless shrug, you decide to follow her. \"Fine, fine. Ice cream it is.\"\n\n\"That's the spirit,\" she says. \"Come, brave hero. Let us indulge in sugar and dairy.\"\n\nYou walk side by side, weaving through the afternoon crowd. The food court buzzes behind you as you head toward the local ice cream parlor. The smell of waffle cones and vanilla hits first—sweet and warm, with that distinct promise of a sugar rush.\n\nSamantha slows as you approach the counter, taking in the display case. \"Okay,\" she mutters to herself. \"Do I want something classic? Or chaotic? Do I dare mix the cookie dough with the cotton candy again?\"\n\n\"Didn't that give you a stomachache last time?\" you ask.\n\n\"Yes,\" she says gravely. \"And I learned nothing.\"\n\nYou step forward as the server behind the counter glances up with a smile, ready to take your order.\n\n \n You glance over the rows of colorful options, each more swirled and sprinkled and unique than the last... and go for vanilla.\n\n Classic. Safe. Uncontroversial.\n\n The moment the scoop hits the cone, Samantha lets out a slow, theatrical exhale.\n\n \"Vanilla?\" she says, eyebrows climbing. \"Really, [name]? In a place that sells 'Cereal Killer Crunch' and 'Unicorn Tears Surprise,' you picked vanilla?\"\n\n You shrug. \"It's good.\"\n\n \"Yeah, so is water,\" she mutters. \"And that has no personality.\"\n\n \"I happen to like water,\" you reply, grinning.\n\n \"Yeah, well, I happen to like having a best friend who doesn't like water and vanilla ice cream, but we can't all win.\"\n\n \n You don't hesitate. One scoop of rich chocolate, no frills. Reliable and an easy win.\n\n Samantha raises an eyebrow. \"Chocolate, huh?\" she says, giving a small nod. @.samantha;\"Can't go wrong with chocolate.\"@@\n\n \"Did you just... approve of my choice?\" you ask.\n\n \"No, of course not,\" she responds, clearly holding back a smirk. \"Just very... childish.\"\n\n You look at her flatly. \"It's chocolate. Everyone likes it.\"\n\n \"And that's the problem,\" she says. \"It's too safe.\"\n\n \"I'm the one with the ice cream, you're the one with opinions,\" you respond.\n\n \"Hey, I never said it was a bad pick,\" Samantha says.\n\n \n You lean forward and point decisively. \"Cookies and cream, please.\"\n\n The worker nods and scoops you a generous swirl, speckled with crumbled cookie bits. Just the right amount of crunch and cream.\n\n Samantha watches it and hums approvingly. \"Ah, yes. The indecisive person's favorite. 'I want cookies, but also... milk? but cold. But frozen. But not too adult.'\"\n\n You blink. \"I don't think of all that. It's just good.\"\n\n \"Exactly, it's too good,\" Samantha says, like she's making some great point. \"Everyone likes it. That's what makes me suspicious.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Are you seriously gatekeeping ice cream right now?\"\n\n \"Yes,\" she says solemnly. \"I'm morally obligated.\"\n\n \n You point to the strawberry. It's pale pink with little bits of fruit tucked inside.\n\n Sure enough, Samantha glances over and raises both brows. \"Strawberry?\"\n\n \"What?\" you say, taking a bite. \"It's good.\"\n\n \"Oh, I'm not judging,\" she says, sliding her hands into her pockets. \"It's just kinda sweet. Unexpected.\"\n\n \"Am I not sweet?\" you ask.\n\n She laughs under her breath. \"Let's not get into that.\"\n \n\nSamantha stares down the row of ice cream tubs with her arms crossed. Her weight is shifted to one hip and her lips are pursed.\n\n\"No,\" she mutters at mint chip. \"Too toothpaste. No,\" again at rainbow sherbet. \"Not eating something that looks like it was sneezed out by a unicorn.\"\n\n\"Want some privacy?\" you ask, deadpan.\n\nShe shoots you a glare, then points at a tub toward the end. \"That one, please. Triple Fudge Frenzy. It speaks to me.\"\n\nThe worker gives her a nod and starts scooping.\n\nYou both move toward the checkout counter. When you make your way there, Samantha turns and stares wordlessly at the pile of shopping bags looped around your arm and cradled against your hip. Her gaze travels from the patterned handles to the glossy branded logos. Her eyes narrows. Her expression goes blank.\n\nYou don't even need to say it.\n\n\"I—\" you start.\n\nShe cuts you off with a heavy sigh, like she's just aged five years. \"[name]. My sweet, dumb shopping casualty. Do you have any money left?\"\n\n\"I have emotional gratitude,\" you say, shrugging sheepishly.\n\n\"That won't pay for dairy, buddy.\"\n\nStill grumbling, she pulls her phone out and taps it against the reader before you can argue. A chime sounds, confirming the payment.\n\n\"Thanks,\" you murmur, already guilty.\n\nShe hands you your cone like she's bestowing you with a cursed heirloom. \"You owe me.\"\n\n\"Fair,\" you reply, nodding solemnly.\n\n\"No, like—you seriously owe me,\" she continues, pointing a dramatic finger at your face. \"Next time we pass a store that sells squishmallows, you're buying me the dumbest, biggest, ugliest one they have. I want it to ruin my bed aesthetic.\"\n\n\"You know what?\" you say, laughing. \"Deal.\"\n\nWith cones in hand, the two of you shuffle over to a nearby bench that's somehow both sticky and cold at the same time. You manage to arrange your shopping bags on the floor then settle in beside her. Somehow, Samantha's already halfway into her cone.\n\n\"So,\" she says, licking fudge off her thumb. \"Now that you've bankrupted yourself and expanded your wardrobe... what do we talk about?\"\n\n[Choice: Say that you might think she likes you if she keeps spoiling you]\n[Choice: Thank her for coming with you]",

She's almost done with her cone now, one leg kicked out under the seat and sleeves pushed up. She catches you looking and raises a brow.\n\n You wait a beat, savoring the moment, and then say it casually, \"You know, if you keep spoiling me like this... I might start thinking you've got a crush on me.\"\n\n Her reaction is immediate. She chokes slightly on her bite of ice cream, making a face like it was the cone's fault and not the sentence you just dropped on her. \"Oh my God, [name],\" she mutters, squinting at you like she's trying to shoot a laser through your soul with sarcasm alone. \"You're insufferable.\"\n\n But there's color rising to her cheeks. Faint, sure, but there. You don't press—it's already enough to know you hit something.\n\n \"I spoil you?\" she says, trying to regain control. \"Dude, you bought out half the mall. I paid for your bra, food, and ice cream out of kindness because you were broke.\"\n\n You grin, tilting your head. \"So you're saying you care.'\n\n \"I'm saying I saw your remaining balance.\" She narrows her eyes, still playing defense—but her voice does soften just a little. \"And, maybe, that it's kind of nice seeing you actually enjoy something.\"\n\n That last bit hangs in the air for a moment longer than necessary. Her tone doesn't change much, but there's something underneath it. She won't say it directly—she never does—but her foot brushes yours under the table, just barely. Not enough for her to admit it, but enough that it happened.\n\n You go back to your cone, pretending you didn't notice. She does the same.\n\n \"I mean, let's not get ahead of ourselves,\" she adds quickly. \"I'm still emotionally processing the fact that you willingly tried on a skirt. I need, like, a week to recalibrate.\"\n\n You laugh. \"You'll survive.\"\n\n \"I better,\" she mutters, then glances at you sidelong. \"But for the record... if I did have a crush on you, which I don't, you'd never see it coming. I'd be way cooler about it.\"\n\n You give her a look. \"This is you being cool?\"\n\n She licks her cone with theatrical indifference. \"I am the pinnacle of cool.\"\n\n And beneath all of her sarcasm and snark, you can feel it. Something in the way she smiles, in the way she keeps looking at you even after she pretends to look away. Something shifting. Something real.\n\n \n \n You glance over at Samantha and start speaking before you can overthink it.\n\n \"Hey,\" you begin, voice soft. \"Thanks for coming with me today. I probably would've chickened out if I'd come alone.\"\n\n Samantha freezes mid-bite of her ice cream and lowers it slowly, brows raised like she wasn't expecting anything even remotely sincere from you.\n\n \"I'm glad I came too,\" she says, tone softening into something real. \"it was kinda fun watching you panic over hair ties and pastel hoodies.\"\n\n You groan. \"That wasn't panic, Samantha. It was more like... fashion-driven dread.\"\n\n \"Oh, my bad,\" she deadpans. \"I forgot you're a tortured artist.\"\n\n But then she taps your shoes with hers under the table. It's a small gesture, but familiar. \"Look—all jokes aside? I'd come with you again. Anytime. Even if I have to drag your indecisive ass through a million more stores.\"\n\n You glance at her, heart doing something dumb in your chest. Not in a romantic way—you don't see her like that—just in that way it does when you know you've got someone who shows up. Who gets you. Who's stayed by your side for years.\n\n \"Yeah?\" you say.\n\n She nods, then raises her cone like a toast. \"To certified best friend duty. I'm on call 24/7. Terms and conditions apply.\"\n\n You snort, clinking your cone against hers with an exaggerated \"cheers.\"\n\n She leans back with a sigh, wiping a dab of ice cream from her wrist with a napkin. \"Today was a good day, [name].\"\n\n \"Very much so,\" you respond.\n\n She grins, and the conversation drifts back to lighter things. But the moment stays there between you, and you know you'll come back to it later.\n \n\n[Choice: Time to go back home]",

The sky's gone black, the streetlights are on, and the breeze that hits you is cooler now. The parking lot's half-empty, the buzz of cars replaced by the sounds of nature.\n\nSamantha stops just outside the entrance, blinking like she's only just realized what time it is.\n\n\"Dude,\" she says. \"It's night. Like, actual night. When the hell did that happen?\"\n\nYou glance at the sky. \"Uh... somewhere between the third and fourth store we visited?\"\n\nShe pulls out her phone, checks the time, and groans. \"Oh my God, [name]. We were in there for hours. No wonder my legs feel like I ran a marathon.\"\n\nShe opens a taxi app out of instinct, her thumb already tapping through the motions before her brain can catch up. The app loads with a cheerful little chime, casting a yellow glow across her face as she squints at the screen. Her expression is hopeful for maybe half a second.\n\nThen the price appears.\n\nHer eyebrows shoot up. \"Forty bucks? For a mile?\"\n\nYou glance over just in time to see her jaw fall slack, like the phone just personally insulted her. \"Does the driver hand-feed you grapes and whisper affirmations the whole ride, or...?\"\n\nShe shows you the screen. You don't have to look at anything other than the big number to feel your wallet clench in sympathy. \"That better come with a solid gold seatbelt.\"\n\n\"Right?\" Samantha swipes the app away with a dramatic flourish and a disgusted scoff. \"Nope. Absolutely not. I am not paying forty fucking dollars to be chauffeured by some guy who smells like body odor and cigarettes.\"\n\nYou snort, adjusting the shopping bags in your arms. They're heavier now—or maybe your arms are just finally feeling it.\n\nSamantha pockets her phone and stretches. \"Guess I'm walking.\"\n\nThen she turns to see you.\n\nMore specifically, she turns to see the mountain of pastel and branded bags you're currently carrying, stacked on your arms. One bag has glitter on it. Another is suspiciously crinkly. You look like a stylish pack mule.\n\nSamantha stares. Then blinks. Then slowly, slowly, exhales.\n\n\"Oh, come on.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" you start, trying to rearrange the weight. \"I can carry them.\"\n\n\"You'll drop one,\" she says flatly. \"Probably into a storm drain. Then I'll have to leap in after it and get eaten by a killer clown.\"\n\nYou shrug. \"That's kind of on-brand for you.\"\n\nShe mutters something under her breath, but steps forward and plucks two of the heavier bags out of your arms anyway.\n\n\"I swear,\" she says, \"this friendship is gonna be the end of me.\"\n\nYou grin. \"Thanks.\"\n\nShe rolls her eyes and jerks her chin toward the sidewalk. \"Let's go before I change my mind and throw your new clothes into traffic.\"\n\nYou fall into step beside her, the two of you walking.

Her hair's still covered under her beanie, a little messy from the breeze, and there's a grin stretched wide across her face.\n\n\"Behold!\" she announces, arms thrown wide like a magician. \"Your fairy godmother has arrived. I bring fashion advice, emotional damage, and possibly foot blisters.\"\n\nYou grin. \"You walked?\"\n\n\"Of course I walked. What am I, a coward?\" she says, pushing past you into the entryway. \"I am committed to the cause and to cardio. Also, I don't have a car.\"\n\nYou laugh, shutting the door behind her.

Either way, by the time your neighborhood finally comes into view—quiet, familiar, and dimly lit—it feels like you've both just returned from war.\n\n\"Okay,\" Samantha pants, her breath visible in the cool air. \"I'm just saying, I hope whatever god cursed humanity with two arms instead of four is really enjoying this.\"\n\nYou grunt, adjusting the handles of your bags where they dig into your fingers. \"We did fine.\"\n\nShe looks over at you, one eyebrow arched. \"You bought a ton of things. I carried, like, half. I'm not even mad, but I do want you to know I expect compensation. Preferably in the form of back massages or eternal gratitude.\"\n\n\"Noted,\" you say, huffing a laugh.\n\nThe porch comes into view—home, finally. The warm light spilling from the front window feels especially welcoming after the long walk, and you trudge up the steps with what little energy you have left. Unfortunately, with both your arms full of bags, there's no way you can reach for your keys.\n\n\"Uh,\" you say, shifting your weight awkwardly.\n\nSamantha watches you struggle for a beat. Then she steps up beside you and deadpans, \"Shall I knock using my mind powers or...?\"\n\n\"I'm ringing the bell,\" you mutter, tilting sideways just enough to jab your elbow against the doorbell.\n\nThe sound of the chime inside is followed by the soft shuffle of footsteps, and a second later, the door swings open to reveal your mom. She blinks at you, surprised—then breaks into a smile.\n\n\"Oh my gosh,\" she says, her eyes widening. \"What happened to just looking?\"\n\nYou glance down at the mountain of bags hanging off your wrists. \"Uh... We looked. Then we looked harder.\"\n\nYour mom laughs, the sound light and warm. \"Well, it looks like you had fun.\"\n\nShe spots Samantha behind you, her own arms loaded down with a few of your larger bags. Her expression softens even more.\n\n\"Samantha,\" your mom says, stepping aside to hold the door open. \"You are such a good friend. Thank you for sticking with him all day.\"\n\nSamantha gives a grin, puts down the bags, and offers a quick salute. \"Someone had to be the voice of reason. Not that he bothered to listen.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he appreciated it anyway,\" your mom says with a wink. Then she gestures into the house. \"You're welcome to come in, by the way. We've got tea, or soda, or I could make some eggs—\"\n\nSamantha waves a hand, stepping back onto the porch. \"I'd better head home before my legs give out completely. Also, I'm like, 99% sure if I sit down, I'm never getting back up.\"\n\nYour mom nods, but you can see a glint of concern in her eyes. She disappears into the kitchen for all of five seconds and returns with a chilled plastic water bottle, condensation dripping down the sides.\n\n\"Well, at least take this,\" she insists, pressing it into Samantha's hand. \"You've earned it.\"\n\nSamantha blinks at the bottle, then snorts. \"Thanks, Mrs. Yoon. Hydration is the final boss of today.\"\n\n\"Text me when you get home?\" you say.\n\n\"Will do,\" she says, taking a step back down the porch. \"Assuming my arms still function by then.\"\n\nYour mom leans against the doorframe, smiling fondly. \"Be safe walking, okay?

I'm pretty sure the next step was singing a song about winged liner and friendship.\"\n\nYou glance both ways before crossing. \"Did it work?\"\n\n\"Oh, definitely not,\" Samantha says, grinning. \"I tried it and ended up looking like I lost a fight with a ballpoint pen. But it was very motivational.\"\n\nThe sun's warm, the sky clear, and she talks like there's no rush to get anywhere—which, technically, there isn't.

The, uh... the physical stuff is kind of hard to miss.\" She gestures vaguely in your direction, eyebrows raised, but not unkindly. \"You're definitely not built like how you were last year.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath, and she grins.\n\n \"But it's more than that,\" she goes on. \"You seem... I don't know. Lighter? Not in a floating-away sense, but like... like you're not dragging yourself around anymore.\"\n\n \"Huh,\" you say, surprised by how accurate that feels.\n\n \"What I'm trying to say is,\" she continues, a little more serious now, \"I know this wasn't your choice. The [referto] and everything—it's heavy. And I was ready for you to freak out, or push it all away, or try to, like, brute-force your way back to what you were.\"\n\n \"Was kind of my first instinct,\" you admit.\n\n She nods. \"But you didn't stay there. You're not fighting it the same way anymore. You're actually letting yourself see what fits. Not just clothes, but like—yourself. And that's kind of cool.\"\n\n You don't respond right away. It's a lot, hearing her say that. Hearing someone see it. The world's been changing around you for days now, and this is one of the few times someone's put it into words that feel... kind.\n\n Samantha, of all people.\n\n You glance over. \"You've gotten weirdly insightful lately.\"\n\n She makes a face. \"Ugh, I know. Don't tell anyone. Ruins the brand.\"\n\n You smile. The mall finally comes into view, glass windows glinting in the afternoon sun, banners waving lazily above the entrance.\n\n Samantha shades her eyes dramatically. \"At last. Civilization.\"\n\n \"We only walked twenty minutes.\"\n\n \"Still. My calves are screaming.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but your smile lingers as the two of you head toward the entrance. The glass doors slide open with a hiss of air conditioning, and you step into the mall side by side—ready for whatever chaos comes next.\n \n \n The mall's still a ways off—maybe five minutes if you don't stop for drinks or get sidetracked by a particularly aggressive patch of shade—but you can see it in the distance now, the lines of parking spaces visible behind the line of trees. Your legs are starting to ache, but you keep walking. Partly because Samantha's setting a brisk pace and talking nonstop, and partly because you don't want to lose the nerve.\n\n You're quiet for a beat too long, and she notices.\n\n \"What's up?\" she asks flatly. \"Did you accidentally swallow a bug or just remember something humiliating from seventh grade?\"\n\n You glance at her, the corner of your mouth twitching. \"Neither. I just... wanted to ask something.\"\n\n She slows just enough to shoot you a sideways glance. \"Go on.\"\n\n You watch your feet move over the sidewalk. One step, then the next. \"Do you think I've changed a lot lately?\"\n\n Samantha's quiet for a second. A real second, not her usual dramatic pause.\n\n You risk a glance at her. She's not smirking. Her brow is furrowed like she's turning the question over in her head before she hands you the answer.\n\n \"I mean... yeah,\" she says finally, not unkindly. \"You have.\"\n\n There's a rock in your throat now, just sitting there. You nod a little, trying to keep your voice casual. \"Physically, or...?\"\n\n \"Physically, definitely.\" She gestures vaguely at you. \"You've got the whole magical puberty speedrun going on. New shape, new face, new everything.\"\n\n You let out a weak laugh. \"Great.\"\n\n \"But mentally?\" she says, and now her voice is slower. \"Honestly, it kind of seems like you're dragging your feet.\"\n\n That stings more than you expect it to.\n\n She sees your expression and clarifies. \"Not in a mean way, okay? I'm not saying you're doing anything wrong. I just... I notice you freezing up, or zoning out when people call you cute, or pretending you don't hear stuff.\"\n\n \"It's just a lot,\" you say, trying to shrug it off.\n\n \"[name], I know it's a lot,\" she says, with more bite in her tone now—but not at you. At the whole situation. \"You got cursed by a witch at the Autumn Festival. That's, like, insane.\"\n\n You laugh despite yourself.\n\n \"But,\" she goes on, looking straight ahead, \"the changes aren't the problem. Hating the changes—that's what makes it harder.\"\n\n Your chest tightens. You don't say anything, because you're not sure what to say. You're not even sure if she's right. Maybe she is.\n\n For a while, neither of you speak. The only sounds are the crunching of autumn leaves and the low hum of traffic.\n\n Then she exhales, stretching her arms over her head, and says, \"Anyway. Enough feelings. We're, like, two minutes away from air conditioning and overpriced pretzels. Focus.\"\n\n You glance up.\n\n There it is. The mall.\n\n Big glass panels, sun glaring off the windows, and that familiar parking lot where the pavement's cracked just enough to trip you if you're not paying attention. The place you've walked past a hundred times but never really entered. Not like this, at least.\n\n You swallow once, then again.\n\n Samantha gives you a look. \"Ready to shop till you drop?\"\n\n You manage a nod. \"Yeah. Let's do it.\"\n\n And together, you step into the parking lot, the mall looming just ahead.\n \n\n \n The autumn leaves on the sidewalk crunches faintly beneath your sneakers. You and Samantha have been walking for a while now, trading stories or half-baked takes on pop culture—everything from ranking how boring each teacher is to whether dogs would have podcasts if they could talk. (Samantha maintains that they absolutely would, and that they'd all be about snacks.)\n\n But the laughter dies down for a second, and the question that's been tugging at your thoughts finally slips out.\n\n \"Be honest,\" you say, glancing sideways at her. \"Do you think I have any fashion potential?\"\n\n Samantha stops dead in her tracks.\n\n You turn to look at her, unsure if you've said anything weird, but she's just standing there in the middle of the sidewalk, arms crossed, staring at you like you just asked her to assess an ancient artifact.\n\n \"Huh,\" she says at last, narrowing her eyes.\n\n \"...What?\"\n\n She circles you once—literally walks around you—like she's examining something important.\n\n \"Well,\" she starts, dragging the word out like it's heavy. \"Let me put it this way. You're not totally hopeless.\"\n\n \"That's encouraging,\" you say flatly.\n\n \"You've got decent posture, and I guess your face is fine or whatever,\" she says with a casual wave of her hand. \"But your current wardrobe is actively working against you. Like, hostilely.\"\n\n \"Come on, it's not that bad,\" you insist, although you're not sure if even you believe those words.\n\n She raises her eyebrows. \"[name], I could recreate your outfit using any white dad's wardrobe.\"\n\n You groan. \"Okay, okay. I get it.\"\n\n She grins, clearly enjoying herself now. \"But,\" she adds, lifting a finger like she's about to make a dramatic speech, \"lucky for you, I have decided to bestow upon you the ancient wisdom of the fashion gods.\"\n\n \"Oh boy.\"\n\n \"Today,\" she declares, throwing her arms out wide, \"I, Samantha Rivera, save you.\"\n\n You try to act unimpressed, but your mouth quirks up anyway. There's something comforting about how excited she gets. Even when she's roasting you, she's invested.\n\n \"Alright, savior,\" you say. \"Lead the way.\"\n\n And right on cue, the mall comes into view—its wide glass facade glinting in the sunlight, the automatic doors just barely visible up ahead like the gateway to some chaotic makeover saga.\n\n Samantha shades her eyes and squints. \"There it is. The promised land.\"\n\n \"It's a mall,\" you state, deadpan.\n\n \"It's your mall now, [name],\" she says solemnly. \"Where you will rise from the ashes of white tees and khaki sin.\"\n\n You snort as the two of you walk the final stretch.\n\n The doors slide open with a soft hiss, and you step inside, the blast of cool air wrapping around you like a prelude to whatever madness Samantha has planned.\n\n \n You're about three-quarters through the long, sun-drenched trek to the mall when you glance sideways at Samantha and ask, \"Alright. What's your most cursed mall memory?\"\n \n She doesn't even hesitate. \"Easy. Forever 13. Dressing room. Sixth grade. The incident.\"\n\n You blink. \"...What incident?\"\n\n She lets out a sigh like she's bracing for emotional turbulence. \"So. I'm trying on these jeans, right? And it's one of those pairs with a bunch of holes in them, 'cause apparently that was my aesthetic back then.\"\n\n You stifle a laugh. She continues.\n\n \"I'm feeling myself. I'm doing that little mirror twirl thing. And I hear this sound behind me, like a splat. I turn around and—boom. There's a fucking churro on the floor of the dressing room. Sitting there. Judging me.\"\n\n \"A churro?\" you ask, squinting.\n\n \"Yup. Cinnamon sugar. No wrapper. Just sitting on the tile.\"\n\n You cough, trying not to lose it. \"Did someone throw it in there?\"\n\n \"Dude, I wish,\" she says, raising a hand. \"I look up. There's a vent. I look closer. I see that there's a second churro. Wedged. In the vent.\"\n\n You stare at her, trying to picture it. \"You're telling me—someone was stuffing churros into the air system?\"\n\n \"That's what I said! But when I told the employees, she looked me dead in the eyes and said, 'Oh yeah, he's back.' Like it was a thing.\"\n\n You stop walking for a second, unable to breathe as you laugh. Samantha just keeps marching, eyes narrowed like she's reliving the trauma.\n\n \"So now, every time I go to that store, I get flashbacks,\" she says, shaking her head. \"You know how some people have war stories? I have churro trauma.\"\n\n \"I'm never going near a vent.\"\n\n \"Good,\" she says. \"It's how they get you.\"\n\n You're still giggling when the mall finally comes into view, its glass doors glittering in the sunlight like the gates of some ridiculous temple. Samantha shields her eyes dramatically.\n\n \"There it is,\" she says. \"Ground zero for fashion, capitalism, and unexplained baked goods.\"\n\n You adjust your bag and fall into step beside her. \"Lets do this.\"\n\n \"May the churros stay in their proper places,\" she intones, making a solemn sign in the air.\n\n The two of you step forward as the automatic doors whoosh open, blasting you with crisp, chilled air and the distant echo of pop music.\n\n Mall acquired. Chaos pending.\n \n\n[Choice: Into the mall!]",

      "text": "The mall swallows you up in a rush of cool, manufactured air and the faint scent of cinnamon pretzels, fabric softener, and whatever cologne they're spraying at the men's department two stores down. It's a sudden shift from the sticky heat of outside to the sterile environment of retail therapy central. Floors polished so clean you can see the overhead lights reflecting, shoppers weaving in and out of storefronts, and ambient music pulsing softly from the ceiling.\n\nSamantha exhales like she's just crossed a brutal desert and made it to a glittering oasis. \"God, I forgot how dramatic this place is.\"\n\nShe stops just past the entrance and plants her hands on her hips, surveying the territory. Her eyes narrow, scanning the chaotic sprawl of stores—neon signage, pastel mannequins, glossy logos promising 30% off and new drops.\n\n\"Alright,\" she mutters, turning toward the oversized directory kiosk glowing to your right. She marches over to it like she's about to challenge it to a duel. \"Let's see. Blink + Shine is still around, that's good. NovaTrend... might be too preppy, but worth a look. And Cuddle Creations—okay, not fashion store, but emotionally necessary.\"\n\nYou glance sideways at her. \"Are we building a tactical plan of attack?\"\n\n\"Obviously. If we don't strategize, we'll end up in the back of a clearance bin surrounded by haunted denim.\"\n\nShe taps the screen to zoom in on the west wing of the mall, eyes tracking the store locations with laser focus. The mall isn't huge, but it's sprawling enough that one wrong turn could land you between a sleepwear boutique and a vitamin kiosk with no escape.\n\nThen, mid-scan, she pauses.\n\nTurns to you.\n\nCocks an eyebrow.\n\n\"You have a bra, right?\" she asks, completely casual.\n\nYou blink. \"What?\"\n\nShe squints at you like you've just said something confusing. \"I mean, obviously you do,\" she says, voice edged with that signature Samantha confidence, like the answer is so obvious it barely qualifies as a question. \"Right?\"\n\nHer tone isn't teasing—well, okay, maybe a little—but it's mostly matter-of-fact, like she's just confirming a checklist before a hike: water, sunscreen, map, bra. Totally normal.\n\n \n \n You open your mouth to respond, and for a second, the words catch.\n\n \"I've been using a binder,\" you say, finally. \"Coach Blake gave me one. Like... ten days ago?\"\n\n Samantha blinks. \"Wait. Coach Blake gave you a binder? She's kind of a hardass.\"\n\n You nod. \"She pulled me aside and said she figured I might want something better than... whatever towel situation I had going on before.\"\n\n \"Huh,\" Samantha mutters, her expression flickering through a few phases—surprise, then respect, then something like reluctant admiration. \"Okay. Kinda badass of her.\"\n\n You nod again, unsure where to look. \"It's been fine. I mean, it works. Sort of.\"\n\n She tilts her head, looking you over again, slower this time. \"But... you have boobs now.\"\n\n You flinch slightly, but her tone isn't mocking. It's just matter-of-fact. Blunt in the way she always is. She pauses. \"Like, actual boobs.\"\n\n You glance away. \"Yeah.\"\n\n She leans in, voice dropping like she's trying to make sure you're not just saying what she thinks you want to say. \"And you've been binding that? For ten days?\"\n\n \"Not the whole day,\" you say quickly. \"Just school. And at home. And whenever I'm around people.\"\n\n Samantha stares at you.\n\n \"[name],\" she says flatly. \"That's... that has to hurt.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you murmur, nodding. \"It does.\"\n\n For a second, she doesn't say anything. Her mouth opens, closes. Then she exhales sharply and scrubs a hand down her face.\n\n \"I'm not mad,\" she says, clearly trying to keep her voice level. \"I'm just—dude. That's not healthy. You can't just squish your lungs and ribs like that and call it a day.\"\n\n \"I didn't really know what else to do,\" you admit, voice quiet.\n\n \"I get that,\" she says, and there's a note of frustration in her voice now—not at you, but at the situation. \"And, like, shoutout to Coach Blake for stepping up. But that's not a long-term solution, [name]. You're not flat anymore. That binder wasn't made for... all this.\" She gestures vaguely at your torso, then sighs again. \"Look, if you're in pain every day just to feel like you can exist in public, that's a problem.\"\n\n You try to protest, but she's already stepping forward and grabbing your wrist. Not hard. Just enough to make it clear that this conversation is over and a new phase is beginning.\n\n \"Come on,\" she says. \"We're going to the bra store. Now.\"\n\n \"Samantha—\"\n\n \"Nope,\" she cuts you off. \"This isn't optional. I'm not letting you walk around with compressed ribs like you're trying to cosplay a pancake. We're fixing this. You're getting something that fits, that feels okay, and that doesn't actively hurt you.\"\n\n You manage a faint smile. \"You're bossy when you care.\"\n\n \"I'm always bossy,\" she mutters. \"Now shut up and let me be your responsible adult for the next fifteen minutes.\"\n\n Before you can get another word in, she's already tugging you down the corridor, weaving expertly through crowds of shoppers. You catch a glimpse of the store sign ahead—bright pink, mannequins in bralettes, a welcoming little heart in the logo—and your stomach flips a bit.\n\n You're not sure what's about to happen in there, but with Samantha beside you—fierce, focused, and fully committed—you suddenly feel just a little less scared.\n \n \n You hesitate for a moment, then glance away, your voice low. \"I've just been using a towel to bind my chest.\"\n\n Samantha stops.\n\n You don't look at her, but you can feel the shift in her energy like a temperature drop.\n\n \"...What?\" she says, flat.\n\n You scratch the back of your neck. \"Like... one of the older ones. It's soft. I wrap it around tight and—y'know, just keep it under my shirt.\"\n\n \"You've been binding with a towel?\" she repeats, voice rising in pitch.\n\n \"It works,\" you say quickly. \"Sort of. I mean, it flattens things. Enough.\"\n\n There's a long pause. You risk a glance at her and find her staring at you with wide eyes and a look that's caught somewhere between horrified, furious, and heartbreakingly concerned.\n\n \"Jesus, [name],\" she breathes. \"Are you trying to crush your own ribs?\"\n\n You try to laugh it off. \"Only emotionally.\"\n\n \"No. Nope. No bad jokes. I am—\" She pinches the bridge of her nose. \"You absolute disaster. Of course you used a towel. Might as well use a medieval torture device to survive the next week. The brazen bull or iron maiden sounds about right.\"\n\n \"It was all I had,\" you mumble.\n\n Her eyes flick to your chest, then back to your face, and for a second all the sarcasm drains out of her. \"Does it hurt?\"\n\n You hesitate before nodding. \"Yeah.\"\n\n She closes her eyes like that physically pained her. \"[name].\"\n\n You open your mouth, but she raises a hand before you can speak.\n\n \"I'm not mad at you,\" she says, and her voice has that raw edge again, like she's holding something in. \"I'm mad that you felt you had to do that. That it got bad enough you were just walking around every day with a towel duct-taped to your ribs like that's normal.\"\n\n \"It's not duct-taped—\"\n\n \"Not the point!\"\n\n You fall silent.\n\n She exhales hard, then softens, stepping closer. \"Look, I get it. I really do. The curse, your body, all this confusing hormone-wizardry... It's a lot. And I know you've been trying to just power through it like you always do. But hurting yourself to survive it? That's not powering through. That's slowly falling apart.\"\n\n You look down at the floor, throat tight.\n\n \"I'm sorry for yelling, I just hate seeing you like this,\" she says, softer now. \"You're my best friend. And yeah, I give you crap all the time, but that's because you wear cargo shorts unironically, not because I want you suffering in silence.\"\n\n You huff out a weak laugh. \"They have good pockets.\"\n\n \"They have sins,\" she corrects, eyes narrowing. Then she grabs your wrist. \"Okay. That's it. Emergency boob intervention time. We're going to the bra store. Now.\"\n\n \"What?\"\n\n \"No arguments,\" she snaps. \"You're getting properly measured, you're getting something soft and supportive, and we're retiring that stupid-ass towel to a life of drying dishes like God intended.\"\n\n You try to protest, but she's already dragging you down the corridor, her grip warm and unwavering.\n\n \"You don't have to wear it forever,\" she adds over her shoulder. \"You just have to not crush your ribcage like you're reenacting a Victorian corset ad.\"\n\n You don't know whether to laugh or hide, but there's something about the way she keeps glancing back to make sure you're still with her that makes it all feel... less terrifying.\n\n The bra store comes into view up ahead—bright pink, mannequins in bralettes, a welcoming little heart in the logo.\n\n You're not sure what's waiting for you inside.\n\n But you are sure that Samantha's not letting go of your wrist until you get there.\n \n\n \n \n You scratch the back of your neck and glance away. \"I don't.\"\n\n Samantha turns to look at you fully, one eyebrow raised. \"Wait—you don't have a bra? Like, at all?\"\n\n You shrug. \"I mean... I still have a flat chest. I didn't really think I needed one yet.\"\n\n For a second, she just stares at you, like she's trying to process a puzzle that doesn't quiet add up. Then she makes a face. Not judgmental—just baffled, like she's genuinely concerned about how you've made it this far without spontaneously combusting from discomfort.\n\n \"Okay,\" she says, exhaling. \"Yeah, no. That's gonna change. Now.\"\n\n You blink. \"What? Why?\"\n\n She throws her hands up. \"Because, [name], have you looked at yourself lately?\"\n\n You glance down at your top. \"I mean, kinda?\"\n\n <<if [feminineLooks] > 39>> \n Samantha gives you a quick once-over. \"You know you're giving 'who are they' energy, right? Like people are gonna do a double take and then argue about whether you're a boy or a girl.\"\n <<elseif [feminineLooks] > 59>> \n She gestures at you with both hands like it's obvious. \"[name], people are gonna see you and assume you're a girl who just happens to thrift her clothes.\"\n <<elseif [feminineLooks] > 79>> \n Samantha stops, stares at you, and lets out a small, incredulous laugh. \"Okay, real talk? No one's clocking you as anything but a girl right now. Like, zero confusion.\"\n \n\n You open your mouth to object, but she cuts you off with a wave.\n\n \"And no, I'm not saying you need a push-up bra, or, like, lace or anything. But, dude—people are gonna start making assumptions. Like, soon. And wearing the same tops and pretending you haven't changed isn't gonna work forever.\"\n\n You fold your arms. \"I was just trying not to overthink it.\"\n\n \"And that's why I exist,\" she says proudly, placing a hand on her chest. \"To overthink it for you.\"\n\n You sigh, but there's no real resistance in it. Samantha's never exactly been subtle, but when she gets that determined glint in her eye—the one she usually reserves for school projects and vending machine attacks—you know there's no point in arguing.\n\n She softens just a little bit, putting her hand on your shoulder. \"Look. I'm not saying a bra is, like, a magical fix. But even a simple one? It's gonna feel better. More secure. You won't have to keep adjusting your top like you're smuggling a loaf of bread under there.\"\n\n \"Wow,\" you say. \"Thanks.\"\n\n \"You're welcome!\" she says cheerfully. \"Now come on. Bra store's this way.\"\n\n Before you can protest, she loops her fingers around you wrist and starts marching off with purpose, weaving through clusters of shoppers like she owns the place. You stumble a bit trying to keep up.\n\n \"Samantha—\"\n\n \"Nope. Too late. You had your chance,\" she says over her shoulder. \"You asked for fashion help, and you're getting the Full Sam Experience™. That includes properly supportive undergarments and exactly zero arguments.\"\n\n You sigh again, but you're smiling, just a little.\n\n Up ahead the storefront comes into view—bright pink, mannequins in bralettes, a welcoming little heart in the logo. The music playing is some kind of ethereal indie pop, and the air smells faintly like new cotton.\n\n Samantha squeezes your wrist, not hard, but firmly enough to show she's by your side.\n\n You know she's right with you.\n \n \n \"I mean... kinda,\" you say.\n\n Samantha narrows her eyes at you immediately. \"Kinda?\"\n\n You shrug, sheepish. \"Someone gave me a sports bra. Like a spare. I've just been wearing that.\"\n\n Her brows shoot up. \"Oh wow, a random sports bra. Truly, the pinnacle of precision support.\"\n\n You sigh. \"It's not that bad.\"\n\n She gives you a look—sharp and skeptical. \"[name]. Come on. You haven't even been measured, have you?\"\n\n You shake your head, already bracing for what's coming.\n\n \"Of course not,\" she mutters, half to herself. \"Because why would you do the sane thing when you could just gamble your comfort on mystery spandex?\"\n\n You smile faintly. \"It was free.\"\n\n \"Oh great, even better,\" she says, throwing her hands up. \"Because nothing screams 'perfect fit' like a mystery bra from someone's drawer.\"\n\n \"I didn't want to make a big deal out of it,\" you say quietly. \"It was just... easier.\"\n\n Samantha's expression softens, the sarcasm cooling to something gentler beneath the surface. \"Look, I'm glad you've got something, okay? That's already better than wrapping yourself in duct tape or whatever horror you were probably considering. But, [name]—be real. You've got boobs now.\"\n\n You flush but say nothing.\n\n She nudges you lightly with her elbow. \"And I say this with love and possibly a moral obligation as your best friend: your girls deserve better.\"\n\n You laugh despite yourself, covering your face with one hand. \"God, don't call them that.\"\n\n \"Then you come up with a better term,\" she says cheerfully. \"In the meantime, we're getting you properly measured by someone who knows what they're doing.\"\n\n \"I don't know if I'm ready for all that,\" you admit.\n\n She arches an eyebrow. \"Too bad. I'm dragging you straight into the land of lace and logic. It's happening.\"\n\n And true to her word, she grabs you wrist before you can think of a clever excuse and starts pulling you.\n\n \"You can hide behind a hoodie all you want,\" she says over her shoulder, \"but you are not walking around in a mystery bra like some kind of boob cryptid. We're fixing this.\"\n\n You groan softly but let yourself be dragged along, her grip firm and warm around your wrist. The storefront glows in front of you—bright pink, mannequins in bralettes, a welcoming little heart in the logo—and for once, you don't feel like bolting.\n\n You're still nervous, sure. But with Samantha in front, determined and unapologetic, you figure you can survive anything for a little while longer.\n\n Even this.\n \n \n You shift your weight awkwardly and glance off to the side. \"I mean... kinda?\"\n\n Samantha stops in her tracks. \"Kinda?\" she echoes, already suspicious. \"What does kinda mean? You either have a bra or you don't.\"\n\n You wince. \"I... don't.\"\n\n There's a beat. Then her eyes go wide. \"Wait—you've just been freeballing it?\"\n\n You make a vague gesture. \"I've been wearing, like, regular tops. Hoodies. T-shirts. Loose stuff.\"\n \n She stares at you, utterly scandalized. \"[name]. You have boobs. You can't just let them roam. That's not a sustainable lifestyle.\"\n\n You open your mouth, but she steamrolls over whatever excuse you were about to offer.\n\n \"No support? No structure? No anything? What, are you just out here letting gravity take the wheel like it's a trust exercise?\"\n\n You start to laugh despite yourself, but she's not done. She pinches the bridge of her nose, muttering like she's genuinely concerned for your future. \"I swear to God, if I ever have to hear you complain about back pain after this, I'm just gonna throw a bra at you and walk away.\"\n\n \"I didn't think it was that big of a deal,\" you say weakly. \"They're not... that big.\"\n\n \"Not the point!\" she snaps, waving dramatically. \"It's not about size, it's about support, comfort, health, the sanctity of your poor, innocent spine—should I keep going?\"\n\n \"No,\" you sigh, already knowing exactly where this is heading.\n\n She folds her arms, eyes narrowing with renewed purpose. \"You are getting a bra. Today. A real one. With straps and measurements and cups and everything.\"\n\n You take a half-step back. \"Do I have a say in this?\"\n\n \"Nope!\" she chirps, grabbing your wrist. \"You lost that right the moment you said 'kinda' and confessed to letting your boobs just hang out like a couple of unpaid interns.\"\n\n You groan as she starts hauling you down the corridor, but there's no real fight in you. Her grip is solid, her hair bouncing with each determined step as she cuts through the crowd with the efficiency of someone on a sacred mission.\n\n The bra store looms ahead—bright pink, mannequins in bralettes, a welcoming little heart in the logo. The inside smells like new cotton.\n\n \"Don't worry,\" Samantha says over her shoulder as she yanks you toward the entrance. \"We'll start simple. Nothing lacy. Nothing frilly. Just something that'll keep your chest from floating around like a pair of confused ghosts.\"\n\n \"Wow,\" you mutter. \"Thanks for the visual.\"\n\n \"You're welcome. Now get in there.\"\n\n The doors slide open.\n\n You take a breath.\n\n And let her pull you inside.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Bra store!]",

      "text": "The moment the store door closes behind you, the atmosphere changes completely. It's warmer inside than the mall corridor, tinged with floral perfume and a soft trace of vanilla that seems baked into the walls. The lighting is low and warm, the kind that makes everything look softer, slower. Even the way the displays are arranged feels intentional—gentle and careful, like the whole place is trying to wrap you in a quiet hug.\n\nLace and cotton bralettes line the walls in neat pastel rows, some folded, some hung. A few mannequins stand nearby in coordinated sets, posed like they know exactly what they're doing here. Samantha steps forward like she's been here before—maybe she has—and casually gestures for you to follow. You do, feeling a little nervous, but taking one wary step at a time nevertheless.\n\nBehind the counter stands a woman that looks to be in her late-twenties, sorting a pile of neatly wrapped hangers into bins. Her sleek hair is pulled into a low bun, and her nametag reads Riley.\n\nWhen she sees you both, she smiles without missing a beat. Not that overly cheery customer service smile—just an easy, grounded one that makes your stomach unclench half a notch.\n\n\"Hey there,\" Riley says, tucking the last hanger away and coming around the corner. \"Can I help you two with anything?\"\n\nSamantha jumps in immediately, her voice smooth and just vague enough. \"Yup—my friend here needs a fitting. First time. Hasn't been measured before.\"\n\nRiley nods like she hears that every day. If she notices the slight awkwardness in the air, she doesn't show it. No weird expression, no raised brow, no glance that lingers longer than it should.\n\n\"Of course,\" she says warmly. \"No pressure here. We'll just get some measurements and bring out a few starter styles. Nothing too tight or loose, nothing itchy. Comfort is the priority.\"\n\nYou nod once, not trusting yourself to speak just yet. She turns and starts leading you toward the back, and Samantha walks alongside her, already scanning the displays like she's mentally building an outfit in her head.\n\n\"Let me knows if there are any fabrics or styles you absolutely hate,\" Riley says. \"This store's got wireless, lightly padded, structured, unstructured—basically, if you can imagine it, we've got a version of it that won't feel like medieval armor.\"\n\nSamantha pipes up, \"Ooh, what about those ones that feel like clouds but still hold things in place? Asking for a very particular person whose spine deserves some kindness for once.\"\n\nYou glance at her with a tired look. \"You mean me?\"\n\n\"I would never name names,\" she replies sweetly.\n\nRiley chuckles, but doesn't push. She stops in front of a row of fitting rooms, each with soft curtains and a tiny sign hung from the hook outside. Thankfully, all of them are empty.\n\n\"This one's open and good to go,\" she says, opening up a door to reveal a cozy space inside—cream-colored walls, lighting that doesn't feel cruel, a plush bench, and a mirror.\n\nYou take a step forward, then pause, hands at your sides. There's something strange about stepping into a place like this. Private, but not yours. Safe, but unfamiliar.\n\nRiley seems to catch the hesitation. She smiles gently and says, \"Just let me know whenever you're ready. I'll grab a couple things once we have a general sense of fit.\"\n\nYou nod, your throat dry. \"Okay. Thanks.\"\n\nShe gives you a reassuring smile before turning to step away.\n\nAnd then Samantha is standing just outside the fitting room, peeking in, her usual grin softened at the edges.\n\n\"Want me to come in with you?\" she asks. There's no sarcasm in her voice this time. Just that quiet, slightly crooked sincerity she reserves for when things actually matter. \"I can hang out here if you'd rather. No pressure.\"\n\n[Choice: Ask for Samantha to come with you]\n[Choice: Go in alone]",

      "text": "You hesitate for a breath, fingers still resting lightly on the edge of the fitting room door. Then you glance back at Samantha, still standing just outside, her head tilted in that patient way she has when she knows you're weighing something.\n\n \"...Yeah,\" you say quietly. \"You can come in.\"\n\n Her face lights up. Not in that exaggerated, theatrical way she usually puts on when she's about to roast you—but with something real. Soft, excited, proud.\n\n \"Hell yes,\" she says, pushing the door open just enough to slip inside and click it gently shut behind her. \"Honestly? I was hoping you'd say that. I mean, come on—I get to be the one here for your first bra fitting? This is basically sacred best friend duty.\"\n\n You give her a look, but she's already setting her bag down on the little bench in the corner like she's claimed the spot permanently.\n\n She flops down with a dramatic sigh and crosses her legs. \"Look, I know I joke a lot, but seriously—I'm honored. This is a big deal. You're not doing this weird limbo thing alone. I got you. And also,\" she adds, eyes gleaming a little. \"it is absolutely my responsibility to make sure you get a bra that doesn't suck.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath. \"Thanks, Sam.\"\n\n She offers you a thumbs-up like she's been officially assigned as your moral support and emotional bra consultant.\n\n You stand in front of the mirror again, hands resting at the hem of your top.\n\n You pause.\n\n Time to get ready.\n\n \n \n You pull your top up and over your head, the fabric catching slightly at the shoulders before slipping off. The air in the fitting room feels cooler against your skin. Underneath, the snug compression fabric clings close—flattening everything into a shape that almost passes for what you used to look like.\n\n You've gotten used to it—how it limits your movement, how it hugs too tight under your arms—but standing here, under soft lights, it suddenly feels more obvious\n\n Samantha exhales low, eyes flicking to it, then to your face. \"Okay,\" she says, tone unreadable for a second. Then it softens. \"So you have been dealing with this on hard mode.\"\n\n You don't say anything at first. She crosses her arms and leans against the wall.\n\n \"Well, it's done its job,\" she says after a beat. \"But we're absolutely getting you out of that thing and into something that doesn't feel like a medieval chest trap.\"\n\n You manage a weak smile. \"I'm used to it.\"\n\n \"Doesn't mean you should have to be,\" she replies, and there's no sarcasm in her voice this time—just her, steady and present. \"Let's find you something that lets you breathe.\"\n \n \n The shirt peels off awkwardly, catching a little where it's tucked into the towel wrapped tight around your chest. It's fraying near the edge, the knot in the back tied just right to hold firm but not cut off your circulation—hopefully.\n\n It's not elegant. Not safe. Just what you have.\n\n Samantha stares for a second, blinking. Then her expression twists, eyebrows shooting up, mouth already halfway to a word that dies before it's fully formed.\n\n \"...That's a towel,\" she says, pointing like she's spotted a health code violation in a restaurant.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you mutter, avoiding her eyes. \"I didn't have anything else.\"\n\n She takes a breath, tapping her foot. \"Okay. First of all—creative. Truly. But also? [name]. Bestie. No.\"\n\n You almost laugh at the string of emotions—somewhere between horrified and disappointed.\n\n \"You wrapped a towel around yourself like a snack burrito. No wonder you've been walking weird.\"\n\n You shrug. \"It worked.\"\n\n \"Sure. And I could use duct tape as eyeliner, and it would work, but that doesn't mean I should.\"\n\n She looks at you again, really looks, and her voice dips a little. \"Let's get you something that won't try to suffocate you, yeah?\"\n\n You nod, and she grins faintly. \"That's what I thought.\"\n \n \n \n \n You lift your shirt up and over your head in one smooth motion. The air hits your skin—cool, comfortable. There's nothing underneath—no compression, no support gear. Just... you.\n\n And despite everything, your chest is still flat. Still unchanged.\n\n Samantha watches for a second, her expression unreadable. Then she blinks. \"Huh.\"\n\n \"What?\"\n\n \"You know, I was ready for, like, something dramatic. Some boobs, I don't know. But you're just...\" She gestures vaguely. \"Still doing your thing.\"\n\n You glance at your reflection.\n\n \"I guess I haven't changed much. Not there, anyway.\"\n\n Samantha nods. \"Hey, that's fine. Not a problem, just... good to know. Means we don't have to go full support mode today, but we can still get you something soft and comfy. Never hurts to have options.\"\n\n You tilt your head. \"You're not gonna make me try on lace?\"\n\n \"I'm not that much of a monster,\" she says, scoffing. \"I was thinking cotton. Maybe in beige.\"\n\n You laugh—and it actually feels easy.\n \n \n You peel off your top, slow and careful. Underneath, the sports bra clings to you—simple, black, no-frills. It's stretched out in places and not exactly made for... what you've got now, but it does the job. Mostly.\n\n The straps dig in a little. It's fine. You've dealt with worse.\n\n Samantha's eyes flick over it once, then she lets out a breath like she's been holding it since you walked in. \"Okay. that's something. Functional. Practical. Slightly tragic.\"\n\n You shoot her a look. \"It was free.\"\n\n \"Let me guess—hand-me-down from someone who runs track and doesn't believe in labels?\"\n\n You smirk. \"Something like that.\"\n\n She steps closer and tugs gently at one strap, then lets it snap back. \"That thing's probably older than both of us. You deserve better.\"\n\n \"It works.\"\n\n \"Yeah, but so do rotary phones and VHS tapes,\" she says. \"Doesn't mean we're gonna bring them back.\"\n\n She gives your shoulder a quick, reassuring nudge. \"Let's upgrade you to something that doesn't scream 2008.\"\n \n \n You pull off your top slowly, suddenly hyper-aware of every movement, every shift in fabric. Your chest is bare underneath—no binder, no layers, no protection. Just skin, soft and real, and no longer something you can ignore or hide.\n\n The cool air touches you differently now. You feel exposed. Not in a bad way, just... raw.\n\n You don't look at the mirror right away. You don't look at Samantha either.\n\n She's quiet for a beat, then her voice comes, gentler than you expected.\n\n \"Okay. Wow.\"\n\n You brace yourself.\n\n \"Look at you,\" she says, not teasing. Not laughing. Just... observing. \"Walking around like this isn't a big deal. That's some grade-A bravery.\"\n\n You finally glance at her. She's not gawking. Just watching. There's a softness in her eyes, like she's been handed something fragile and knows better than to squeeze.\n\n You try to joke. \"Figured I'd let gravity take the wheel.\"\n\n She snorts. \"Gravity's rude. We'll find you something that fights back.\"\n\n Then she adds, quieter. \"And something that makes you feel okay looking at yourself.\"\n\n You nod, slowly. A little unsteady. But glad she's here.\n\n She flashes you a half-grin. \"Alright. Let's get measured and fix this.\"\n \n \n There's a soft knock on the fitting room door—two quick raps, light and practiced.\n\n \"Hey,\" comes Riley's voice from the other side, calm and warm. \"You two ready for me to come in?\"\n\n You look up, startled out of your own thoughts. The mirror catches the faint tension in your shoulders, the way your fingers are still curled loosely at your sides.\n\n Samantha, sitting cross-legged on the bench now, glances at you instead of the door. Her voice is quieter than usual, but still unmistakably her. \"Are you?\"\n\n You nod once, steadying your breath. \"Yeah. I'm ready.\"\n\n She nods back like that settles it.\n\n \"Come on in,\" she calls toward the door.\n\n The knob turns gently, and Riley steps inside with the kind of ease that makes you feel like she's done this a hundred times before—because she has. She doesn't make a show of looking around, doesn't blink twice at Samantha sitting on the bench or at you standing by the mirror.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says, smile still soft. \"Thanks for waiting. We'll take this one step at a time, okay? Nothing uncomfortable, and you can stop me whenever.\"\n\n You nod again, and Riley closes the door behind her with a quiet click.\n\n She pulls a measuring tape from around her neck and straightens slightly, giving you just enough space without feeling distant.\n\n \"Let's start with a few easy measurements,\" she says gently. \"You can just relax.\"\n\n You try.\n\n \n Riley steps closer, her hands steady and sure as she unwraps the measuring tape and gently loops it around your back.\n\n \"Alright, just breathe normally,\" she says, her tone even and calm. \"This part's quick.\"\n\n You feel the cool fabric of the tape slide beneath your arms and across your chest. It presses snugly for a moment, not tight, just enough to make you hyper-aware of your shape—of how much there is now.\n\n Riley's eyes flick to the numbers, then she adjusts slightly, measuring again just under your bust.\n\n \"Okay,\" she says with a small nod. \"Looks like a 36 band... and about a B cup. Pretty balanced fit overall.\"\n\n You freeze a little at that. Hearing it spoken aloud makes it feel real in a new way. Not theoretical. Not just your reflection. Something measurable. Defined.\n\n Riley meets your eyes briefly and offers a smile that doesn't feel patronizing. \"Nothing out of the ordinary. Super common size. We've got tons of comfy options for this range.\"\n\n From the bench, Samantha nods like she already knew. \"See? I told you you'd have good proportions.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but you're grateful.\n \n \n The measuring tape glides under your arms and across your chest like a ribbon, cool against your skin. Riley works quickly but gently, adjusting the tape at your back, then again along your bust.\n\n \"Just breathe easy,\" she murmurs. \"Almost done.\"\n\n There's a short pause as she checks the number.\n\n \"Looks like a 34 band,\" she says, adjusting slightly and nodding. \"And just about an A cup. A classic starting point.\"\n\n You shift slightly on your feet, uncertain whether to be relieved or embarrassed.\n\n Riley seems to pick up on it. \"Totally normal, by the way. Bodies develop at different speeds. A cup sizes are super easy to shop for, and a lot of our softer styles are built with this in mind.\"\n\n Samantha hums. \"A-plus for the A-cup,\" she says, tapping at the bench with her fingers. \"We're officially in starter bra territory.\"\n\n You huff a quiet laugh and don't quiet meet her eye, but you don't feel as nervous now.\n \n \n Riley steps in, guiding the tape around your torso with quiet efficiency. It sits flat against your skin—there's nothing to press into, nothing to measure in curves. Just a shape you've always known.\n\n She reads the numbers, her voice calm. \"32 band,\" she says, making a small adjustment, double-checking. \"And about an AA cup.\"\n\n You nod faintly. That's about what you expected. Still, hearing it spoken aloud feels... odd. Like something that doesn't quite match everything else you've been going through.\n\n But Riley doesn't flinch, doesn't blink.\n\n \"That's totally valid,\" she says, as if reading your thoughts. \"Some folks stay here. Some don't. Either way, there are great pieces that'll feel comfortable and still give you coverage or shape if that's what you're after.\"\n\n Samantha leans forward from the bench. \"So basically: we're in comfy bralette territory. Minimalist. Clean. Iconic.\"\n\n You smile, just a little. \"Sounds manageable.\"\n\n Riley nods, already jotting things down. \"Let's find you something that fits just right.\"\n \n\n \n You take a breath, eyes flicking up to meet Samantha's.\n\n \"I think...\" You hesitate, then find your voice again. \"I wanna do this alone.\"\n\n She doesn't even blink.\n\n \"Totally fair,\" she says, immediately, like she'd already figured that might be your answer. Her voice is gentle, not teasing for once. \"You've got this. I'll be right out here. Holler if you need anything—or if the measuring tape tries to fight you.\"\n\n You manage a small, grateful smile.\n\n She gives you a lazy little salute, then backs away with a wink. \"See you on the other side, mystery size.\"\n\n And just like that, she disappears from view, her steps quiet.\n\n You reach out and push the door closed.\n\n Now it's just you and the mirror.\n\n \n \n You pull your top off slowly, already feeling the pressure from the tight, black binder beneath it. It clings to your chest, compressing everything into place like armor. It's familiar, and you've been relying on it for a while now. It works for the most part.\n\n But standing under this soft lighting, in this space that's supposed to be about fit and comfort, the way the binder presses into your ribs, suddenly feeling too sharp. Too restrictive. You twist side to side, stretching a little, wincing as the fabric digs in.\n\n You catch your reflection in the mirror. The binder gives you shape, or rather, takes shape away. But it also takes ease with it.\n\n You don't hate it, but you're not sure if you want to keep wearing something that hurts to feel okay.\n \n \n You tug your top over your head slowly, wincing as the rough knot of fabric digs into your ribs. The towel you've wrapped around your chest is tight—too tight—but it's the only thing you have.\n\n As you undo the makeshift binding, the pressure lifts suddenly, leaving behind a dull ache and a faint red mark.\n\n You look at yourself in the mirror and feel both exposed and strangely relieved. The towel was always a temporary solution. You knew that. It was never meant to last, it was just supposed to get you here.\n \n \n \n \n Your shirt comes off easily, the fabric light over your still-flat chest. There's no curve to hide. Your torso is smooth and angular, the way it's always been, even as everything else seems to keep shifting around you.\n\n You glance at your reflection, expecting to feel small. But you don't. Not quite.\n\n You don't need a bra for support, at least not yet. But you're here anyway, and it never hurts to get one just in case.\n \n \n You lift your top and tug it off in one smooth motion, revealing the snug band of your sports bra underneath. It's plain, and was a gift from someone who thought you'd need it. It does the job, pressing down just enough that you don't think about it too much during the day.\n\n You glance at the mirror and run your fingers under the band. It's not uncomfortable, but it's not great either. It's... functional. But you want comfortable.\n \n \n You pull your shirt over your head slowly, revealing your bare chest underneath. You don't have a bra, or a binder, or anything. Your breasts are soft and visible, a quiet presence that's been increasingly harder to ignore.\n\n You came here for a reason. To stop pretending this isn't happening and to be comfortable. Maybe it's time to stop pretending that real is something to be afraid of.\n \n \n \n There's a soft knock on fitting room door—two quick raps, light and practiced.\n\n \"Hey, it's Riley,\" comes her calm voice. \"Ready for me to come in for the fitting?\"\n\n You swallow, barely managing a quiet, \"Yeah.\"\n\n The door opens and Riley steps inside with a soft smile and a flexible measuring tape looped around her neck. She closes the door gently behind her, moving with a practiced confidence. It's clear she's done this a thousand times and isn't about to make it weird.\n\n \"No stress,\" she says lightly. \"It'll just be two quick measurements—should only take a second. Relax your arms for me?\"\n\n You nod and stand a little straighter, heart fluttering just beneath your skin.\n\n \n Riley starts with the band measurement—firm but gentle as she wraps the tape beneath your chest. Then she moves upward, looping it carefully around the fullest part of your chest.\n\n You feel the heat in your cheeks rise. There is definitely no hiding the size now.\n\n Riley finishes and pulls back with a nod.\n\n \"You're measuring at a 36B,\" she says. \"That means you'll probably want medium support—something with shaping, maybe a soft underwire. But there's no pressure to go structured unless you want it.\"\n\n You blink. \"B?\" you repeat in a whisper.\n\n \"Yep,\" she says, unfazed. \"That's totally normal. You don't have to hide anything, but you don't have to show anything either. Just choose what feels right to you.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you murmur. \"That... helps.\"\n \n \n Riley wraps the measuring tape beneath your chest first, the soft edge resting against your ribs. She calls out the band size, then moves it upward, gently looping it across the curve of your chest. There's just enough pressure to feel, not enough to squeeze.\n\n You can't help noticing how much more there is than there used to be.\n\n She just reads the number, pulls back, and smiles.\n\n \"You're a 34A,\" she says. \"Which means you've got some shape but you're still in the lighter support zone. I'll bring you soft cups, maybe one with some lining if you're curious about it.\"\n\n You nod, arms hovering awkwardly at your sides.\n\n \"You've got options here,\" she adds. \"You don't have to hide anything, but you don't have to show anything either. Just choose what feels right to you.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you murmur. \"That... helps.\"\n \n \n Riley steps in front of you and wraps the measuring tape around your ribcage, right beneath your chest. It settles there without any resistance—just skin and bone, no curve to measure. She calls out a quiet number under her breath before shifting the tape upward across the flattest part of your chest.\n \n \"Alright,\" she says, straightening. \"You're measuring around a 32AA. That puts you in a flat-fit or soft bralette category. Just something comfortable and light.\"\n\n You nod, exhaling slowly.\n \n \n\n[Choice: See your options]",

      "text": "A few minutes pass in quiet after Riley steps out. Then, there's a gentle knock. \"Got a few options for you!\" Riley announces.\n\nYou crack the door open just enough to take them. She hands you a neat little stack of bras, each on a padded hanger, her smile warm but never too much.\n\n\"I got three basics and one that's a little more fun, if you're up for it.\"\n\nYou nod, murmuring a quiet thank you as she vanishes down the hall again.\n\nYou hang the bras one by one on the hook. They sway slightly, catching the light.\n\nYou run your fingers over the first one—white, smooth, and soft. Simple. It feels like the safe option. The kind you could wear without thinking or announcing anything. Just... functional.\n\nNext is a lavender one. Something about the color makes your breath hitch slightly. It's soft too, but a little more delicate, a little more expressive. It feels like something someone picked for themselves, not just to hide in.\n\nThe third is black. Sleek. Minimalist. There's something about it that feels... grounded. Like it belongs to someone who already knows what they want, who they are. You don't know if that's you yet, but it tugs at something in your chest.\n\nAnd then there's the last one—lacy black, floral stitching curling across the cups. It has a certain elegance to it that makes you hesitate. It's bold, feminine, and pretty.\n\n \n You run your fingers along one of them, the fabric light and smooth beneath your touch, and mutter mostly to yourself, \"I'll just get one.\"\n\n From the bench, Samantha shrugs like it's the most obvious thing in the world. \"Then get the one you actually like.\"\n\n You glance at her. She's not pushing. Just watching, legs crossed, expression calm.\n\n \"One that feels right,\" she adds. \"Not just what's practical. You deserve that much, [name].\"\n\n \n \"I'll just get one,\" you say to yourself.\n \n\nYour hand lingers between the lavender and the black for a moment longer before you take one down from the hook.\n\n[Choice: Get the basic white bra]\n[Choice: Get the basic black bra]\n[Choice: Get the basic lavender bra]\n[Choice: Get the lacy black bra]",

      "text": "You pick up the white bra from the hook, holding it in both hands like you're still not totally sure it's real. It's nothing fancy—no lace, no bows, no pastel polka dots or shimmering straps. Just clean, soft cotton with a gentle curve to the cups and wide, comfortable-looking bands. It's the kind of thing that doesn't try to be anything more than what it is.\n\n Simple. Uncomplicated. Quiet.\n\n You run your thumb along the edge. There's no dramatic reveal. No butterflies. Just a subtle kind of... yes.\n\n \"I think I'll go with this one,\" you say softly, more to yourself than anyone else.\n\n Samantha, naturally, hears it anyway.\n\n \"The white one?\" she echoes, dramatically scandalized. \"Classic. Timeless. Slightly boring. I respect it.\"\n\n You roll your eyes without looking up.\n\n \"No, but seriously,\" she continues, flopping sideways on the bench like she's doing color commentary on your soul. \"You could've picked the lacy black one that Luke would like. But no. You? You go for soft white. You are terrifyingly responsible.\"\n\n \"Its comfortable,\" you mutter.\n\n \"It's aggressively neutral. I love it. You're going full blank-slate-core.\"\n\n You smile faintly and turn back to the mirror, the bra still in your hands. There's no drama to it. No rush. Just you, deciding.\n\n You slip the straps over your shoulders and carefully adjust it into place. The band fits snug but not tight. The cups settle comfortably against your chest. It doesn't dig in. It doesn't shout anything about who you are or who you're supposed to be.\n\n It just fits.\n\n You look up into the mirror.\n\n The reflection looking back is still you. A little more held together. A little more... you-shaped.\n\n Samantha's watching without a word now, her usual smirk replaced by something quieter. Pride, maybe.\n\n You nod once, almost to yourself.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"This is definitely the one.\"\n \n \n \n Your eyes move slowly over the small stack of options Riley left on the hooks. But your gaze ends up settling on a simple black bra.\n\n It's not dramatic. Not lacy or strappy or trying to be edgy. Just matte black cotton, seamless cups, and clean lines. No shine, no frills. Understated—but certain.\n\n You reach for it.\n\n \"I think...\" you say, almost to yourself. \"This one.\"\n\n You lift it carefully, letting the straps fall loose over your hands. The fabric is soft and flexible, the kind that feels like it's been washed a few times even though it's brand new. There's something grounding about it—quietly confident. It doesn't ask for permission to exist.\n\n From the bench, Samantha perks up. \"Ooh, going with the black bra. Power move.\"\n\n You glance at her in the mirror. \"You think?\"\n\n She leans forward, one leg swinging lazily. \"Oh, absolutely. Black is like, the cool older cousin of mine. Still classic, but with a tiny bit of menace. Like, 'Yeah, I'm wearing a bra, and I might also be plotting something.'\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"I'm not plotting anything.\"\n\n She shrugs. \"Not yet. But now you have the potential. That's the power of a black bra, my friend.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath, shaking your head, then turn back to the mirror. Your reflection stares back at you—shoulders slightly tense, lips pressed together. You shift your weight. The bra still rests in your hands, waiting.\n\n \"I like how it's simple,\" you say. \"Not trying to prove anything.\"\n\n Samantha smiles. \"Exactly. It just sits there and does its job. You've gotta respect that.\"\n\n You nod, then step back from the mirror and take a breath.\n\n You slowly pull the bra over your shoulders, adjusting the band behind your back. The fabric is soft where it touches your skin, snug but not squeezing. The straps settle comfortably—no pinching, no slipping. The cups mold gently over what you have there as well.\n\n You turn, checking yourself from a few angles. It doesn't flatten you. Doesn't exaggerate either. It just fits. The black fabric lies smooth across your chest, clean lines and quiet intent.\n\n You look to Samantha. She gives a little nod, more serious than her usual teasing.\n\n \"Yeah,\" she says, arms crossed. \"That's the one.\"\n\n \"I think I like it,\" you admit.\n\n \"Good,\" she replies. \"Then it's yours.\"\n \n \n \n Your eyes drift over the neat row of bras hanging on hooks. Clean white, classic black... and then—at the end—you spot it.\n\n Lavender.\n\n Your breath catches, just a little.\n\n It's not some flashy, lacy, look-at-me thing. Just a simple bra in that soft shade of purple. The fabric is smooth and matte, with a slightly heathered texture—like a comfy sleep shirt in bra form. The straps are plain, the cups seamless, no bows, no sparkle, nothing trying to be extra.\n\n Just lavender.\n\n Your fingers brush the fabric, almost without thinking. It's familiar in a strange way—not because you've worn anything like it before, but because the color feels like home. Something you used to scribble with crayons, pick out in art supplies, secretly wish your bedroom had more of.\n\n You pick it up gently, turning it over in your hands.\n\n \"I think...\" you start slowly, \"this is the one.\"\n\n Samantha glances over and immediately smirks. \"Of course,\" she says. \"Lavender. Because obviously.\"\n\n You blink. \"What?\"\n\n \"[name] Yoon, connoisseur of exactly one color since childhood. If it comes in lavender, he will choose it. You could be in a sword shop and still walk out with a lavender katana.\"\n\n You try not to grin, failing entirely. \"It's a good color.\"\n\n \"It's a commitment, is what it is,\" she teases. \"You've been in a lifelong relationship with lavender and you haven't even send it flowers.\"\n\n You turn the bra in your hands again, a quiet smile tugging at the corners of your mouth. \"I just like it. Always have. Maybe I always will.\"\n\n Her expression softens—just a little. \"I know.\"\n\n You pull the bra on, the lavender fabric cool and soft against your skin. The band fits snug around your ribs, the straps resting gently on your shoulders. The color makes your skin look softer, somehow.\n\n You adjust it slightly, step back, and take yourself in.\n \n It looks like it was always supposed to be there.\n\n Samantha whistles under her breath. \"Okay, okay. Alright. I can see the vision. That's kinda perfect, I can't lie.\"\n\n You glance at her through the mirror. \"Yeah?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" she says, crossing her arms. \"Lavender strikes again.\"\n\n You look back at the mirror, the color framing you like a quiet affirmation. The color doesn't hide you, change you, or explain you.\n\n It just fits.\n \n \n \n You spot it pretending not to be the most dramatic thing on the table.\n\n A lacy black bra.\n\n You pick it up slowly, holding it by the straps like you've just discovered something disgusting. The cups are trimmed with floral lace, semi-sheer at the top, soft fabric below. It's the kind of bra you'd expect to see in a moody perfume ad or on a mannequin with opinions about jazz.\n\n You blink. \"Is this... for real?\"\n\n From the bench, Samantha perks up like a meerkat. \"Oh. You picked that?\"\n\n You glance at her. \"I didn't say I'm picking it. I just... grabbed it.\"\n\n She leans forward, elbows on her knees, grinning like she's already writing your eulogy. \"That's not a bra, [name]. That's a statement. That's the kind of bra that has an ex's name blocked in its phone.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but your thumb keeps brushing over the lace. It's softer than you expected. Not itchy or stiff—just light, like a whisper. The black is deep and rich, the kind of color that doesn't ask for attention so much as assume it.\n\n \"You're gonna put that on and instantly start speaking in metaphors,\" Samantha continues. \"People will ask you how your day's going and you'll be like, 'The moon was cruel today.' You'd give off Aurora vibes.\"\n\n You laugh despite yourself. \"It's just a bra.\"\n\n \"No,\" she says, completely serious now. \"It's the moment. It's power. It's nighttime elegance. It's... slightly intimidating, and I love that for you.\"\n\n You shake your head, but you're already getting ready to put it on. There's a strange thrill building in your chest—not fear, exactly, but the sense that you're about to cross some invisible line and discover something on the other side.\n\n You ease the bra on carefully, adjusting the band behind your back and letting the straps slide into place. The lace lies smooth across your skin, the sheer fabric showing just enough to feel... bold. The underlayer holds just enough—gentle, not rigid.\n\n You glance up at the mirror.\n\n And freeze.\n\n The person staring back looks like they have secrets. Not the kind you hide, but the kind you choose to keep. There's something darkly elegant about the black lace, the contrast against your skin, the way it shifts how you carry yourself without even trying.\n\n Samantha lets out a low whistle. \"Welp. I'm intimidated.\"\n\n You smile, slow and a little stunned. \"It actually fits. Like, really fits.\"\n\n \"Of course it does,\" she says, leaning back, satisfied. \"That bra didn't pick you. You picked each other.\"\n\n You give her a look.\n\n She shrugs. \"Let me have my moment. This is a pivotal coming-of-age moment.\"\n\n You turn back to the mirror, hands resting lightly on your hips. The bra hugs you in a way that feels intentional—not about hiding, or passing, or even survival.\n\n It just feels like something you chose. And for now, that's more than enough.\n \n\n \n \n \n You reach for the white bra.\n\n It's the most neutral of the bunch—plain, seamless, and soft. The kind of thing you could wear and forget it's even there. No color to read into or message to send, it's just... safe. And safe feels okay right now.\n\n You unclip it and slip it on, the band fitting snugly around your ribs. It's gentle. Light. Not restrictive, just present. You glance at your reflection in the mirror and realize your body feels a little more comfortable, like it finally has permission to settle.\n\n There's no dramatic revelation or swelling music, just a soft kind of rightness.\n\n You breathe out and roll your shoulders. This, you can handle.\n \n \n \n Your fingers hover, then curl around the sleek black one. There's something about it—minimal, structured, and just a little bold. You're not sure what exactly draws you to it, but you want it.\n\n You try it on.\n\n The fabric hugs your chest firmly, but not uncomfortably. The straps feel solid. Supportive. You look at yourself in the mirror and for a second, you seem more grounded.\n\n There's a small shift in your spine, a straighter posture, and a breath that comes easier.\n\n You didn't expect this, but here you are.\n \n \n \n You hesitate over the lavender one.\n\n It's soft. Delicate, but not girly. Calm. You hold it up and it feels like something chosen—not just worn. Almost like it's for you.\n\n You slip it on.\n\n It fits perfectly—gentle and stretchy, not too tight, not too loose. The color is subtle, but undeniably there. You look in the mirror, expecting to feel awkward. But instead, you feel something close to warmth.\n\n It's not about standing out, it's about softening into yourself.\n \n \n \n Your eyes land on the lacy one.\n\n It's delicate. Floral-patterned. Slightly sheer. Something about it feels like stepping off a ledge and trusting the ground will rise up to catch you. You're not even sure why the hell you reach for it.\n\n Maybe it's because it scares you a little. Or maybe because it doesn't.\n\n You slip it on slowly. The lace settles across your chest. You face the mirror, expecting to feel ridiculous. But you don't.\n\n You actually, somehow, feel pretty.\n\n For a moment, you stop bracing against yourself. You just exist.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Bra shopping begone!]",

      "text": "As you step into Blink + Shine, it's like crossing an invisible border into a parallel dimension—one where everything is soft, glowy, and smells faintly like peach gummies. The lighting is gentle and warm, like its designed to make you feel pretty just for existing. Even the floor seems to muffle your footsteps, like the store is trying not to startle you. Everywhere you look, there are racks of neatly spaced chiffon blouses, high-waisted trousers in pastel shades, ruffled skirts, and gauzy cardigans.\n\nSamantha comes to a halt two steps behind you, arms crossed, jaw already tense.\n\n\"What is this place?\" she says flatly.\n\nYou glance back at her.\n\n\"No, seriously? Is this a dream? Did we die? Did we walk into a marshmallow-themed afterlife?\" Her eyes flick across the boutique, settling warily on a display of hairbands arranged like macarons. \"There's not a single hoodie in sight. That's a bad sign.\"\n\nThe two of you linger just inside the entrance for a beat, your ears adjusting to the soft ambient music.\n\n\"Well, I think it's kind of nice,\" you offer, looking around.\n\nSamantha gives you a skeptical look, then turns back to the clothes. \"Nice if you're into floaty pants and shirts that look like you cry during poetry readings.\"\n\nYou gesture to a nearby rack of button-downs. \"Maybe you just have to look a little harder.\"\n\n\"I'd have to tear the store apart to find something in here I'd wear.\" Her tone isn't cruel, just tired. \"Like, no offense, but half of this stuff looks like it'd fall apart if you made eye contact with it too aggressively.\"\n\nYou smother a laugh. Samantha moves forward anyway, slow and cautious, like she's waiting for a wall of floral perfume to slam into her. Her hands stay stuffed into her pockets as she sidesteps a display of color-coordinated ballet flats.\n\nA soft, glittery shimmer catches your eye from across the boutique. There's an entire wall of accessories near the back, glowing faintly under the lighting.\n\n\"I might just check out the accessory wall,\" you say, already starting in that direction.\n\nSamantha sighs like she's being forced into a rom-com makeover montage. \"You do that, [name]. I'll... stand here and pretend I'm girly enough for this store.\"\n\nYou glance over your shoulder. \"You don't have to come with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm coming. Someone has to supervise you, after all. I promised to help you shop, I'm following through with it.\"\n\nThe two of you inch closer toward the accessories section. Samantha keeps her arms crossed tightly, like if she relaxes even a little, the store will convert her into someone who wears skirts and blouses.\n\n\"I swear to God, if anything in this corner tries to sparkle at me, I'm leaving you here to fend for yourself,\" Samantha mutters.\n\nYou crack a grin, but your eyes linger on the accessory wall.\n\nMaybe you'll go take a look.\n\nOr maybe you won't.\n\n[Choice: Head toward the accessories]\n[Choice: Decide to leave the store]",

      "text": "You look at the accessories wall. It's a little less threatening from the rest of the store—less commitment, more possibilities. Everything's arranged in neat little rows: tiny hair clips shaped like fruit, sparkling pins, pastel scrunchies, earrings dangling from gold hooks.\n\n \"Yeah, I have to check that section out,\" you murmur, already drifting toward it.\n\n Samantha sighs with all the theatrical flair of someone being led to her doom. \"Of course you are,\" she says, arms still crossed like she's bracing for impact. \"Let it be known I followed you willingly into the Kingdom of Glitter. May history remember me fondly.\"\n\n You glance back at her.\n\n \"I'm serious,\" she continues as she trails after you. \"You ever think about how dangerous it is to put this much sparkle in one concentrated area? This much girliness? If someone opened a soda in here, the carbonated pressure would probably detonate the whole store.\"\n\n You snort. \"You good?\"\n\n \"Never been worse,\" she replies, staring dead-eyed at a bin of pink claw clips. \"Have I not been hanging out with you enough lately? I'm losing you to the soft pastel agenda.\"\n\n You roll your eyes and keep walking, but she follows close behind, eyes darting warily around like she expects to be attacked by a rogue blouse at any moment.\n\n You pick up a lavender hairtie and give it an experimental tug. You turn your attention to the little container of hair ties. Four types sit coiled like soft spirals:\n\n <ul> \n <li>A plain elastic</li>\n <li>A simple ribbon</li>\n <li>A bunny ears ribbon</li>\n <li>A scrunchie</li>\n </ul> \n\n \"I don't get how people deal with long hair,\" she mutters. \"You wash it, you dry it, you tie it, you try to make it not look like a bird nestled in it overnight—and then what? Some wind comes along and ruins it in two seconds anyway.\"\n\n You lift an eyebrow. \"You did have long hair once.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" she snaps, \"when I was a kid. And then I gained consciousness. Beanie. Short hair. Done. No tangles. No hair ties. No war crimes committed by my own scalp.\"\n\n You turn toward the wall of hair pins. There are three colors: lavender, white, and red. They're simple and understated, but kind of nice.\n\n Behind you, Samantha sighs. \"Okay, I've made peace with this selection. Kind of. Try them on.\"\n\n [Choice: Try some accessories on]\n\n \n \n \n You glance once more toward the accessories wall. All those glittering pastel trinkets and softly glowing displays. The racks of lavender hair ties. The earrings shaped like strawberries and clouds.\n\n You take exactly one step forward.\n\n And then stop.\n\n Nope.\n\n You pivot on your heel and head back toward the entrance without a word.\n\n Samantha perks up immediately. \"Wait—are we leaving? Are you leaving?\"\n\n You nod. \"Yeah. It's not really... for me.\"\n\n She exhales in exaggerated, performative relief. \"Thank God. I thought I was gonna die in there.\"\n\n You push open the door, and the second Samantha steps outside, she dramatically clutches her chest and inhales like she's been holding her breath underwater for three days.\n\n \"REAL AIR. OH MY GOD.\"\n\n You snort. \"You were in there for like five minutes.\"\n\n \"Five minutes too long,\" she gasps. \"I think I lost three years of life expectancy in that blouse cloud. Everything smelled like flowers.\"\n\n Behind you, the door swings shut with a gentle chime—so soft it feels like it's trying not to take offense.\n\n Samantha turns in a slow, theatrical circle in the mall corridor, arms spread wide. \"Look at all this neutral lighting. Look at the lack of frills. Look at the space! I could do a cartwheel if I had core strength!\"\n\n \"I don't think Blink + Shine was that bad,\" you say, though you're already feeling lighter too. Like you shook glitter off your soul.\n\n Samantha gives you a look. \"You're only saying that because you didn't make direct contact with the mannequin in the 'gentle whimsy' section. Look, you might not believe me, but I swear it tried to sell me a lifestyle blog.\"\n\n You laugh, and she grins, satisfied with herself.\n\n \"Anyway, you made the right call,\" she adds, adjusting her beanie as you both start walking again. \"That store's for people who wear cardigans and say shit like 'oopsie-daisy' when they trip. You're not ready for that level of power.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"And you are?\"\n\n She snorts. \"Please. I'd burn up like a vampire in the sun. I walked past a shelf of floral-patterned scarves and almost disintegrated on the spot.\"\n\n Samantha stretches her arms over her head and sighs.\n\n \"So,\" she says. \"Now that we've escaped the estrogen cloud, where to next?\"\n\n You don't have answer yet, but at least you're free.\n\n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

Her smile blooms the second she sees the clothes in your arms—like she's genuinely proud of your picks, like she's seen this kind of decision before and knows just how much it means.\n\n \"Ooh, good choices,\" she says, reaching for the items with a practiced ease. She scans them one by one, folding them gently. \"You'll pull them off well, I can feel it.\"\n\n You laugh, flush warming your face. \"Thanks.\"\n\n Samantha leans an elbow on the counter, letting out a loud, fake sigh. \"I just want it known,\" she says to Maya, \"that I've officially lost my best friend to the pastel abyss. First it was hairpins. Now it's high-waisted shorts and flowy dresses. Next thing you know, I'm gonna come over and there'll be scented candles, bath bombs, and a Pinterest board.\"\n\n Maya doesn't miss a beat. \"Honestly? Sounds like a glow-up to me.\"\n\n \"You are not helping,\" Samantha groans, but she's grinning as she says it.\n\n You pull out your phone and tap it against the reader. The soft ding confirms the purchase with a satisfying finality. Maya slides your receipt into the bag and then passes it across the counter.\n\n \"Thanks for trusting yourself,\" she says, quiet now, like it's just between the two of you. \"You looked good. I hope it made you feel good too.\"\n\n You meet her eyes, and you don't need to say anything. You just nod.\n\n Then you're heading toward the door, Samantha trailing behind you with the most dramatic limp you've ever seen.\n\n \"Do you feel that?\" she says as you push open the door. \"The tragedy? The betrayal? The estrogen in the air?\"\n\n You laugh.\n\n Samantha walks a few paces ahead, then spins around to face you. \"[name], just yesterday, you were a humble peasant in cargo shorts and a T-shirt. Today? A goddess in linen. I hope you're proud of yourself.\"\n\n \"I kind of am,\" you admit, smiling without trying to hide it.\n\n She groans. \"Ugh! Stop glowing! You're like a coming-of-age movie and a skincare commercial had a baby!\"\n\n \"Should I be offended or flattered?\"\n\n \"Yes,\" she says.\n\n You keep going and you feel lighter, not just because of the bag swinging at your side, but because of something else entirely. Something that feels like permission. Like maybe, just maybe, you're starting to let yourself be exactly who you are.\n\n \n You walk up to the counter with the clothes in your arms, the folded items inside feeling heavier than they should. They're not even that flashy—just a couple of things, nothing major—but now they feel like they're glowing in the bag, practically announcing themselves.\n\n Maya looks up from the register with a mellow smile and reaches for your bag. \"All set?\" she asks.\n\n You nod, tight-lipped. \"Yeah.\"\n\n She doesn't push, just scans the items quickly. \"These are cute picks. Nice touch of colors.\"\n\n You force a little smile, the kind that doesn't quite reach your eyes. \"Thanks.\"\n\n Maya slides the receipt into a bag and hands it back to you. \"Hope they treat you well,\" she says kindly. \"And thanks for stopping by.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you murmur. \"You too.\"\n\n You turn, clutching the bag a little too tight, and head for the exit. Samantha falls in step beside you immediately, no hesitation.\n\n Neither of you speaks at first.\n\n The bright hum of Blink + Shine fades as the door swings shut behind you, replaced with the colder, wider air of the mall corridor. The peach scent and soft lighting give way to the polished tile and overhead fluorescents.\n\n You don't really look at her, just keep walking, your grip still fixed on the handle of the bag like it might fly off if you let go.\n\n Samantha nudges your shoulder lightly. \"Hey. You good?\"\n\n You don't answer right away. Then, with a sigh, you mutter, \"I don't know. I just... it felt dumb. All of it.\"\n\n Samantha scoffs—not at you, but more like at the whole situation. \"Dude. You tried on a dress and didn't explode. That's a win.\"\n\n You crack the barest smirk. \"It didn't really feel like a win.\"\n\n \"No one said it had to, [name],\" she shrugs. \"I mean, not everything you try on has to be some big life-altering moment. Sometimes it's just, 'Well, that sucked,' and then you move on.\"\n\n You glance at her, eyebrow raised. \"Is that the official fashion philosophy of Samantha Rivera?\"\n\n She places a hand dramatically over her chest. \"One hundred percent. Sometimes fashion is self-discovery. Sometimes it's a near-death experience involving blush shorts. Both are valid.\"\n\n That actually gets a real laugh out of you—short and quiet, but real. You exhale and let your shoulders drop a bit. \"Thanks,\" you mutter. \"For, you know. Not making it worse.\"\n\n Samantha bumps your elbow gently. \"Hey, I'm your best friend. If anyone gets to make fun of you, it's me. But also, like... not when you look like you've just fought in an emotional gladiator pit.\"\n\n You shake your head, the corners of your mouth twitching despite yourself. \"It's not that dramatic.\"\n\n She points at your expression. \"That face says otherwise.\"\n\n \"Okay,\" you relent. \"Maybe a little dramatic.\"\n\n \"There we go.\"\n\n You walk in silence for a few more moments, the bag swinging lightly at your side.\n\n Samantha glances over and says, a little quieter, \"You don't have to figure it all out today, y'know. It's okay if it didn't feel right.\"\n\n You nod slowly. \"I know.\"\n\n \"You're not broken or weird,\" she adds. \"Just... figuring stuff out.\"\n\n You swallow the lump in your throat, surprised by how much you needed to hear that.\n\n Even though you're still not sure what you're doing, even though you feel weird and off and embarrassed by how everything turned out, you also feel a little less alone.\n\n Samantha walks beside you, like she always does.\n\n And for now, that's enough.\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

      "text": "You stand in front of the accessory mirror, the lavender hairpin resting between your fingers like it weighs more than it should. It doesn't, of course—it's barely a whisper in your grip. But your hand hesitates anyway, hovering just above your head, like you're waiting to be given permission.\n\nYou don't get any.\n\nSo you breathe in, tilt your head, and snap the pin into place.\n\nThe change is small—subtle enough you're not even sure it's visible. But it does something to your silhouette in the mirror. Softens it. Shifts it just enough that you pause, unsure what you're seeing. It's not better or worse, just... different.\n\nBehind you, Samantha lets out a long, theatrical groan.\n\n\"Oh my God,\" she says, flinging her arms out like she's been hit by wave of invisible glitter. \"It's over. You've crossed into the sparkle realm. I've lost my best friend.\"\n\nYou roll your eyes. \"It's one hairpin, Sam.\"\n\n\"One lavender hairpin,\" she corrects, voice climbing half an octave in mock horror. \"That's the gateway drug, [name]. Next thing you know, you're wearing flower crowns and watching makeup tutorials at 2 a.m.\"\n\nYou snort. \"You literally wore glitter eyeliner to the school dance once.\"\n\n\"That was different,\" she says, tossing her head. \"That was battle armor. And besides, I balanced it out with ripped jeans and, like, combat boots.\"\n\nYou turn toward the little display beside the mirror. Four types of lavender hair ties sit in a tray: a plain elastic, a soft ribbon, one with floppy bunny ears, and a plush scrunchie. You reach out, gently poking at them one by one.\n\nSamantha leans down to inspect the display like she's evaluating evidence at a crime scene.\n\n\"You planning to put your hair up with one of those?\" she asks.\n\n\"Maybe,\" you say, because you honestly don't know.\n\nShe makes a noise like a dying cat. \"Ugh. Long hair. Why would you want that kind of responsibility?\"\n\n \n \"I already have long hair,\" you remind her.\n\n \"Yeah, and I've been meaning to stage an intervention,\" she shoots back. \"You know how easy it is to live your life when you don't wake up with a tangled bird's nest on your head? You just exist. You just vibe. You throw on a beanie and call it fashion.\"\n\n You glance at her. \"You wear the same beanie like every day.\"\n\n \"Its called a signature look,\" she says. \"Learn some culture.\"\n\n \n \"I don't have long hair,\" you say. \"It's like... medium.\"\n\n Samantha snorts. \"Medium is just long that's pretending it's still low-maintenance. That stuff tangles if you breathe wrong.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"I do brush it, you know.\"\n\n \"Barely,\" she fires back. \"You need a whole hair care routine and a support group just to make that length work.\"\n\n \"You literally wear a beanie.\"\n\n \"It's called having a brand,\" she says, flicking her fingers. \"Try to keep up.\"\n\n \n \"I don't need hair ties,\" you point out, brushing your hand over your head. \"It's already short.\"\n\n Samantha gives you a dry look. \"Yeah, but you look like you keep it short for convenience. I keep mine short for the aesthetic. Huge difference.\"\n\n You snort. \"You're in a graphic tee and a beanie right now.\"\n\n \"And still somehow serving,\" she says, striking a dramatic pose. \"Minimal effort, maximum style. Meanwhile, you're out here debating hair accessories like it's a moral crisis.\"\n\n \"Maybe I'm just evolving,\" you say, shrugging.\n\n \"Then evolve faster,\" she says. \"Your final form better be iconic.\"\n \n\nYou reach down and pick up the bunny ears hair tie. You twirl it between your fingers, letting it dangle.\n\n\"I don't know,\" you murmur. \"It is kind of cute.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well,\" she mutters, glancing off to the side. \"It's not like anyone else should get to tell you what to wear, right?\"\n\nYou blink at her.\n\n\"What?\" she snaps, a little too quickly. \"I can be supportive.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" you say, still spinning the ribbon slowly.\n\n\"Just don't expect me to get matching ones,\" she says. \"My hair tie phase died in elementary school.\"\n\nYou grin. \"So you had a phase?\"\n\n\"No comment.\"\n\nYou turn back to the mirror, the ribbon still in your hand, the lavender pin glinting faintly in your hair. The shop's lighting is soft here—almost too gentle compared to the rest of the mall. There's no pressure to do anything. But there is an invitation.\n\nAnd for once, you think you might say yes.\n\n[Choice: Time to buy!]",

      "text": "You turn the little accessory over in your hands one last time—simple, small, yet somehow enough to shift something internal. Like a nudge toward a version of yourself that's been hovering just out of reach.\n\nSamantha lingers a few steps behind as you quietly head toward the counter. She doesn't say anything at first, just trails behind with her hands stuffed into her pockets like she's forced to be here. Which, to be fair, she kind of is.\n\nYou place your choices on the counter. Whatever they are, they feel like the right ones. The sales associate, Maya, appears with a practiced ease, her bracelets giving a soft clatter as she starts scanning your items.\n\nSamantha peeks over your shoulder. Her eyes flick to the counter, then to you. \"Wow,\" she says flatly. \"Look at you, [name]. Joining the ranks of the accessorized.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Is that your official review?\"\n\n\"Hey, I'm impressed,\" she says, folding her arms. \"It's nice.\"\n\nYou snort. \"Thanks?\"\n\n\"Don't let it go to your head,\" she adds, grinning. \"Next thing I know, you'll be dragging me into a store full of pastel crop tops and high heels, and that's where I draw the line.\"\n\nMaya hands you a little branded bag with your receipt tucked neatly inside. \"These'll look great,\" she says warmly. \"Sometimes small changes do the most.\"\n\nYou nod, your fingers curling around the handle. The bag crinkles softly, light in your hand—but heavier in meaning.\n\nSamantha glances at it like it might combust. \"You realize this is the most feminine bag you've ever carried, right?\"\n\nYou look down at it. \"It's paper.\"\n\n\"Yeah. But it feels like glitter,\" she deadpans. \"You carry that out of here and there's no going back.\"\n\n\"Then I guess I'm committed.\"\n\nShe throws an arm around your shoulder in exaggerated mock support. \"Godspeed, soldier. May your hair clips be strong and your inner doubt minimal.\"\n\nYou scoff, rolling your eyes, but you don't shrug her off. Her arm's warm and familiar, and for all her dramatic flair, there's a sincerity under it that you don't miss.\n\nSamantha tilts her head toward the rest of the store. Racks of soft cardigans, flowing skirts, cardigans, and carefully color-blocked displays stretch out in curated rows. Somewhere near the back, a mannequin in a cute jacket and glittery shorts is posed mid-twirl like she's living her best life.\n\n\"So,\" she says, drawing the word out like she's narrating a reality show. \"Is this the part where you power-walk out with your dignity intact, or...\"—she gestures vaguely toward the racks—\"do we see what fashion crimes await beyond the accessories zone?\"\n\nYou follow her gaze. The rest of the store suddenly feels like a different planet. The accessories wall was one thing—small, safe, optional. Clothing, though? That's bigger. You feel the weight of the moment press just a little.\n\nSamantha senses it, of course. She smirks and gives your shoulder a gentle squeeze. \"No judgment either way. I mean, if I tried any of this stuff on, I'd combust. You've seen what I wear. If it doesn't pair with a hoodie and sneakers, I don't even look at it.\"\n\nYou glance at the delicate fabrics and soft lighting again. There's a pull. A curiosity. Maybe even a spark of something more. But there's also the safety of the exit, just a few steps behind you—an escape hatch you could still take.\n\nSamantha raises an eyebrow. \"So what's it gonna be?\"\n\nYou look from the racks to the exit, and the choice sits there, waiting.\n\n[Choice: Go to the clothing section]\n[Choice: Decide to leave the store]",

      "text": "You hesitate for a beat, your eyes flicking toward the exit—toward safety, toward certainty, toward a version of yourself that didn't just buy hair accessories from a peace-scented boutique. But your hand tightens around the little shopping bag, fingers curling around the edge. And when you lift your chin, it's with just enough to surprise even yourself.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, voice quiet but clear. \"Sure. I'll take a look.\"\n\n Samantha lets out a low whistle, dragging her beanie down just a little over her forehead. \"Oh damn,\" she says. \"I was 80% sure you were gonna nope out. Respect.\"\n\n You shrug, but there's a crooked smile on your face that gives you away. \"Guess I'm full of surprises.\"\n\n Maya reappears from seemingly nowhere, like a stylish fairy godmother who works on commission. She beams, clearly pleased, and gestures with a hanger. \"This way,\" she says, already guiding you deeper into the store.\n\n Samantha falls into step beside you, casting a wary glance around the racks like one of them might try to convert her into a girly girl on the spot. \"If one of these mannequins winks at me, I'm burning this place down,\" she mutters.\n\n Maya leads you into a section lit just a little warmer than the rest, where each piece hangs with a certain amount of dignity. Not crowded, not shoved together—like the clothes are being patient. Like they're waiting for someone to notice them.\n\n \"You see, we don't really do fast fashion,\" Maya explains, pausing to smooth out the hem of a skirt. \"Everything's selected in small batches. If it's here, it's supposed to be here.\"\n\n You nod and scan the selection: a cream apron-style dress that whispers vintage, pleated skirts, blush pink shorts that catch the light, a denim skirt, and more. Each item feels like it's been invited here on purpose.\n\n Samantha squints at the shorts. \"Yo, those are shiny. You try those on, you better commit to the aesthetic. Like, bare minimum you'll need a latte.\"\n\n You snort. \"Thanks for the vote of confidence, Samantha.\"\n\n \"I'm just saying,\" she says, holding up the pleated skirt with two fingers like it might bite her. \"This stuff's like... fairycore. Do you get what I mean? If you come out in one of these and start talking about moon rituals, I'm leaving you here.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but your grip on the bag softens. Somehow, her sarcasm makes it easier. She's not judging you. She's just narrating the weirdness of it all like your reliable chaos translator.\n\n At the edge of the section, Maya hooks a few pieces onto a hangar and offers them to you. \"Fitting rooms are just over there,\" she says. \"Take your time.\"\n\n You glance over. The fitting area is cozy, even having a little bench and mirror.\n\n Samantha crosses her arms and leans against a rack of pants, clearly not planning to move. \"Alright,\" she says. \"Moment of truth. Show me your final form.\"\n\n \"What if I come out in a full dress?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n She considers it for a few seconds. \"Depends,\" she says, finally. \"Do you spin dramatically? Because that would definitely earn bonus points.\"\n\n Maya chuckles as she walks off, giving you space. \"I'll be at the front if you need sizes,\" she calls over her shoulder.\n\n You breathe in and put one foot in front of the other. The door is right there, and now it's all up to you.\n\n \n \n There may be issues with clipping and certain assets not fitting. Please understand!\n \n\n [Choice: Try some stuff on]\n\n \n You take one last glance at the rows of feminine clothing—not harshly, just enough to make it real.\n\n \"Not today,\" you murmur.\n\n \"Bold choice,\" she says, grinning. \"Live to fight another day, huh?\"\n\n Maya, still behind the counter, doesn't miss a beat. She offers a warm smile, not the retail kind, but the real one. \"Totally fair,\" she says easily. \"Trying things on should be at your own pace. Come back whenever. We've always got something new on rotation.\"\n\n You nod in response.\n\n You and Samantha step out out the store, and the scent of peach and perfume fades into the natural mall air, replaced by the faint whir of escalators and some distant pop remix playing from a speaker. Blink + Shine's pink-and-gold signage stays lit behind you like it's gently judging your life choices.\n\n Samantha gives the storefront a theatrical, dramatic glance over her shoulder.\n\n \"Goodbye, sweet princess boutique,\" she intones in a fake-tearful voice. \"He wasn't ready for your cute skirts.\"\n\n You snort. \"Do you hear yourself when you talk?\"\n\n \"Unfortunately, yes,\" she replies brightly. \"It's a burden I bear with style.\"\n\n You shake your head, but there's a smile tugging at your mouth as the two of you merge back into the steady flow of shoppers. And even though you didn't try on any clothes, you feel like you made the right call.\n\n At least for today.\n\n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

      "text": "<<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You hear the door's soft click as it closes behind you, sealing you into a hushed little world of your own. Inside the dim fitting room, everything feels gentler—like someone paused the noise outside just for this moment.\n\n On the bench lies your selection: a clean white tank top, an oversized soft sweater, and a cute blue skirt. There are a few other pieces still on their hangers—they send a flutter of anticipation through your chest.\n\n You sit down, your hand lingering over the sweater, feeling its weight and texture. It hums with possibility. You begin changing deliberately—the tank top slides on easily, snug but soft. The sweater settles itself just right on your shoulders. You slip into the skirt, and something settles in your chest—a careful calm that feels... correct.\n\n You step toward the mirror and freeze for a moment. It's not unease—it's wonder. The reflection isn't someone else. It's you, clearer and more honest than ever. Like static faded, and a deeper melody emerged.\n\n You do a little spin, enough to let the skirt flutter around your legs, and laugh—light and surprised. Your hands smooth the front, then adjust the folds, then smooth again. Not from doubt, but because you like this feeling. So much that your breath warms and settles in your ribs.\n\n Beautiful.\n\n You realize the word fits you now.\n\n You can't help but smile. Not the nervous, halfway kind you've been doing a lot lately. This one is quiet but whole.\n\n You stay like that for a second longer than necessary. Just... looking.\n\n Then, slowly, you change back.\n\n As you fold the clothes you won't be buying and hang the ones you will back on your arm, your fingers tremble slightly—not with uncertainty, but with something close to joy. You open the door.\n\n Samantha is leaning against the wall just outside like she's been waiting for hours instead of minutes. She looks up as the door creaks open and takes you in with one quick glance.\n\n \"So?\" she asks, scanning your face. \"What happened in there? Did you find inner peace? Transcend gender? Join a cottagecore cult?\"\n\n You just smile.\n\n It must say everything, because her eyebrows shoot up. \"Oh no,\" she mutters, backing up a step in genuine horror. \"No. Nooo. I've lost him. He's gone. My best friend—stolen by ruffles and soft lighting.\"\n\n You're already walking past her, the pile of clothes in your arms, but she follows, throwing an arm over her eyes like a widow in mourning. \"I'm gonna have to learn how to braid hair. I'm gonna have to start talking about skincare routines. I'm gonna have to buy a second beanie just to emotionally cope with this devastating news—\"\n\n You laugh, actually laugh, and she stops mid-lament to grin. \"Was it worth it, though?\"\n\n You nod once. \"Yeah. Really worth it.\"\n\n She sighs dramatically. \"I knew it. Girlypop wins again.\" Then she nudges you toward the counter. \"Go on, Princess. Let's seal your fate.\"\n\n \n You push the fitting room door closed behind you—it clicks shut, cutting out Blink + Shine's gentle bubblegum pop. Here, under the harsh fitting-room lights, it's just you and the clothes.\n\n You glance down at what you're about to try on, resting neatly on the bench: a white tank top, an oversized sweater, a cute blue skirt—and a few other things that make your heart race. They should be safe and unthreatening. They're just pieces of fabric, after all. But as you pull on the tank top, you feel a familiar tension anchor in your chest—the question: Is this really you?\n\n You catch your reflection as the fabric settles on your shoulder, heart twisting slightly. The clothes fit—shoulder seams sit right, the cut flatters, the fabric flows. You're not hiding in them. But there's still distance between you and the person in the mirror.\n\n You stand straighter, arms folding across your chest like armor. Try your best to mimic confidence. Tilt your chin. Exhale. But every pose feels rehearsed. Distant. And inside, the question still churns: \"What am I even doing?\"\n\n You switch to another skirt. Tug it on, smooth the fabric over your waist and hips, step back. It looks... fine. But still wrong. Wrong enough to make your throat tighten.\n\n There's no panic, no disgust. Just a slow, hollow well of disappointment. You really wanted this to work—and you tried it. But that doesn't make it click.\n\n You strip the clothes off carefully, fold each one back just how they were, neat and patient on the bench. Then you slide into your familiar top. It doesn't feel incredible—it just feels right. Unremarkable, but you. That's enough.\n\n You pull open the door and step out.\n\n Samantha is leaning against the wall just outside like she's been waiting for hours instead of minutes. She looks up as the door creaks open and takes you in with one quick glance.\n\n You're back in the clothes you were in before you entered. Her eyes skim over your face, reading the answer before you even say a word.\n\n \"Did the pink shorts betray you?\" she asks, her tone light, but her brow is creased just slightly.\n\n You shake your head. \"More like I betrayed myself.\"\n\n She stands up straight with a little grunt, brushing off her jeans. \"Hey. You tried. That's more than most people do.\" Then, after a few seconds, \"And yeah, okay, I've got to admit those shorts were pretty cursed.\"\n\n You snort, a bit of the tension easing.\n\n Samantha gives you a look. \"Want to get something good once we head out? Escape the pastel vortex before it swallows your soul.\"\n\n You nod, grateful. And as she slings an arm around your shoulder and steers you toward the front of the store, she doesn't say anything more about the fitting room. Doesn't push. Just walks with you, like it was all just another weird little side quest.\n\n And honestly? You're glad she does.\n \n\n[Choice: Time to purchase]",

Shelves curve like waves around the store, packed to the brim with plushies: bears, bunnies, bees, dragons, dinosaurs, cats shaped like croissants, sharks with sneakers on, frogs wearing crowns. There's no real order—just magic.\n\n\"Okay,\" Samantha says, pausing just past the entrance. \"This place is... aggressively cute.\"\n\nShe's not wrong.\n\nSamantha walks past a shelf of bug-eyed seals and pokes one in the stomach. It squeaks.\n\n\"Oh my God,\" she mutters, withdrawing her finger like it betrayed her. \"They have sound effects. We're in too deep, [name].\"\n\nYou pass a shelf stacked with tiny, palm-sized octopuses, each with a mood face on either side. Samantha picks one up, flips it inside out, then flips it back.\n\n\"Look, it's me before and after finals week,\" she says, holding it up. \"See? Pure existential dread.\"\n\n\"I kind of like it,\" you state.\n\n\"Of course you do,\" she says, putting it back gently. \"You would love something that looks like it hasn't known peace since 2003.\"\n\nYou keep walking, letting your fingers graze across soft fabric tails and floppy ears. You can't help it—there's something grounding about the sheer quiet joy in the space. No one's rushing. There are kids, sure, but they're sitting on beanbags with giant frogs in their laps. One girl is whispering to what might be a smiling axolotl.\n\nYou pick up a round, blobby plush from the next shelf and squeeze it gently. It gives a faint, comforting squish, like memory foam in stuffed-animal form.\n\n\"They're really soft,\" you murmur.\n\nSamantha looks up from where she's now poking the nose of a plush walrus. \"Yeah, and scientifically engineered to make you go 'aww.' Seriously, this is emotional manipulation. You're not gonna survive this store.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"You're acting like you're immune.\"\n\nShe drops the walrus guiltily. \"I didn't say that. I'm just better at hiding it.\"\n\nYou turn the plush over in your hands, and for a second, the noise of the mall vanishes. The world is quiet. Just you and the shelves of stitched-up comfort.\n\nSamantha nods toward the display.\n\n\"Well? What's the verdict, stuffy connoisseur?\" she teases.\n\nYou glance at her, then back at the plush you're hiding. The truth is, you kind of want to talk about it. Or maybe talk about something else, but in a roundabout way, using this silly little soft thing as a buffer.\n\n[Choice: Did you have a favorite plush growing up?]\n[Choice: Which one do you think looks the most like me?]\n[Choice: Some of these are way too cute, it feels illegal]",

      "text": "You give the plush in your hands another light squeeze, then glance over at Samantha. She's still standing in front of a display, a chubby bat in one hand and a plush slice of cake in the other, eyebrows drawn together like she's genuinely weighing their merits.\n\n \"Hey,\" you say, voice a little quieter. \"Did you, uh... have a favorite plush when you were little?\"\n\n She looks up instantly, blinking like the question caught her off guard. The bat and the cake both get lowered, then dropped gently back into their cubbies.\n\n \"Oh God,\" she mutters. \"We're doing feelings.\"\n\n You smirk. \"You don't have to answer if it's that traumatic.\"\n\n \"No, no, I'm good,\" she says, waving it off. \"Just, like, give me a second to reach back into the archives. You're asking me to access the emotional vault and dust off the cobwebs.\"\n\n She wanders a few steps toward you, pretending to stretch her neck like she's cracking it for a serious memory dive.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says after a second. \"Her name was Celery.\"\n\n \"...Celery.\"\n\n \"She was a rabbit,\" Samantha says, nodding solemnly. \"Off-white. Possibly started out white, but childhood is messy. Had this little pink ribbon around her neck and one floppy ear. Not, like, designed to be floppy. One of them just... gave up.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath. \"That's actually kind of cute.\"\n\n \"I carried her around everywhere until she got so ragged that my mom tried to replace her with a new Celery,\" Samantha says, wrinkling her nose. \"But I was like, 'Nice try, I'm six, not stupid. This imposter has two functional ears and doesn't smell like me.\"\n\n \"So?\" you ask, grinning. \"What happened to her?\"\n\n Samantha shrugs, picking at the edge of a nearby display shelf. \"I think she's still somewhere in my room. In the closet, maybe. I don't know. Haven't seen her in years.\"\n\n There's a flicker of something in her expression then—softness, maybe even a little ache. But she smothers it fast and replaces it with a half-smile.\n\n \"Anyway,\" she says, clapping her hands together once, \"emotional tangent complete. Now it's your turn. What about you? Did you have some big-eared gremlin you carted around and traumatized?\"\n\n You hesitate for a second.\n\n But before you can answer, she squints at the plush you're holding and adds, \"Actually, don't tell me. Let me guess. You probably had something ridiculous. Like a dignified dinosaur in a bow tie.\"\n\n You shake your head, but you're smiling.\n\n Around you, the soft music continues, the warm light spilling through pastel displays like it's always been waiting for this exact moment.\n\n And for just a little while longer, it's okay to talk about childhood things. To imagine what it would be like to give one of these plushies a name, a place on your bed, a small piece of your attention—like you're giving something quiet and sweet back to yourself.\n\n \n You turn the plush over in your hands again, then glance sideways at Samantha. She's crouched beside another display, poking a stuffed jellyfish in the eye like it's personally offended her.\n\n You clear your throat. \"Okay, so... which one of these looks the most like me?\"\n\n Samantha pauses, mid-poke, and slowly turns to look at you. Her eyes narrow—not in judgment, but in theatrical calculation. \"Huh,\" she says, drawing the sound out. \"Dangerous question.\"\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n \"Because I could be honest,\" she says, standing up and brushing imaginary lint off her shirt. \"Or I could be mean. And you're giving me the power.\"\n\n You smirk. \"I'll risk it.\"\n\n She crosses her arms, scanning the shelves around you both like a detective studying a crime scene. \"Let's see...\"\n\n First, she grabs a round, smug-looking blobfish. She holds it up to your face, then makes a face of her own. \"Too jaded. This guy looks like he's been through three divorces and a midlife crisis.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Thanks for sparing my feelings.\"\n\n \"I'm eliminating options, genius,\" she states, dropping the blobfish.\n\n Then she lifts a tiny, grumpy-looking owl wearing a knit scarf and glasses. \"This one's tempting. You've got the whole secretly-wise, overthinking vibe. But he's blonde. You don't get to be the wise owl and have black hair. That's cheating.\"\n\n You're about to argue when she drops it back onto the shelf.\n\n She keeps moving down the row, eyes flicking over the bears and otters and things with so many sequins they might qualify as weapons. Then she freezes.\n\n \"Oh,\" she says, crouching again. \"Oh no. It's this guy.\"\n\n You follow her gaze. Nestled in the lower row of the shelf is a small plush—shaped a bit like a dumpling with legs. It's some kind of soft, fluffed-up animal—vaguely rabbit-like, but rounder. Its fur is a warm gray with a white belly, and it has short, stubby ears that flop downward in a tired sort of way. The eyes are wide and soft brown, framed by slightly raised stitching that makes it look perpetually unsure of itself. But there's something sincere in its expression, like it's trying really hard to seem fine.\n\n Samantha lifts it carefully, turning it in her hands. \"Look at him,\" she says. \"The face says 'please don't perceive me,' and the body says 'I forgot how to sit like a normal person.'\"\n\n You squint. \"That's supposed to be me?\"\n\n She grins. \"Yup. This little guy has protagonist energy, just like you. Look at that posture. That's someone who makes their own trauma worse by overthinking it.\"\n\n You blink. \"...Fair.\"\n\n She holds the plush up beside your face for comparison. \"It's uncanny.\"\n\n You laugh. \"That's harsh.\"\n\n \"He's not ugly!\" she says, squeezing the plushie gently. \"It's very you. Quiet and weirdly sincere.\"\n\n You look at the plush again, and this time, you can kind of see it. It's not flashy or edgy, it's just... gentle. A little round, a little confused, but there's a quiet sort of warmth to it. Like it's trying to be kind in a world that doesn't always make room for that.\n\n Samantha lowers her voice. \"He looks like he's still figuring stuff out. But like... he'll get there.\"\n\n You don't say anything right away.\n\n She notices. \"Sorry. Did I go too deep?\"\n\n You shake your head, still staring at the little plush in her hands. \"No. I think you nailed it.\"\n\n \n You squint at the display in front of you, a forest of round bellies and stitched smiles and suspiciously shiny button eyes. A plush stingray stares back at you from the shelf like it knows all your secrets. You lean in, then mutter, \"Some of these are way too cute. It feels illegal.\"\n\n Samantha, who's been off to the side poking what appears to be a loaf-shaped octopus, turns immediately. \"Right?\" she says, throwing both hands up. \"Like, if a middle-aged man walked out of here with three of these and no kids in sight, I'd be like, 'Sir, this is emotional smuggling.'\"\n\n You laugh. \"There's definitely something shady going on in this section.\"\n\n \"Look at this one.\" She grabs what looks like a raccoon but fluffier—its face smooshed into permanent wide-eyed alarm, its tiny paws stitched into a praying position. \"This guy definitely just saw his own price tag.\"\n\n You glance at the tag \"Twenty bucks.\"\n\n She recoils like it burned her. \"He better come with a pension plan.\"\n\n You pick up a pink creature you can't quite identify. It has antlers, wings, and what might be hooves. \"What do you think this one is?\"\n\n She peers over. \"A myth. A lie. A marketing department gone rogue.\" Then, after a beat: \"Also, adorable. I hate it.\"\n\n \"Why do I suddenly want to protect it with my life?\"\n\n \"Because you've been emotionally compromised,\" Samantha says gravely. \"This store is weaponized. It preys on your childhood neglect and softens you up with beady eyes and pastel fur. It's biological warfare.\"\n\n You eye a shelf where a gang of frogs in tiny hoodies are sitting side by side, all in slightly different shades of green. \"Do you think they talk to each other at night?\"\n\n \"I think they unionized,\" she replies. \"Which is why we're only allowed to buy one.\"\n\n You pick up a chubby penguin wearing earmuffs. It's got a little embroidered snowflake on its belly and a scarf so soft it makes you pause. \"Okay, but what if I actually got one?\"\n\n Samantha shrugs, not missing a beat. \"Then I'm buying it a tiny crib and giving it your last name. We're co-parenting now.\"\n\n You laugh again, and it echoes lightly off the display shelves. Around you, the store hums with soft music and distant chatter—low enough to feel private, like this plushie zoo is its own little world. You catch yourself smiling and shake your head. \"This is ridiculous.\"\n\n \"Totally,\" Samantha agrees. Then she leans in, whispering conspiratorially: \"So... which one are you adopting?\"\n \n\n[Choice: Pick a plushie]",

      "text": "You wander a little deeper into the store, the air somehow growing even softer—like every step forward wraps you in a layer of cotton. The lighting feels gentler here, the music more of a hum than a sound, and the only real noise comes from the occasional rustle of tags or the squish of plush against plush.\n\nSamantha trails behind you at first, but quickly veers off toward a shelf of oversized plush whales wearing tiny velvet crowns. \"This store is dangerous,\" she mutters, poking one in the nose. \"I can feel my last brain cell turning to mush.\"\n\nYou laugh under your breath and make your way toward a low shelf near the back. That's where you see it.\n\nA goat plushie.\n\nIt's soft gray, with tiny twisted felt horns and hooves that look like someone stitched them lovingly at 2 in the morning. It's got a dopey, slightly crooked grin, and its little tail sticks out in a way that makes it look like it's mid-chaotic hop.\n\nYou grin without thinking. \"This guy looks like it eats paper when you're not watching.\"\n\nSamantha appears beside you, crouching to get a closer look. \"No, no, this thing eats paper and then acts like you're the problem for bringing it up.\"\n\nYou hold it up between you. \"Like you'd walk in on it halfway through a tax return.\"\n\n\"Absolutely. And it would argue that it's helping.\"\n\nYou both stare at it for another second before you gently place it back, like setting down an adorable liability.\n\nJust a few feet away, tucked into a fabric basket and looking like it's trying to stay out of the spotlight, you find a meerkat plushie. Long, lanky, little paws curled up like it's in the middle of panicking over a group project it forgot existed. The furrow in its brow makes it look permanently concerned.\n\nYou run its thumb over its back. \"This one looks like it hasn't slept in three days and thinks it made someone mad in 2016.\"\n\nSamantha crosses her arms, squinting down at it. \"That is the face of someone who's rewritten a text seven times and still didn't hit send.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Sounds personal.\"\n\n\"Just observationally accurate.\"\n\nThen, a few steps further on, you spot it—on a nearby table, nestled between two oversized sunflowers made of felt, there's a round, chubby little bee plushie. It's mostly fuzz, with tiny stubby wings that flop when you lift it, a soft yellow belly, and a stitched-on smile that radiates pure, slightly misguided optimism. The wings bounce a little when you shake it gently.\n\n\"Okay,\" you whisper. \"This one's aggressively optimistic.\"\n\nYou turn it upside down. Its stitched face stays smiling.\n\n\"This one would accidentally knock over your coffee and then offer you a flower in apology,\" Samantha says.\n\n\"It would offer you someone else's flower and then feel bad about it for a week.\"\n\nYou both fall quiet for a moment, the bee in your hands, the goat and meerkat just behind you.\n\nThree choices.\n\nAll dumb. All endearing. All perfect in their own weird, oddly specific ways.\n\nBut you're only getting one.\n\nYou glance sideways at Samantha, who's already watching you with a smirk. She doesn't say anything yet—just waits, arms crossed, like she's silently enjoying how wrecked you look trying to decide which chaotic creature speaks to your soul the most.\n\n \n<<if [money] > 19>> \n [Choice: Get the goat plushie]\n [Choice: Get the meerkat plushie]\n [Choice: Get the bee plushie]\n \n[Choice: Decide against getting a plushie]",

      "text": "You hold the bee in your hands a second longer than you mean to.\n\n It's soft in that perfect, squishy way—firm enough to hug back, but yielding like it's already memorized the shape of your arms. Its stitched little eyes are slightly uneven, one antenna bent just a bit more than the other. It looks up at you like it's waiting. Like it knows it might be chosen. Like it's ready to go home with you and never ask why it took this long.\n\n You run your thumb along its plush belly once. Twice. Then set it down.\n\n Carefully.\n\n Like you're apologizing.\n\n Samantha catches the motion. You don't even need to look at her to feel the shift in her expression.\n\n \"You're really not getting one?\" she asks. Not teasing. Not mocking. Just... checking.\n\n You shake your head. Try to keep it casual. \"I don't need it.\"\n\n The words sound too final, even as you say them. They land like a door clicking shut.\n\n \"Right,\" Samantha says slowly. \"Not a need. Just a dumb little round bee that wanted to come home with you.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath, but it's the brittle kind. \"I mean, it's not like I'm five.\"\n\n \"No,\" she agrees. \"You're not. Which is exactly why you should be allowed to buy a plushie without acting like you need to justify it in front of Congress.\"\n\n You glance back once.\n\n The bee is still there—slumped a little to the side, wings folded like it got tired waiting. One of the sunflowers beside it leans just enough to cast a soft shadow across its face. It shouldn't feel like rejection. It shouldn't feel like anything.\n\n But it does.\n\n And it's not just the bee.\n\n You pass the goat again—the one with the off-kilter grin and tiny felt hooves that looked like it belonged in detention for crimes committed against homework and table legs. It was still sitting exactly where you left it. Like it didn't move. Like it didn't hope.\n\n The meerkat, too—long-limbed and nervy, face frozen in that perfect anxiety-ridden panic. It looked like it wanted to whisper something to you. Something quiet. Something like, \"Take me with you. Please. Just me.\"\n\n And you left them all behind.\n\n You look down at your empty hands.\n\n Your chest feels a little too hollow for how crowded the store is.\n\n Samantha moves to your side, arms crossed loosely, but there's no smirk on her face this time. \"You know, you've had to carry a lot lately,\" she says, softer now. \"Like, actual stuff. Emotional junk. Body changes. Existential weirdness. You've been juggling identity like it's part of your class schedule.\"\n\n She nudges your arm lightly. \"You could've let a cute plushie carry one percent of that. Maybe just for tonight.\"\n\n You don't respond.\n\n Because you know she's right. And also because it's already too late. You're already turning, already walking toward the exit. Already letting the soft warm air of Cuddle Creations fall behind you like a missed opportunity.\n\n Your hands are empty, and that hurts.\n \n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]\n\n \n \n \n You cradle the goat plushie in your arms, his stubby little hooves resting against your top like it's making itself at home. He's soft in the way old blankets are soft—slightly worn, warm in places he shouldn't be, and kind of judgmental. His lopsided grin stares up at you with unapologetic smugness. Like he knows he's getting adopted and thinks it's about time.\n\n The felt horns curve unevenly on his head, and one of his ears flops out stubbornly, as if refusing to participate in society. You squeeze it lightly, and something in your chest settles.\n\n It's not even a question. He's coming with you.\n\n Samantha steps up beside you, tilting her head at the goat. \"Oh good. You found the one that looks like he's got unpaid parking tickets and no regrets.\"\n\n You glance down. \"He's got strong 'public nuisance' energy.\"\n\n \"[name], he looks like he owns a trench coat and sells bad prophecies behind the mall dumpsters,\" she continues, arms crossed. \"Like one of those goats who tell you your destiny for five bucks then just fucking bite you.\"\n\n \"Samantha, I already love him, you don't have to sell him to me,\" you respond, smirking.\n\n Samantha sighs with exaggerated pain. \"Of course you do. You would bond with the unhinged-looking one.\"\n\n She pauses, then adds, a little more softly, \"He's weird. But he's also kinda... you.\"\n\n You don't say anything to that. You just hold the goat a little closer as you head to the register.\n\n A store clerk with glittery nails lights up the second they see what you're holding.\n\n You make your way to the counter, goat in tow, and are immediately greeted by a cheerful employee wearing glittery nail polish and a name tag that reads Jenn.\n\n \"Oh my God!\" Jenn exclaims, lighting up the moment she sees your choice. \"You picked Grumble Goat! That one's part of our limited run. We call him Grumble because he always looks like he's about to cancel a company meeting with zero notice.\"\n\n You look down at the goat's perma-frown and nod. \"Yeah. That tracks.\"\n\n Jenn begins scanning the tag, then gestures toward a pastel kiosk nearby. \"And now you get to do the best part—name him! It prints out a little adoption certificate. Official and everything.\"\n\n You blink at the screen. \"You're serious?\"\n\n \"Oh yeah,\" Jenn says brightly. \"Once it's printed, it's canon.\"\n\n \"I hope you're ready for this level of responsibility,\" Samantha mutters from beside you. \"You're basically becoming a single parent.\"\n\n \"I'm not naming him Steve,\" you warn.\n\n \"I'd disown you if you did,\" she says, deadpan. \"This goat has cursed-object energy. You can't name him something normal. He deserves something dramatic and slightly suspicious.\"\n\n You turn to her. \"Suggestions?\"\n\n She taps her chin, mock thoughtful. \"Hmm. Baron Von Paperchewer. Or maybe... Sir Misbehaves-a-Lot.\"\n\n You stare.\n\n \"What?\" she says. \"You brought this upon yourself.\"\n\n You look back at the goat. His dumb, perfect face dares you to commit. To make it official.\n\n You reach for the keyboard.\n\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n \n \n You hold the little meerkat plushie in your hands, its paws curled nervously to its chest, stitched eyes wide like it's constantly apologizing for something it didn't even do. It's the kind of expression that says \"I'm just happy to be here, but also deeply stressed about it.\" Something in you softens. You don't know why, but you feel like you get this thing. Or maybe, it gets you.\n\n Samantha drifts up beside you, peering at the meerkat like she's sizing it up for crimes.\n\n \"Oh no,\" she says flatly. \"That little guy's definitely been emotionally devastated by having to talk to others.\"\n\n You smirk. \"He looks like he triple-checks his text messages before sending 'k.'\"\n\n Samantha nods solemnly. \"He's in a permanent state of rehearsing fake conversations for real interactions.\"\n\n \"He'd panic over picking a snack and then just get the same one he always does,\" you say, cradling the plushie a little closer.\n\n \"That's depressingly accurate,\" she says, and then adds, \"I like him.\"\n\n \"You like him because he's neurotic.\"\n\n \"No,\" Samantha says, leaning in to boop the meerkat's nose. \"I like him because he's neurotic and loyal.\"\n\n You laugh, the sound easing out of you before you realize how tightly you'd been holding your breath.\n\n You carry him gently to the front counter. The cashier spots you and lights up immediately.\n\n \"Ooh, someone picked a PeekPal!\" she says, grinning wide. Her name tag—Jenn—glitters under the warm lights.\n\n \"A Peek-what?\" you ask.\n\n Jenn turns the meerkat slightly, revealing a small woven tag near its hind leg: PeekPal Series — For The Quiet Kind of Brave.\n\n \"They're part of a new line,\" Jenn explains as she scans the barcode. \"Designed for people who overthink everything but still show up for the people they care about.\"\n\n You blink down at the meerkat. You think of the way he seemed to hide behind the other plushies, how his brow was slightly furrowed in stitched worry, how he felt just right when you picked him up. That familiar kind of anxious hopefulness you yourself have felt too many times before.\n\n \"He looks like he's emotionally exhausted but refuses to go to bed,\" Samantha mutters beside you.\n\n Jenn giggles. \"Exactly! He's from the 'Cautious but Courageous' set.\" She gestures to a glowing kiosk off to the side. \"Anyway, you can make it official over there. Comes with a certificate and everything. You're basically adopting a tiny plushie full of anxiety and love.\"\n\n You cradle the meerkat a little tighter. His fur's soft against your fingertips, and somehow, just being in your arms makes him seem a little less on edge.\n\n Samantha watches you for a second, then says, \"Just make sure you pick a name that won't give him a full identity crisis, okay?\"\n\n \"No promises,\" you murmur.\n\n The kiosk pulses gently, the screen lit in soft pastels. Name Your PeekPal flashes across the top.\n\n You take one last glance down at your new nervous friend, who stares back with that same uncertain but hopeful gaze.\n\n Samantha leans over your shoulder. \"I swear if you name him something like 'Dave', I'm leaving you here.\"\n\n You don't answer.\n\n You just smile and start typing.\n\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n \n \n The bee plushie's still where you left it—perched between two felt sunflowers like it's posing for a yearbook photo it didn't know would be permanent. Its fuzzy yellow belly practically glows under the warm lighting, stubby little legs poking out like it's bracing for impact. The soft felt wings wobble as you pick it up again, and its stitched-on smile somehow manages to look both enthusiastic and deeply uncertain.\n\n You don't even hesitate. You reach for him like it's already yours.\n\n Something about it just clicks. He's not the biggest, or the fluffiest, or even the most detailed. But he fits perfectly into your hands. Just firm enough to squish without losing shape. Just fuzzy enough to comfort without clinging. You press his little belly and imagine him sitting on your shelf, cheering you on in his tiny, high-pitched bee voice every time you sit down to work or panic about life.\n\n Samantha steps up behind you and squints at him.\n\n \"Oh, great,\" she says, folding her arms. \"You picked the one that looks like he's five minutes into a team-building seminar and already regretting his whole life.\"\n\n You laugh. \"I mean... yeah. But he'd still hand out the icebreaker cards.\"\n\n She flicks one of the bee's felt wings gently. \"He's definitely the guy who says, 'I think we're all doing great!' while dying inside.\"\n\n \"He's doing his best,\" you say, holding him closer.\n\n \"Which makes two of you,\" she replies with a smirk. \"Alright, I guess he's kinda cute. In that helpless intern sort of way.\"\n \n You gently squeeze the bee one more time, and there's something satisfying about how he bounces back—like he's always going to try, even when he's overwhelmed. Maybe especially then.\n\n At the counter, Jenn—a bright-eyed employee with a glittery name tag—lights up the moment she sees what you're holding.\n\n \"Ohh! BuzzBuddy alert!\" she exclaims. \"I love those guys.\"\n\n You blink. \"That's a real category?\"\n\n \"Yep! Part of our Support Squad line,\" Jenn says, already reaching for the scanner. \"BuzzBuddies are for folks who try real hard, spiral a little, and still show up anyway.\"\n\n Samantha leans in and nods like she's judging a wine. \"A bold choice. Strong notes of people-pleasing and barely contained anxiety.\"\n\n Jenn finishes scanning the tag and then gestures toward the kiosk. \"Alright! Time for the best part—his name. Gotta make it official.\"\n\n The screen glows a soft honey yellow, little sparkles drifting behind the blinking cursor. The prompt reads: Name Your BuzzBuddy.\n\n You walk over, cradling the bee in your arm. He stares up at the screen with his stitched-on smile like he's about to encourage you to do your best.\n\n Samantha peeks over your shoulder. \"What if you named him something absurd?\"\n\n You snort. \"I think he deserves better than that.\"\n\n \"Oh, I agree,\" she says, nudging you lightly with her elbow. \"But you know he'd answer to literally anything if you said it with confidence.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but the smile on your face won't go away.\n\n Your fingers hover over the screen.\n\n He's waiting.\n\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "You stand before the kiosk, fingers hovering just above the touchscreen. The goat plushie is nestled in your arm, smug little face tilted like it's already judging your typing skills. You take a breath, then start typing.\n\n The name lights up on the screen: [goatplushieName].\n\n A chime dings, and animated goat confetti bursts across the display—little cartoon hooves and horns in exaggerated majesty. You crack a smile, a real one. It's ridiculous. But also kind of perfect.\n\n \"Oh, good,\" Samantha says behind you, her arms crossed and eyebrows raised. \"You gave him a decent name. I was worried you were going to go with something stupid.\"\n\n You glance back at her. \"[goatplushieName] has gravitas.\"\n\n \"He has a file over at the IRS, is what he has,\" she mutters, smirking. \"Look at him. That's a goat who embezzles.\"\n\n Before you can respond, Jenn leans forward with theatrical flair. \"[goatplushieName]! Lovely choice. Mischievous. Mysterious. A little chaotic. We love to see it.\"\n\n She hits a few buttons, and the screen spins around to face you again. On it, in a playful font:\n\n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, [goatplushieName]!\n\n A digital badge appears beneath it that says \"Certified Goofball.\"\n\n You snort.\n\n \"Honestly?\" Samantha says, squinting at the screen. \"That little badge? You should put that on your resume.\"\n\n Jenn gestures toward a soft pastel podium with a build-in printer, and a gentle hum begins. A small certificate emerges from the slot, printed on cream-colored cardstock with a faint shimmer.\n\n Jenn presents it like its sacred. \"One official Certificate of Adoption.\"\n\n You take it carefully and read:\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that [goatplushieName], a Goat of Great Personality and Questionable Impulse Control, has been lovingly adopted by [name] on this day. May your hugs be strong, your snacks be shared, and your secrets be safe.\n\n Samantha reads over your shoulder. \"Wow. I didn't know the goat came with a legal document binding you to emotional intimacy.\"\n\n You gently slip the certificate into the tote Jenn hands over—white canvas with a little sleeping moon curled around a teddy bear stitched on the front.\n\n Jenn carefully tucks [goatplushieName] in with soft tissue, making sure his horns don't get squished. \"Take good care of him,\" she says, lowering her voice a little like it's a secret. \"He's one of our favorite troublemakers.\"\n\n \"Don't worry about that,\" you say, hugging the bag to your chest. \"I'll take the very best care of him.\"\n\n \"Congrats,\" Samantha says as the two of you head toward the store's exit. \"You've adopted a goat with more personality than half our school.\"\n\n You glance down at the tote, [goatplushieName]'s crooked grin peeking through the folds.\n\n And as the two of you walk back into the heart of the mall, you feel it—light, stupid, warm—like you really did just make space for something that matters.\n\n Even if it's just a very questionable goat.\n\n \n You take a breath. Not because it's hard—but because something about this feels... permanent. Or at least important in a way you don't want to mess up.\n\n Your fingers hover over the pastel keyboard. You type the letters one by one.\n\n [meerkatplushieName].\n\n The kiosk dings like it's proud of you. Yellowish confetti bursts across the screen with cartoon flair, and a nervous little animated meerkat peeks out from behind a digital cactus, blinking up at you like he's just now realizing he exists.\n\n \"Ugh,\" Samantha groans beside you, but there's a smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. \"That's so sweet it's giving me a toothache.\"\n\n Jenn leans in dramatically. \"[meerkatplushieName],\" she whispers like it's a secret spell. \"That name fits. Not that I'm allowed to say anything legally binding, but—he looks like he journals.\"\n\n You glance down at the plushie in your hands. His soft little body presses into your chest like he's trying to be smaller than it is. You smile before you even know you're doing it.\n\n Jenn taps a few more keys and spins the screen around.\n\n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, [meerkatplushieName]!\n\n A digital badge appears beneath it that says \"Overthinker, Hug Magnet, Snack Enthusiast.\"\n\n Samantha peers at the screen and raises an eyebrow. \"Honest? That might as well be your bio.\"\n\n Jenn gestures to a small podium where a soft hum is already whirring from the printer. \"Let's make it official.\"\n\n A certificate slides out on cream-colored paper, slightly textured and—somehow—scented faintly like vanilla frosting. Jenn lifts it reverently, holding it out like it's a diploma.\n\n You take it gently.\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that [meerkatplushieName], a proud member of the PeekPal Series, has been lovingly adopted by [name] on this day. Though he lives in constant fear of loud noises and minor inconveniences, he will show up, be brave, and offer his tiny paws anyway. Provide snacks often. Encouragement always.\n\n You try not to laugh. But something about it makes your chest warm. It's like this moment knows exactly what it's doing.\n\n Samantha leans over your shoulder, reading aloud in a whisper, \"Offer his tiny paws anyway...\" Then she pauses and grins. \"This little guy's going to destroy you emotionally, isn't he?\"\n\n Jenn wraps the meerkat in soft yellow tissue, careful not to bend the ears. She seals it with a round sticker that reads: \"He's safe now.\" Then she tucks him into a tote bag printed with the Cuddle Creations logo—an adorable bear sleeping inside a crescent moon.\n\n As she hands the bag over, Jenn smiles and leans in slightly. \"He's the kind that needs a lot of reassurance. But something tells me you've got that covered.\"\n\n Samantha grabs the handles before you can, then lifts the bag between you like she's weighing it. \"This thing's radiating codependent energy. You two are gonna get along great.\"\n\n You carefully slide the certificate into the tote, smoothing the corners so it doesn't crumple.\n\n Then, together, you step out of the store—back into the mall's warm lights and distant chatter. Samantha glances sideways at you as you walk.\n\n \"[meerkatplushieName]?\" she says, in mock disbelief. \"Really?\"\n\n You nod once, still smiling.\n\n \"Eh. I guess it fits,\" Samantha says, shrugging. \"Well, I guess congratulations are in order. You're not a proud parent to a stress ball with eyes.\"\n\n And with that, the two of you melt into the flow of the crowd, a plushie tucked under your arm and something softer settling in your chest.\n\n \n You take a breath and rest your fingers on the screen, just for a second, letting the moment sit. Then you start to type: [beeplushieName].\n\n The kiosk responds with a cheerful ding, and suddenly the display bursts to life. Animated bees zip across the screen in loops, tiny sparkles trailing behind them. One smacks into a cartoon daisy and does a slow-motion spin before wobbling upright again. It's all so charmingly over-the-top that you can't help but smile.\n\n Jenn lets out a delighted gasp. \"[beeplushieName]! Ugh, that is so sweet I think I just got a cavity,\" she says, practically bouncing on her heels.\n\n Samantha, peeking over your shoulder, rolls her eyes but doesn't bother hiding her grin. \"I mean, it's something,\" she teases.\n\n You glance down at the bee, still nestled in the crook of your arm. He looks completely unbothered. Loyal. Cheerful. Probably humming a motivational jingle in his head.\n\n Jenn gives a few final taps, and then swivels the screen around dramatically.\n\n Welcome to the Cuddle Creations Family, [beeplushieName]!\n\n A digital badge appears underneath: \"Certified Encouragement Specialist – Level 1 Buzz\"\n\n Samantha leans in. \"Level one? Wow. So humble. He's just here to buzz supportively while the world burns.\"\n\n You snort, clutching the plushie a little closer.\n\n Jenn beams. \"Okay, time to make it official!\"\n\n She leads the two of you over to a curved little podium where a soft whirring starts. The printer behind it buzzes quietly, then gently slides out a creamy slip of thick, textured paper with gold lettering and a delicate floral trim.\n\n Jenn picks it up with care and hands it over like it's something precious.\n\n Certificate of Adoption\n This certifies that [beeplushieName], proud member of the BuzzBuddy Support Squad, has been lovingly adopted by [name] on this day. Though he is often overwhelmed and mildly vibrating with panic, he will always try his best, encourage those around him, and commit to emotional support with great enthusiasm. Buzz responsibly.\n\n You stare at it for a second longer than expected. There's something about it that lands differently. Something warm and ridiculous and a little bit real.\n\n Samantha peers over your arm. \"Okay, it's rude how that actually got to me. Why is a fake bee giving me emotions?\"\n\n Jenn is already wrapping the plushie in soft yellow tissue paper dotted with little white daisies. She nestles him gently into a sky-blue Cuddle Creations tote bag, its front stamped with a sleepy moon curled around a bear.\n\n She nudges the bag forward with a wink. \"Take good care of him. He's got a lot of feelings and no idea where to put them.\"\n\n Samantha folds her arms, watching you slip the certificate into the tote. \"So, like you, then.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"He's way more optimistic than I am.\"\n\n \"You know what?\" she says. \"That's true.\"\n\n You shake your head, unable to stop the small smile forming on your lips.\n\n As you both step out into the mall again, you adjust the tote bag's strap over your shoulder. The weight of it is nothing—but still, it feels like something's settled. Something small, and silly, and good.\n\n Samantha glances at you. \"So. [beeplushieName], huh?\"\n\n You shrug lightly. \"He just... felt right.\"\n\n She doesn't tease this time. Just smirks softly, tugs your sleeve a little, and says, \"Yeah. I get that.\"\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

It's stylish without being showy, like trendy doesn't need to shout.\n\nThe second you step into NovaTrend, it feels like you've crossed some invisible threshold from the messy, fluorescent mall chaos into the curated, ultra-clean world of a fashion influencer's closet.\n\nSamantha makes a disgusted face. \"Oh nooooo,\" she drawls, dragging out the syllables like she's narrating a slow death. \"You would pick NovaTrend.\"\n\nYou glance back at her. \"What's wrong with NovaTrend?\"\n\n\"Dude, what's right with NovaTrend?\" she retorts, gesturing to a display of sweaters folded like origami. \"Everything in here looks like it comes with a personality quiz and a [12] coffee order. This place is, like, if Pinterest got gentrified.\"\n\nYou laugh under your breath. \"You could've waited outside.\"\n\n\"I could've,\" she agrees. \"But then who would make sure you don't accidentally walk out looking like Jessica?\"\n\n\"What's wrong with Jessica?\" you ask.\n\nBefore she can respond, a staff member approaches. They have an effortless bounce that suggests they've worn every piece in the store twice already. Their name tag reads \"Elle (they/them)\" and they catch the hesitation in your body language instantly. \"Hey there! Welcome to NovaTrend. Looking for anything in particular today?\"\n\nYou hesitate, and Samantha opens her mouth, but Elle catches your eye gently and continues. \"Something casual? First-time fitting? Or just trying things out?\"\n\nYou nod. \"Just... trying stuff. New to this.\"\n\nElle gives a small, knowing nod, like they've heard that before. \"Got it. No pressure, let's just keep it easy. We have some pieces that are super soft and low-fuss. Want me to pull a few options in your size?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" you say.\n\nElle gives you a quick once-over—not judgmental, just efficient—and glides away to a nearby rack. Samantha leans over as soon as Elle's out of earshot. \"I bet even their pens have an aesthetic.\"\n\nYou snort quietly.\n\nElle returns a minute later with a small stack of clothes—nothing outrageous, just trendy pieces that seem to beckon.\n\n\"These are pretty forgiving fits,\" Elle says. \"Nothing that hugs too hard, and everything's adjustable. If you like how any of them feel, we can look at other options too.\"\n\nYou nod again. \"Thanks.\"\n\nElle gestures toward the back. \"Fitting rooms are just through there. Let me know if you need another size.\"\n\nYou head in the direction they pointed, passing displays of wide-leg trousers, trendy boots, and two mannequins posed mid-laugh, like they just heard a joke only rich people understand.\n\nBehind you, Samantha mutters under her breath, \"[name], I swear to God that one of those mannequins just judged me.\"\n\nYou roll your eyes and make your way to the fitting rooms. There, you find a calm, welcoming space: soft lights, a mirror framed gently, and a wooden bench. You hold the chosen outfits like quiet treasures.\n\nYou step inside the changing room, closing the curtain behind you. The world softens to just you, the clothes, and a mirror.\n\n[Choice: Try outfits on]",

They settle onto your frame like they were waiting. There's no awkward tugging or uncomfortable shifting. Just warmth. Just you.\n\n The skirt swishes around your legs with a light, playful motion every time you move, and the top rests gently against your chest. You do a little turn in the mirror. You don't even flinch. Instead, you smile.\n\n You like what you see.\n\n There's a quiet thrill in how natural it feels. How your shoulders relax, how your posture changes without even thinking. This isn't pretending. It's discovering.\n\n You slip back into the clothes you wore in after, slower than usual, carefully folding each item as you place it back onto the hook. Your hand lingers on the black slit skirt. You hesitate.\n\n You glance at your reflection one last time, and your heart answers before your brain catches up.\n\n I want this.\n\n You step out, cheeks warming as the soft store music greets you again.\n\n Samantha's leaning against a display table, flipping through a rack of trendy tops and looking disgusted. The second she sees you, her eyes scan your face.\n\n She blinks. Then grins.\n\n \"Well, damn,\" she says, straightening. \"Someone had a good time in there.\"\n\n You try to suppress the smile tugging at your face again, but it's useless.\n\n \"What gave it away?\"\n\n \"You're glowing, dude,\" she says, deadpan. \"Like you just got proposed to or ate the world's best pastry. Which, honestly, same emotional category.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath.\n\n She nudges your arm with her elbow. \"That outfit must've hit hard.\"\n\n You glance down at the bundle in your hands.\n\n Maybe it did.\n\n You're not sure yet what you're going to do with that feeling. Not yet. But you know it matters.\n\n And right now, you're holding onto it.\n\n \n The clothes fit. Technically.\n\n The sleeves aren't too tight, the skirt falls just right, and the soft tops don't cling in a weird way. You look... fine. Objectively speaking, maybe even kind of good. You can imagine someone else wearing them and pulling it off without blinking.\n\n But as you stare at yourself in the mirror, you feel a weird kind of distance building between you and your reflection.\n\n You tug on the collar on the cream top. Adjust the waistband of the skirt. Do a half-turn.\n\n It's not bad, but it doesn't feel like you.\n\n You want it to. You try. You picture how this would look in public. Maybe if your posture was different or if your head was clearer. You sigh, pressing your palms against the sides of your thighs. You're not disgusted, not upset. Just... disconnected. Like this is someone else's closet and you're just borrowing their role.\n\n You change back, fold the pieces, and pick them up. You hesitate for a second, then pull open the curtain.\n \n The light spills back in. The world resumes.\n\n Samantha's standing a few feet away, leaning on the wall across from the fitting rooms with her phone in one hand and a mildly annoyed expression that melts the moment she sees your face.\n\n She straightens. \"Woah. Hey. You good?\"\n\n You nod too quickly. \"Yeah. Fine.\"\n\n She narrows her eyes, studying you.\n\n \"You didn't even let me see what you tried on,\" she says, trying to keep it light, but her voice is quieter now. \"You look... I don't know. Off.\"\n\n You shrug. \"It just wasn't me.\"\n\n Samantha watches you for a second longer, the sharpness in her usual tone fading into something softer. Concern. Not the overbearing kind. Just her being present, as always.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says finally. \"You don't have to talk about it. Just... you okay?\"\n\n You nod again, slower this time. \"Yeah.\"\n\n She doesn't press. She just stands next to you, not too close, not saying anything more.\n\n You're not sure what, if anything, you'll buy.\n\n But something in you knows this wasn't really about the clothes. And maybe... maybe that's why it's so hard to decide.\n \n\n[Choice: Is there anything to buy?]",

      "text": "<<if [transgender] > 14>> \n The NovaTrend bag rustles softly in your hands as the two of you step back out into the main corridor of the mall. It's a sleek little thing—matte white with raised lettering, a splash of teal tissue paper peeking out the top like a flag declaring your quiet victory.\n\n The moment the door swings closed behind you, the mall noise floods back in—bright lights, loud voices, and someone arguing on speakerphone near the store next door. But it all feels...distant. Like you're moving through it wrapped in a thin layer of warm static.\n\n You glance down at the bag again. You keep expecting the weight in your chest to come back—like your body's going to suddenly realize what you just did and panic. But instead, you feel light. Not in the sense that you're floating away, but like you're finally not carrying something you didn't know was heavy until it was gone.\n\n Samantha, walking beside you with her sleeves pushed halfway up her arms, shoots you a look out of the corner of her eye. She doesn't say anything at first. She just smirks.\n\n \"So,\" she drawls after a beat, \"you and NovaTrend, huh? Never thought I'd lose you of all people to The Cult of Soft Tones and High-Waisted Enlightenment.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but your smile creeps back before you can stop it. \"It was... nice.\"\n\n \"Nice?\" she gasps, mock-offended. \"You looked like you were about to start singing a ballad in there. I half expected birds to fly out of the fitting room and braid your hair.\"\n\n You huff out a laugh. \"I just liked how it felt, alright? Being in the outfit.\"\n\n She stops walking for a second and turns toward you, her smirk softening into something far more sincere. \"Good. I'm glad.\"\n\n You look down at the bag again, fiddling with the handles. \"It felt like... I don't know. Like the clothes didn't argue with me. Like I wasn't trying to dress around something.\"\n\n \"That's what clothes are supposed to do,\" Samantha says, shrugging. \"You shouldn't have to fight your reflection just to feel like a person.\"\n\n You nod, and for a moment, the two of you fall into step again.\n\n She tilts her head with a sly grin. \"That top that says Symmetry on it, though? If you don't wear it next time we hang out, I'm reporting you for emotional crimes.\"\n\n \n \"I haven't even taken the tag off yet.\"\n \n \n \"I didn't even end up buying it.\"\n \n\n \"Don't care. You're wearing it.\"\n\n You laugh again, and this time it fills your whole chest.\n\n The bag swings gently at your side as you walk.\n\n Whatever comes next, whatever choices you still have to make—it's yours. And that feels good.\n\n \n The doors of NovaTrend slide shut behind you with a soft hiss and a final puff of floral-scented air. The mall greets you again with its usual overstimulating hum—brighter lights, louder voices, someone arguing on speakerphone near the store next door.\n\n You've got the shopping bag in your hand. Just one—light, matte white, with the NovaTrend logo printed in metallic foil. It rustles faintly as you walk, even though it barely weighs anything.\n\n Samantha's beside you, not saying anything yet. Which is weird. She always says something. Usually something loud, inappropriate, or deeply unserious.\n\n But now, she just watches you out of the corner of her eye as you walk.\n\n You try to beat her to it. \"I bought something.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" she says, gently. \"I saw.\"\n\n You swallow.\n\n \"It felt weird,\" you admit. \"Wearing it.\"\n\n Samantha stays quiet for a second. Then she nods. \"Yeah?\"\n\n You nod too, more to yourself. \"I don't know. Everyone talks about it like it's supposed to feel right, or euphoric, or whatever. But I just felt... wrong. I couldn't stop thinking about how I looked. Like, what if someone saw? What if I saw myself too clearly?\"\n\n Your voice dips toward the end. You're not sure why you bought what you did. Guilt, maybe. Obligation. A weird need to prove something—to yourself, to the [referto], to whatever's happening to your body.\n\n \"I thought maybe I was supposed to like it,\" you add, quieter now.\n\n Samantha stops walking. You slow down a step too.\n\n She turns to face you. \"Hey.\"\n\n You look at her.\n\n She doesn't make a joke. She doesn't roll her eyes or smirk or make it about the color of the top or the cut of the skirt. Her voice is even, steady.\n\n \"You don't have to feel a certain way just because people expect you to,\" she says. \"They're just clothes. If it didn't feel right, that's okay. It doesn't mean anything's wrong with you, or that you're doing this wrong. It just means you're figuring it out—and that takes time.\"\n\n The mall carries on around you—carts rolling, voices echoing, a pop song warbling from somewhere near the pretzel stand. But for just a moment, it feels like the world quiets around the two of you.\n\n Samantha nudges your arm gently. \"We can always go somewhere else next.\"\n\n You nod, a little slower this time. The bag rustles softly at your side.\n\n You keep walking. Together.\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

      "text": "Stepping into ShatterBox, you're hit with a wave of velvet darkness and electric energy—like a haunted mansion redesigned for alt fashion devotees. The walls are matte black, purple LED strips twisting around shelves like digital ivy, and the speakers pulse with slow, thudding bass. Posters featuring cult indie bands, surreal album art, and glitch-horror illustrations cling at odd angles, while mannequins stand in brooding poses—as if daring you to challenge them.\n\nSamantha slows beside you, her sneakers squeaking faintly on the floor as she looks around. \"Okay,\" she says under her breath. \"Why does it feel like a vampire's walk-in closet?\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Maybe that's exactly what it is.\"\n\n\"No, yeah, I'm into it,\" she says, folding her arms. \"This place has vibes. Like the kind that eat you alive if you look insecure for more than five seconds.\"\n\n\"So we should definitely split up and wander into the fog,\" you say, smirking.\n\n\"That's how people die in movies,\" she mutters, though she's already wandering toward a rack of mesh tops with fake bloodstains on them.\n\nYou're still soaking in the décor—if you can call creeping vinyl posters, looping CRT glitch videos, and a looming neon sign that says \"BITE ME\" décor—when the curtain behind the counter rustles.\n\nThen she appears.\n\nThe girl who steps out has presence. Not the kind that shouts, but the kind that sinks its teeth in. Chunky boots that hit the ground like a war drum. Fishnets, a high-waisted pleated skirt, and a shredded band tee with a skull design you're pretty sure was drawn in someone's blood. Her black lipstick is immaculate, sharp in a way that makes you wonder if she uses it as a weapon. A moon pendant larger than a toddler sits in front of her chest.\n\nShe pauses, eyes sweeping the store, landing right on you.\n\n\"You look like you're trying to convince yourself you're not into this,\" she says, voice flat but playful. \"Newsflash—people don't walk into my store by accident.\"\n\nYou blink. \"I... wasn't gonna buy anything.\"\n\nShe raises a single, skeptical brow. \"Sure, sure. Just browsing. Everyone's just browsing. Until the clothing speaks to you and then suddenly you're reevaluating your whole personality.\"\n\n\"She's got a point,\" Samantha says from behind you.\n\nThe salesgirl smiles, just a little, like she's pleased with herself. \"Come on. I'll show you something.\"\n\nShe turns, the chains on her belt jangling with every step as she leads you through the dim-lit racks and shelves. There are shirts with cryptic phrases, corsets that look like they're built for battle, and jackets that could double as armor. She walks with the confidence of someone who knows every square inch of the space and isn't afraid to test you in it.\n\n\"There was a system wipe last week,\" she says over her shoulder. \"We lost half the inventory. Corporate called it 'inventory corruption.' I call it a spiritual cleansing.\"\n\nShe stops in front of a lone display hanger like she's presenting an offering to the fashion gods.\n\n\"But this?\" she says. \"This survived. And I kept it in the back because, honestly, I didn't want just anyone getting their hands on it.\"\n\nShe pulls it forward with one hand.\n\nIt's an outfit.\n\nThe dress is black—of course—but not in a boring way. It's soft and velvety, off-shoulder with long sleeves that flare just a bit. There's a subtle lace trim along the hem, like the edge of something forgotten and romantic. A thin belt wraps around the middle, with a silver heart-shaped buckle that catches the low light just enough to sparkle. Attached to the hanger are a pair of fishnet tights, and below that—your eyes catch on the boots.\n\nPlatform combat boots. Polished black with silver buckles, thick soles, and enough presence to stomp through someone's soul.\n\n\"This one never made it to the floor,\" she says, holding it like something sacred. \"It was supposed to be scrapped. I pulled it before it got tossed. I mean, look at it. This isn't for a window mannequin. This is for someone with taste.\"\n\nSamantha takes a long look at the outfit, then slowly lets out a low whistle. \"Okay, I hate how much I like this.\"\n\n\"It's...\" you begin, laughing uncertainly. \"It's kind of intense.\"\n\n\"Dude, it's cool,\" she insists. \"It's like—'I've been through heartbreak, but make it fashion.' You'd give off Aurora vibes. People would be scared that you'd hex them.\"\n\nYou squint. \"I don't know if that's a good thing.\"\n\n\"Look, the point is that it's got aura,\" she shrugs. \"Capital A and everything. And honestly? You could pull it off.\"\n\nThe salesgirl watches you both with quiet amusement. \"She's right. You've got the bone structure for brooding, and the energy is on point.\"\n\nYou hesitate, fingers brushing the fabric. It's surprisingly soft. The dress sways a little on the hanger like it's waiting.\n\n\"I don't know,\" you say softly. \"It's not really my usual thing.\"\n\n\"Okay, and?\" Samantha says, brows raised. \"Maybe your usual thing is due for an upgrade.\"\n\nYou laugh, almost despite yourself.\n\nThe sales attendant takes the hanger from you and flips it in her hand. \"Try it. Or don't. But if you don't, I guarantee some watered-down TikTok goth wannabe is gonna wander in later and ruin its potential.\"\n\nYou sigh.\n\n\"Well?\" she asks, raising her eyebrow. \"The fitting room's open and the mirror doesn't bite.\"\n\n[Choice: Try it on]\n[Choice: Decide against wearing it]",

The lace trim brushes your knuckles—soft, weightless—and yet it sends a subtle pull through your chest. Not quite adrenaline. Not quite nerves. Something between the two. Like cracking open a door you didn't even realize was there.\n\n You glance toward the salesgirl. She's leaned against a rack now, arms crossed and one black boot resting on its heel like this is just another Tuesday. Her dark lipstick hasn't smudged a bit, but she hasn't lost her edge—but the sharpness in her expression has eased. No smug smirk, no teasing. Just a quiet, steady look that says more than words could.\n\n You swallow. \"Alright,\" you say, voice barely above the hum of the store's moody playlist. \"I'll try it.\"\n\n Her eyes gleam like moonlight catching on a knife's edge. \"Good,\" she says simply, and hands it over like she's passing you a relic meant only for the worthy.\n\n The hanger feels heavier now. Or maybe it's just the weight of the moment.\n\n Samantha watches you with a raised eyebrow. \"You're really gonna go for it?\" she asks, but there's no mockery in it. Just a hint of surprised. And maybe even a little pride.\n\n \"I mean, I'm already here, right?\" you mutter, and head toward the fitting rooms before you can talk yourself out of it.\n\n The fitting room curtain sighs closed behind you, swallowing you into a dim little pocket of space. One overhead bulb buzzes in mild protest, casting uneven shadows across the floor. A full-length mirror leans against the wall.\n\n You hang the outfit gently, then start to change.\n\n The dress slides over your shoulder like it's always known where to settle. The fabric is soft but structured; it hugs, but it doesn't cling. The off-shoulder cut brushes against your collarbones, the sleeves loose and billowy down to the wrist. The belt wraps snug at your waist, the buckle clicking into place with a finality that somehow feels symbolic. You tug on the fishnets, then step into the combat boots. You feel... taller. Not just physically. Like you take up a little more space in the world now, and for once, that isn't a bad thing.\n\n You turn slowly to face the mirror.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n And stop.\n\n You blink, once. Twice.\n\n The person staring back feels like someone you've met before in dreams. Maybe in moments of stillness. A you that's softer where it counts. Someone quiet, confident, not trying to shrink or guess what other people expect. The boots are bold, the lace is tender, and the look in your eyes is—\n\n Well. Something new.\n\n You tilt your head.\n\n Yeah. Maybe this isn't what you'd wear to school, or even out on a normal day. But in this moment? You look kind of incredible.\n\n From the other side of the curtain, the salesgirl's voice breaks through: \"Well? You still alive in there, or did the mirror swallow you?\"\n\n You let out a breath you didn't realize you were holding.\n\n \"It's...\" You hesitate, then smile, even though no one can see it. \"Kind of awesome, actually.\"\n\n You hear the faintest, smug little hum from beyond the curtain.\n\n \"Told you.\"\n\n [Choice: Step outside]\n\n \n You stop just short of taking the dress. It hangs there like a dare—dark, dramatic, and unapologetically bold. The lace flutters faintly in the low air-conditioning like it's breathing. There's a small, traitorous part of you that wants to know how it would feel, how it would look. How you'd look.\n\n But your hand doesn't move.\n\n Instead, you let out a quiet exhale and take a small step back.\n\n \"It's cool,\" you say. \"But... it's not really me.\"\n\n The sales associate's fingers freeze mid-swing on the hanger. She's good—recovers fast—but you catch the flicker of disappointment before it slips behind a polite nod.\n\n \"No worries,\" she says, tone smooth and even. \"Not everyone wants to look like a sad poem and a riot had a baby.\" She gently returns the hanger to its hook, letting the fabric settle like a sigh. \"Still. You had the vibe for it. Just sayin'.\"\n\n Samantha leans against the metal rack beside you, her arms folded, gaze lingering on the dress. \"Honestly?\" she mutters, eyeing the sleeves. \"If I were you, I'd be haunted if I saw someone else rocking it first. Like, I'd pretend not to notice, sure, but secretly spiral.\"\n\n \"Thanks, I guess,\" you muttter.\n\n \"Hey, I'm just saying,\" she smirks. \"It's dramatic. You're dramatic. Match made in mall goth heaven.\"\n\n You scoff but can feel the corner of your mouth twitch.\n\n The sales associate laughs softly, folding her arms. \"If nobody picks it up today, it's either going to sit in our system forever or get adopted by some kid who just found out what a goth was on TikTok.\"\n\n \"That sounds... dire,\" Samantha says.\n\n \"Right?\" the girl replies, lifting a brow. \"You'd be doing it a favor.\"\n\n You glance once more at the outfit, but the pull you felt earlier has dimmed. Like something inside you recoiled just enough to tip the balance.\n\n \"Thanks,\" you say, voice a little quieter now. \"But I think I'm good.\"\n\n She doesn't try to talk you out of it—just nods and steps back with practiced cool.\n\n As you and Samantha turn to leave, she nudges your arm with her elbow. \"Hey. You made the call. That's what matters. Still think you would've looked like a badass vampire girlfriend, but... whatever.\"\n\n You offer a small laugh, grateful.\n\n Behind you, the associate calls out, voice light and dry: \"Good luck finding something less moody!\"\n\n You and Samantha step back into the mall's glow. It's bright here—almost too bright after the cave-like intensity of ShatterBox. The floor tiles reflect everything, the food court smells vaguely like pretzels and spilled soda, and the entire atmosphere feels... gentler.\n\n Samantha stretches her arms overhead. \"Okay, so we survived. That was fun.\"\n\n \"It was definitely... an experience,\" you respond.\n\n \"Yeah.\" She pauses, then adds, \"You know you could've totally pulled that look off, right?\"\n\n You glance over at her. \"You think?\"\n\n She gives a quick shrug, as if it's the most obvious thing in the world. \"Please. You'd make that dress nervous.\"\n\n That gets a real smile out of you. One that sticks, warm and solid.\n\n \"Well,\" you say, gesturing vaguely toward the rest of the mall, \"should we keep going?\"\n\n Samantha bumpers her shoulder into yours. \"Yeah. C'mon. Let's find something that isn't haunted.\"\n\n And with that, the two of you walk off into the crowd—leaving behind the shadows, flickering lights, and a dress that still waits.\n\n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

The cold press of the little heart-shaped ring sits at your fingertips, and the fabric hangs heavier than you're used to. Not uncomfortable at all. Just.. deliberate. Like it's framing you, instead of hiding you.\n\n Your heart's beating fast, but it's not fear. Not really. It's closer to anticipation—like you just fell and are unsure whether you're about to fall or fly.\n\n And then you step out.\n\n Your boots land on the polished concrete with a soft but solid thud, each step echoing just slightly in the quiet stretch between the fitting rooms and the racks of oversized black sweaters. You look up—and there, at the end of the hall, a tall mirror framed in flickering LED vines waits.\n\n You see yourself.\n\n And everything halts.\n\n You don't look like you're pretending. Or dressing up as someone else. You don't look like a joke.\n\n Instead, you look like a version of yourself that makes sense. Like someone you've been slowly circling for a long time but never quite dared to approach.\n\n Samantha looks up from a table of studded wristbands, one eyebrow raised, a snarky remark clearly forming—but it never arrives. She pauses. Actually pauses.\n\n \"Oh,\" she says, blinking. \"Okay, damn.\"\n\n You raise your brows slightly. \"Is that good or bad?\"\n\n She crosses her arms slowly, tilting her head as she gives you a once-over. \"I mean, you kind of look like you bite people. But only those who deserve it, of course.\"\n\n You snort, tension easing.\n\n \"It's a compliment, by the way,\" she adds, quickly. \"I meant it in a good way.\"\n\n You glance down at yourself again, at the boots, the lace trim, the soft sleeves brushing your arms. Then back at your reflection. Your posture's a little straighter now. Your jaw set without thinking.\n\n \"I kind of... love it,\" you admit. You say it quietly, but you're not embarrassed.\n\n Samantha watches you for a second longer, then smiles. Not wide or mocking—just this subtle, satisfied little twist at the corners of her mouth. \"You should. You look like you were born in that dress. Like if you took it off, lightning would strike or something.\"\n\n \"You are so weird,\" you say—but it comes out smiling.\n\n \"Compliment received,\" she replies, giving you a quick salute.\n\n The salesgirl, who's been lingering just out of the way with her arms folded and an eyebrow lifted, finally steps closer. Her expression's unreadable for a moment, then softens into something knowing.\n\n \"Yeah,\" she says, like she already saw this outcome the second you walked in. \"It suits you.\"\n\n Samantha claps her hands once, dramatically. \"Alright. Final verdict? I think you're gonna have to fight me for that outfit.\"\n\n \"You wouldn't survive, you know,\" you deadpan.\n\n \"Oh, I know. But I'd die fabulous.\"\n\n You shake your head, laughing.\n\n You look back at the mirror. At yourself. And something just clicks.\n\n \"I think I've been waiting for this,\" you murmur.\n\n The salesgirl nods, like it's nothing new. \"And it waited for you, too.\"\n\n \n You ease the curtain open, one hand still gripping the fabric like it might be a shield. The boots thud quietly on the floor as you step out, the dress trailing just slightly behind you with each movement—too fluid, too noticeable. Your arms cross instinctively over your chest, shoulders hunched a little tighter than usual, like that might make the whole thing feel less... loud.\n\n Samantha glances up from the display shelf where she's been absently poking at a velvet collar shaped like bat wings. Her eyes do a slow blink, and then widen. Not dramatically, not with a gasp or squeal—just a subtle hitch of breath, followed by a slow once-over.\n\n \"Well, well,\" she says, voice pitched with that usual dry sarcasm. \"Didn't expect you to fully commit. You're serving... haunted poetry major who drinks too much red wine.\"\n\n You try to laugh, but it comes out more like a cough. \"Yeah, I think I'm one silk ruffle away from reciting tragic monologues in a thunderstorm.\"\n\n You stand awkwardly, shifting your weight from one boot to the other. The belt digs a little where it sits across your hips—noticeable in a way you're not used to. The neckline feels too open, the hem just slightly too short. You're aware of every inch of fabric. You don't hate how it looks exactly, but wearing it feels like stepping into someone else's outline. Not quite yours.\n\n The salesgirl approaches with a slanted smile, her arms still folded as she scans you up and down. \"I can't lie,\" she says, tilting her head, \"that's a strong silhouette.\"\n\n You manage a half-smile. \"I guess that's a vibe.\"\n\n \"Oh, it's definitely a vibe,\" she replies. \"I've seen way worse first tries. You're pulling it off more than you think.\"\n\n You nod, tugging subtly at the sleeve where it slides down your arm again. \"It's cool. Just... doesn't really feel like me.\"\n\n Samantha tilts her head and takes a step closer, squinting at the belt. \"I mean, sure. It's a lot. But I've seen you in gym class. This is at least traumatic than those navy blue mesh shorts.\"\n\n \"Wow. Thanks for the support,\" you mutter, but it softens into a smile. \n\n She rolls her eyes. \"Look, all I'm saying is that you don't look bad. You just look... new. Like you're trying something out. That's not illegal.\"\n\n The salesgirl laughs. \"Not yet, anyway.\"\n\n You huff a laugh, rubbing your hand down the side of the dress. It's soft. Too soft. \"I feel like I'm in disguise.\"\n\n Samantha raises an eyebrow. \"Is that really a bad thing?\"\n\n You glance back at the mirror. The person staring back looks... fine. Stylish, even. The dress fits. The boots are cool. The belt, the sleeves, the neckline—they all work, in some objective sense. But it's like looking at someone who knows exactly what they want. And you don't.\n\n Not right now.\n\n \"Maybe it isn't a bad thing,\" you say quietly. \"But I don't think it's me.\"\n\n Samantha shrugs. \"Then it's not. You tried it. No rule says you have to walk out of here as an emo fashion icon.\"\n\n The salesgirl gives a little two-finger salute. \"Door's open if you ever change your mind, though.\"\n\n You nod, grateful. You don't hate what you see in the mirror. But you're not sure if it's a door you're ready to walk through.\n\n Still... you gave it a shot. That counts for something.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

The outfit doesn't feel like a costume anymore. It's snug in the right places, drapes in the right places—like it knew what it was doing long before you ever touched it. You can't quite name what you're feeling, only that it's unfamiliar and a little louder than you expected.\n\nSamantha's leaning against the edge of a nearby display table, arms folded, phone long forgotten. Her head is tilted slightly, her eyes flicking between your reflection and the real you—almost as if she's trying to decide if they're the same person. She's quiet. Not in the awkward way, but in the rare, thinking-too-hard way.\n\nThe salesgirl makes her way over, her boots tapping a steady rhythm across the floor. She walks like someone who's used to being in charge, shoulders relaxed and gaze sharp. Arms crossed, she stops a few steps away and scans you head to toe, her smirk lazy but genuine.\n\n\"So,\" she says, tilting her head. \"You buying it or just blessing the store with a one-time appearance?\"\n\nYou blink. \"The whole outfit?\" You glance down at yourself. \"Dress, boots, belt, choker, fishnets? All of it?\"\n\n\"The full look,\" she confirms. \"It's cohesive, don't you think?\"\n\nYou open your mouth, then close it again. \"It looks expensive.\"\n\n\"It probably is expensive,\" Samantha mutters under her breath, still watching your reflection like it might say something first.\n\n\"How much?\" you ask.\n\n\"Fifty bucks,\" the girl says.\n\nYou stop.\n\n\"...Fifty for everything?\"\n\nShe nods once, bored and smug. \"Corporate glitch. Inventory system threw a tantrum, clearance tag stacked on each other, I bundled it as a display fit to save time. Should be like two hundred, minimum, The boots alone usually retail for eighty.\"\n\nShe taps the side of her head. \"Indie belt maker, hand-stitched fishnets, locally made choker by some girl with a soldering iron—basically boutique quality across the board.\"\n\n\"What kind of chaos coupon magic...?\" Samantha says, trailing off as she raises both eyebrows.\n\n\"Right?\" the salesgirl grins. \"Anyway, today's your lucky day. Or the universe's weird little joke. Either way, it's yours if you want it.\"\n\nShe makes a slow orbit around you. When she completes the loop, she crosses her arms again. \"You pull it off.\"\n\nYou glance at Samantha.\n\nYour best friend meets your eyes, then shrugs, her voice softer than before. \"I mean... you kind of killed it. It really does work on you.\"\n\nYou glance back at the glass, half-expecting the reflection to crack or laugh or shake its head.\n\nBut it doesn't.\n\nIt just stands there like it's been waiting for you to catch up.\n\nThe salesgirl's tone dips, just a little. \"No pressure,\" she says. \"But if you feel even a little like you belong in that, I'd hold onto it. Most people aren't a good match for it.\"\n\nYour fingers graze the edge of the dress again. The hem sways gently with the motion, brushing against your legs. You can feel your pulse beneath your skin.\n\n\"So?\" the salesgirl prompts again, voice light but pointed.\n\nSamantha leans in a little, eyebrow raised.\n\nYour reflection doesn't blink.\n\nNeither do you.\n\n<<if [money] > 49>> \n [Choice: Buy it]\n \n[Choice: Don't buy it]",

The dress clings just enough, the boots make you feel grounded, and the belt, absurdly, feels like armor. There's a version of you staring back that looks self-assured and cinematic—like they walked straight out of a dream.\n\n \"I want it,\" you say, voice firm and quieter than expected.\n\n The goth salesgirl grins instantly, like she's been sitting on that smile the whole time. \"I fucking knew it. You've got the cheekbones and spirit for the outfit.\"\n\n Samantha makes a sound that's somewhere between a scoff and a laugh. \"Okay, wow. You're actually going for it.\"\n\n You step forward—still wearing the full outfit—and she doesn't ask you to take it off.\n\n \"Okay, look, technically I'm supposed to make people change before ringing them up,\" she says, unlocking the register. She glances up at you. \"But honestly? For this? We're gonna pretend that rule never existed. The vibes are too strong.\"\n\n She types something into the register, taps the screen, and then nods at the total. \"Fifty even. And let me be very clear: that's criminally cheap. Like, you should be arrested for getting away with it.\"\n\n You tap your phone against the reader without hesitation. The soft beep confirms the sale.\n\n Samantha mutters, \"Milestone reached,\" and leans one elbow on the counter. \"Retail therapy.\"\n\n You try not to smile, but it's useless.\n\n Behind you, you hear the salesgirl folding up the outfit's tag like it's a spent spell scroll. She slides the receipt across the counter, then lifts her chin.\n\n \"Honestly?\" she says. \"Wear it out. Let the world deal with it.\"\n\n You pause for half a second, then nod.\n\n Outside the store, the light feels brighter, but you don't flinch from it. The boots thud softly as you walk, the choker catching the overhead lights in glints. Samantha falls in beside you, one eyebrow raised in appraisal.\n\n \"You really did it,\" she says. \"You actually wore the dress.\"\n\n You glance over at her, feeling the weight of it settle on your shoulders.\n\n \"I did.\"\n\n \"And?\" she asks.\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n You don't rush your answer. \"It feels... right.\"\n\n Samantha smirks. \"Knew it.\" She punches your arm lightly. \"You're still a dork, though. Just a slightly more dangerous-looking one.\"\n\n You don't mind. Not even a little.\n \n \n You hesitate before answering. \"...It's interesting,\" you say finally. \"I don't even know why I bought it, it's not really me.\"\n\n Samantha watches you for a beat, then nods like she gets it. \"Fair enough.\" She gives you a quick smile. \"Still a dork either way. Just one in a cooler outfit now.\"\n\n You let out a soft laugh. It doesn't feel perfect—but it doesn't feel like a mistake either.\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n You stand there for a moment longer, still facing the mirror.\n\n The outfit fits. It really does. Something about it clicks. But even so... it doesn't feel like something you can take home.\n\n You take a small breath, steadying yourself, and turn away from your reflection.\n \n \"I think I'm gonna pass,\" you say, your voice quiet but clear.\n\n The salesgirl arches a brow, surprised—but not offended. \"Sure. Little disappointing, but your call.\"\n\n \"It was nice,\" you say, your voice quiet. \"But I think I'm just... not there yet.\"\n\n She studies you for a second longer. Then nods. \"Fair enough.\"\n\n From a few feet away, Samantha leans against a display case, eyes fixed on you like she's watching a scene unfold in her favorite show.\n\n \"You sure?\" she says, tilting her head. \"Because you kinda walked out looking like you'd just been summoned from a vampire coven in Transylvania.\"\n\n <<if [study] > 84>> \n You snort. \"I'm not qualified to dress like I belong in Romania.\"\n \n \n You snort. \"I don't even know where Transylvania is.\"\n \n\n \"It's fine,\" she says, brushing imaginary dust from her jacket. \"You looked cool. Like, 'accidentally started a cult' cool. In a good way.\"\n\n You smile faintly, ducking back into the changing room.\n\n Taking the outfit off is harder than you expect. Not physically—it slides off just fine—but it feels like shedding something more than fabric. Like unfastening the version of you that only gets to exist inside mirrors.\n\n You fold everything with care before stepping out.\n\n The salesgirl takes it without a word. Her smirk is gone now—replaced by something almost thoughtful. \"If you change your mind,\" she says, \"I've got the whole ensemble for a little longer. Just ask for it.\"\n\n You offer a nod in return. \"Thanks.\"\n\n Back in the mall, the air feels a little too bright. You blink against the sterile lights. Samantha falls into step beside you, hands shoved deep in her pockets.\n\n \"You know,\" she says, \"I was fully expecting you to buy it and then instantly regret it once someone's grandma gave you a weird look.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath. \"Would've served me right.\"\n \n \"But I still think it worked,\" she adds, glancing over at you. \"It suited you, even if you didn't keep it.\"\n\n \"Yeah?\" you ask.\n\n She nods. \"Yeah.\"\n\n You smile, soft and small, as the mall swallows you both back into its steady hum.\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

      "text": "You and Samantha step into StepUp Footwear, and the store greets you with that distinct mix of new rubber soles, faux leather polish, and something vaguely citrusy that's probably meant to smell like \"clean energy.\" Bright lighting reflects off the freshly waxed floors, and the walls are lined with neat, curated displays—runners, skaters, flats, and slip-ons all perfectly aligned like they're waiting to be scouted.\n\nSamantha exhales through her nose. \"God, I can already feel the pressure to be sporty just by standing in here.\"\n\nYou smirk. \"You're not sporty?\"\n\n\"I'm 'walks aggressively while trash talking my enemies' sporty,\" she replies, scanning the displays. \"Not actual physical activity sporty.\"\n\nYou make a beeline toward the sneaker wall, where a bright display labeled Vektix Collection catches your eye.\n\nThe first pair you reach for are the Vektix BreezeAir Lows—crisp white with delicate blue butterflies stitched along the sides, the pattern subtle enough to not feel loud, but detailed enough to feel special. The design almost shimmers under the overhead light.\n\n\"Oof,\" Samantha mutters. \"Those are dangerously close to cute.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"Dangerously?\"\n\n\"Like... if I see you in those, I'll assume you own a pastel planner and know how to braid other people's hair. Which, to be clear, I fully support. I'm just saying, there's a whole vibe baked into those butterflies.\"\n\nYou glance down at the shoes, lips curving slightly. Yeah. They're a vibe.\n\nA few steps over, another pair screams for attention—Vektix SwiftCharge Trainers.These are practically vibrating with energy: jagged hot-pink soles, orange laces, and a glossy finish that almost feels like it should hum when you pick it up.\n\nSamantha squints at them like they just insulted her. \"Okay, what even is this. Did the color wheel explode?\"\n\n\"They're kind of cool.\"\n\n\"They're a threat,\" she says, shaking her head. \"I feel like they'd just drag you into spontaneous parkour.\"\n\n\"They do look fast.\"\n\n\"No one wearing those bothers to walk, [name]. They dart. They leap over benches and vault escalators.\"\n\nYou can't help but grin. \"So... not for you, then.\"\n\n\"I'm allergic to cardio,\" Samantha says, giving you a flat look.\n\nYou keep moving and land at a trio of SomaSoft Flats—white, black, and brown. No branding, no frills. Just clean lines and quiet, reliable design.\n\nSamantha tilts her head. \"Ah, yes. The shoe equivalent of a tax form. Efficient. Reasonable. Emotionally neutral.\"\n\n\"They go with everything, you know,\" you respond.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not judging,\" she says. \"Actually, I am, but with love. I know your style. You like pretending you're mysterious and understated. These are very 'Don't perceive me, but also I dress on purpose.'\"\n\nYou shrug. She's not wrong.\n\nThen, tucked near the bottom row of a slightly recessed shelf, your eyes catch on a more hidden pair—SeraForm Streetlace Lights. Low-top, all white, matte finish, minimal in the best way. They don't scream. They don't beg for attention. But they're sharp—precise, even.\n\nSamantha leans in as you crouch for a closer look.\n\n\"Ooh. See, those are dangerous in a different way,\" she murmurs. \"Clean lines, sleek shape, total sleeper pick. You wear those, you're not trying to impress anyone—you're just inherently cool.\"\n\nYou straighten up and glance back at her. \"So what I'm hearing is you'll judge me no matter what I pick.\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" she says with a grin. \"But I'll do it supportively. Like a friend who knows too much.\"\n\nA store associate passes and nods politely. Samantha gestures toward the bench nearby, already nudging you toward it. \"Go on, Cinderella. Let's see if they fit.\"\n\nTime to try something on.\n\n[Choice: Try on the shoes]",

Samantha stands nearby, arms crossed loosely, tapping the heel of one sneaker against the floor like she's barely holding back a thousand opinions.\n\n\"Well?\" she says. \"How does it feel? Do they give you the power of flight, or are we talking more 'casually walk with slightly better posture' levels of impact?\"\n\nYou roll your ankle a bit. \"Honestly? Kinda great. Light, comfy. I think I'm done trying stuff on.\"\n\nSamantha shrugs with mock solemnity. \"We gather here today to honor [name]'s ankles. May they forever be supported and blessed.\"\n\nBefore you can roll your eyes for what feels like the tenth time today, a sales associate approaches—crew-cut, crisp store polo, clipboard tucked under one arm, and an approachable smile already in place.\n\n\"Looks like you're weighing some options,\" he says warmly, glancing down at the neat line of shoes you've already set out.\n\nYou nod. \"Yeah, just figuring out what fits best. Could I get the prices?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" He flips the clipboard and starts down the row.\n\n\"First, the BreezeAir Lows with the butterfly design. That's a limited, designer collab—forty dollars. They're pretty in-demand right now.\"\n\nSamantha snorts and lifts one up, inspecting it like it's a rare gem. \"Delicate and dangerous. Like you in a good mood.\"\n\nYou ignore her and glance at the next pair as he moves on.\n\nThe associate moves on to the neon trainers. \"These SwiftCharge Trainers feature breathable mesh and NeonGrip soles—designed for active days. Thirty dollars.\"\n\nSamantha winces dramatically. \"That's thirty dollars toward causing traffic accidents with your shoes alone. I respect it, though. Bold.\"\n\nHe chuckles politely, used to mall weirdos by the look of him.\n\nThe associate then gestures toward the flats. \"The SomaSoft options—white, black, and brown—are everyday classics at fifteen dollars combined.\"\n\nYou glance at Samantha, waiting for the inevitable commentary.\n\nShe doesn't disappoint. \"Ah, the introverts of footwear. So humble. So beige.\"\n\nFinally, the associate gestures to the pair you just took off—SeraForm StreetLace Lights, the matte white low-tops.\n\n\"Those are twenty. Classic look, low-profile, versatile. One of our bestsellers, actually.\"\n\nHe flips his clipboard and offers a small nod. \"Take your time. I can box them up when you're ready.\"\n\nSamantha leans down beside you, her expression unusually unreadable.\n\n\"No pressure,\" she says. \"But I will silently judge your taste forever based on this choice.\"\n\nYou side-eye her. \"Thanks for the support.\"\n\nShe smirks. \"Always.\"\n\nYou look back down at the options—each of them saying something different.\n\nIt's time to choose.\n\n[Choice: Choose some shoes to get]",

But something in your chest is pulling tight in that subtle, invisible way it sometimes does. Like when you're standing in front of a shelf full of choices and none of them feel exactly right, even if they should. Not today. Not yet.\n\n You exhale and lean back on the bench. Samantha watches you with a flicker of something in her eyes—not disappointment, exactly, just awareness.\n\n You slip your own shoes back on and stand up.\n\n Samantha raises an eyebrow. \"No dice?\"\n\n You shake your head. \"They're nice, just... I don't think I'm ready to spend on something I'm not completely sure about.\"\n\n She tilts her head slightly. \"Hey, no shame in walking away from a bad purchase. Or even a meh one. You'll know when it's the right pair.\"\n\n As you turn toward the front of the store, the associate from earlier spots you and steps forward. His clipboard is still in hand and his smile is still polite, if just a little dimmer.\n\n \"Find something you liked?\"\n\n You offer a small, apologetic smile. \"They were all great. I'm just gonna hold off for now.\"\n\n He nods, clearly trained for this exact moment. \"No worries. Happens all the time. Let us know if you changed your mind.\"\n\n He says it cheerfully enough, but there's that tiny flicker of disappointment, the barely-there sag in his posture as he steps aside. You give him a small nod of thanks as you pass, Samantha right beside you.\n\n Once you're through the sliding glass door and back into the open pulse of the mall. Your shoulders ease a little.\n\n \"Well,\" Samantha begins, \"we didn't find your perfect shoe soulmate, but hey—there's plenty of stores in the mall to conquer.\"\n\n You didn't leave with a new pair of shoes today—but that's okay. You went. You looked. Maybe next time you'll try again. And somehow, that feels like enough.\n\n \n \n You make your decision with a small breath through your nose, hand drifting to the pair that just feels right. You pick it up, letting your fingers glide along the edge one last time before you stand up.\n\n Samantha watches, arms still crossed, one brow raised like she's trying not to grin. \"So that's the winner, huh?\"\n\n You nod. \"Feels like it.\"\n\n \"Bold move,\" she says, inspecting the pair you picked. \"Courageous. Shoe critics will be divided for years.\"\n\n You ignore her and head toward the front counter, carrying the box. The associate spots you approaching and perks up.\n\n \"Found the one?\" he asks as he slides behind the register.\n\n \"Yep.\"\n\n He nods, taking the box from your hands and flipping it open for a quick inspection. \"Good choice.\" He scans the tag, the price popping up on the small digital display with a confirming beep.\n\n You pull out your phone and double-click the side button. The tap of your device against the reader is met by a soft chime, followed be a cheerful \"Payment Approved\" on the screen.\n\n \"Nice,\" he says, tucking tissue paper inside the box and closing the lid with practiced care. \"You want the box in a bag or just like this?\"\n\n \"Bag, please.\"\n\n He slides the shoebox into a paper bag with the StepUp logo embossed across the front. It crinkles lightly as he passes it to you. \"Here you go. Hope you get some good wear out of them.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you say, adjusting the handles in your grip.\n\n Samantha joins you at the exit, glancing once at the bag, then at you. \"Ah, the sacred shoe ritual is complete. You've officially leveled up.\"\n\n You look down at the bag. It's not really about the shoes. It's about the small, steady decisions that make you feel more you.\n\n It's not a full reinvention, but it is a step. And isn't that exactly what shoes are for?\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

The lighting's even harsher than the mall—bright overhead fluorescents that buzz faintly and wash everything in a slightly-too-white glow. The air smells like a mix of synthetic cotton, body spray, and something sharp that might be deodorant—or regret.\n\nSamantha practically skips inside. \"Oh my God. I'm home,\" she sighs, throwing her arms out like she's entering a holy space. \"Threadz, my beloved. You smell like chaos and social anxiety.\"\n\nYou glance around, still catching up. \"It's like if the internet had a very enthusiastic child.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" she beams, spinning slightly on her heel. \"Threadz doesn't make clothes, [name]. It makes statements. Like, this place understands that sometimes you need to dress like a cartoon character having a crisis.\"\n\nAnd honestly, she fits in perfectly.\n\nHer usual outfit could've walked straight off one of the mannequins: layered striped sleeves under a graphic tee, baggy high-waisted jeans cinched with a yellow \"CAUTION: KEEP OUT\" keychain belt, chunky sneakers with mismatched laces, and a beanie pinned with a smiley face and an alien. She's not trying to match the store—she simply is the store. Like some walking ambassador for chaos with charm.\n\nYou watch her bounce over to a display table labeled \"Mild Anarchy.\" It's piled with distressed hoodies, enamel pins that say things like \"Emotionally Unavailable But Still Hot,\" and sticker packs featuring haunted toasters and blushing devils.\n\nShe holds up a mesh long-sleeve top and wiggles her eyebrows. \"This, but over a tank top, under a denim vest, with plaid pants and combat boots?\"\n\nYou blink. \"That's oddly specific.\"\n\n\"That's oddly correct,\" she fires back, tossing it onto the growing pile in her arms.\n\nA guy about your age with dyed blue hair and chipped black nail polish glances up from where he's crouched, refolding a haphazard stack of oversized tees. His name tag reads \"Ash (he/him) - Certified Chaos Consultant.\" Without missing a beat, he throws up a lazy peace sign.\n\n\"Let me know if you start spiraling about which graphic tee defines your soul,\" he says, voice flat but weirdly warm. It's the kind of sentence that sounds like a joke, but also kind of like a real service they offer here.\n\nBefore you can respond, Samantha lights up. \"Ash! Oh my God, you're working today?\"\n\nAsh's expression softens into something like a smirk. \"Sam, hey. You back to haunt the hoodie wall?\"\n\nShe grins. \"Obviously. Like you even have to ask.\"\n\nThey fist-bump.\n\nYou blink. \"Wait... you two know each other?\"\n\nSamantha glances over at you like you just asked if water is wet. \"Yeah, duh. I basically live here.\"\n\nAsh nods, lazily tossing a refolded shirt onto the shelf. \"She's a Threadz regular. Keeper of the fitting room. Defier of bland fashion.\"\n\nSamantha does a little mock bow.\n\nYou stare at them for a second, then mutter, \"How do you have a whole lore with the retail staff?\"\n\nAsh just shrugs, pulling a bin of belt chains off the floor like this is all completely normal. \"Some of us have lives, man.\"\n\nYou drift forward toward a rack labeled, \"Not Quite Coping,\" your fingers brushing over a hoodie that says \"Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Want to Come to Terms with Myself.\"\n\nThere's something strangely honest about everything here. Like the clothes aren't even pretending to be normal.\n\nSamantha pops up beside you with another tee, this one reading \"I Know the Vibes Are Off, I Made Them That Way.\" She raises her eyebrows. \"Bro, this is basically your autobiography.\"\n\nYou snort. \"You're one to talk. Your beanie has more mood swings than I do.\"\n\nShe salutes, then tilts her head toward the fitting rooms. \"You gonna try anything? Or just stare at the fashion trauma pile all day?\"\n\nThe music shifts to something glitchy and weirdly soulful.

There's something about it—bold colors, chaotic prints, designs that thread the line between cute and deranged. It shouldn't work. But somehow, it kind of does.\n\n Your fingers skim over a bright pink anime tee with a smug-looking girl kicking over the word \"GAME OVER YOU LOSE.\" Her expression is a challenge. It's the kind of shirt that screams and dares you to scream with it. You glance at it, then at the mirror across the aisle, trying to picture it on you. It's a lot. And it's definitely kind of stupid. But also kind of great?\n\n Right next to it is another contender—a beige tee with a ridiculous ice cream cone full of cartoon guinea pigs. They all have cute eyes and blobby expressions like they have no idea how they got here. You let out a quiet snort through your nose. Samantha immediately peeks over your shoulder.\n\n \"Is that the one with the rodent sundae?\" she asks, practically vibrating with interest. \"Oh my God, its so dumb. I love it. Get that one.\"\n\n You ignore her for now and pick up the third: a tan hoodie with a slightly faded butterfly across the chest. The drawstrings are uneven, and the sleeves are a dark brown. It already feels like something that would live on your desk chair.\n\n You shift all three over your arm.\n\n Samantha lets out a gasp like she's watching a plot twist unfold. \"Wait. Wait. Are you actually gonna try stuff on?\"\n\n You look at her, mildly bewildered. \"I mean... yeah? Maybe? Just to see.\"\n \n Samantha clutches her heart dramatically. \"It's happening. This is a spiritual awakening. A fashion reawakening. You're finding your inner Threadz goblin.\"\n\n \"You're making it weird,\" you mutter.\n\n \"Correct,\" she beams. \"Let me have this.\"\n\n From somewhere behind the counter, Ash pokes his head out. \"Fitting rooms are that way,\" he calls out, gesturing toward a hallway with glittery tape around the frame. \"Second one's got decent lighting. Avoid the first one unless you like being jump-scared by your own reflection.\"\n\n \"Thanks, Ash,\" Samantha chirps.\n\n You glance between them, then raise an eyebrow. \"So, you guys are... friends?\"\n\n Samantha grins, all teeth. \"Ash basically works every weekday. I come in so much they added me to their employee group chat. I think I'm still in there.\"\n\n \"She's Threadz royalty,\" Ash says, nodding. \"Honorary shift lead.\"\n\n \"Anyway, let's focus,\" Samantha says, steering you gently toward the changing rooms. \"Anime girls committing war crimes. Rodents. Butterflies. Pick your path.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but don't resist as you reach the hallway.\n\n Samantha gives you a double thumbs-up. \"I believe in you. Try all three. Let the fabric speak to you.\"\n\n You snort but slip inside. The fitting room's small but surprisingly clean. The mirror is a little smudged, sure, but catches you fully. You hang the three tops on the hook, then pause, heart thudding in your chest.\n\n Okay. Here goes nothing.\n\n [Choice: Try on clothes]\n\n \n You hover near the end of the aisle, the tag of a graphic tee still brushing your fingertips. The store buzzes around you—music thrumming in your chest, the faint chemical tang of synthetic, and Ash laughing softly at something Samantha said from across the room. The lights are loud. The energy's louder.\n\n You take a breath and step back.\n\n Samantha turns the moment you move. She's holding up a mesh crop top layered over a pastel tank with a pixel heart on the front. \"What about this one?\" she calls, hopeful. \"It's a little weird, sure, but in a good way.\"\n\n You shake your head. \"I think I'm good.\"\n\n She frowns, clearly disappointed.\n\n \"Come on,\" she says, jogging the few steps over, her sneakers squeaking faintly on the floor. \"We literally just got here. You haven't even looked through the racks over in the back! That's where all the weird one-offs live. There might be something super cursed. You love cursed.\"\n\n \"I'm just not really feeling it,\" you say, offering a weak smile.\n\n Samantha lets out a long, theatrical sigh—head tilted back, eyes closed like she's mourning a fallen comrade. Then she peeks one eye open at Ash across the store and calls out, \"Hey, Ash! My friend's being a fashion coward!\"\n\n Ash, still refolding shirts like his life depends on it, doesn't even bother to look up. \"Cowardice is a valid aesthetic,\" he calls back.\n\n \"See?\" you say, already walking toward the door. \"Even your people agree.\"\n\n \"Dude, they're not my people, they're just—ugh, whatever.\" She trails behind you with all the enthusiasm of someone being dragged out of an amusement park before actually getting to do anything fun.\n\n You push open the door, the mall's softer lighting spilling across your sneakers. The sharp buzz of Threadz' fluorescent chaos fades behind you.\n\n Samantha doesn't follow right away.\n\n You turn, expecting her to be right at your side, but instead she's lingering in the doorway. She turns her head just slightly to look back at the store, one hand still gripping the handle like she's not quite ready to let go.\n\n \"Goodbye, sweet prince,\" she murmurs.\n\n \"...Are you seriously talking to the store?\"\n\n She doesn't answer. Just gives a solemn nod and finally steps back out into the mall like it physically pains her.\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"You okay?\"\n\n \"I'll survive,\" she says, dramatic as ever. \"But just so you know, I'm putting 'Refused To Try On Even One Graphic Tee' on your gravestone.\"\n\n You snort. \"Fair. Just make sure they carve it in Comic Sans.\"\n\n She glares. \"Now you're just being disrespectful.\"\n\n [Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

The tiny fitting room mirror is rimmed with chipped stickers—smiley faces, pixel hearts, and a ghost giving a thumbs up. It feels more like a closet than a changing room, but still weirdly comforting.\n\nYou try the anime girl tee first. The pink practically shouts under the overhead light, and the chaotic design is even louder on your chest. For a second, you grimace. But then you realize it... actually kind of works. It's confident in its own strange way, like it knows it's over the top but doesn't care.\n\nThe guinea pig shirt is next. It's the exact opposite: softer, gentler, warm in tone and even warmer in vibe. You smile without meaning to. It's so dumb. Like, painfully so. But you like it.\n\nThen the hoodie.\n\nIt slides on like it's already yours. Oversized, but not in a bad way. The butterfly rests right over your heart, and something about it makes you pause. You pull the hood up for a second and glance in the mirror. You look like someone you might be okay being.\n\nYou hear a knock at the wall.\n\n\"All good in there?\" the sales guy calls. \"Heads-up, by the way—we're doing ten-dollar graphics today. Hoodies, tees, all of it.\"\n\nYou blink. \"All of it?\"\n\n\"Yup,\" he says. \"Clearance push. Manager's order. It's basically a steal.\"\n\nYou glance back at the three items. Only ten bucks each. You could actually get more than one without your wallet screaming.\n\nYou turn back to the mirror, heart tugging between impulse and logic.\n\n[Choice: Buy something]",

She's seated dramatically on a bench near the accessory wall, spinning a choker around one finger like a villain awaiting news of a conquest. \"So?\" she asks, eyes bright. \"What's the verdict?\"\n\n You hesitate. Then sigh.\n\n \"Sam, I don't think I'm gonna get any of them.\"\n\n Her face falls in a way that's so exaggerated it circles right back around to funny. \"What?\"\n\n You shrug. \"They just didn't feel right. I don't know.\"\n\n \"But you looked good in them! The hoodie gave you mysterious loner energy. The guinea pig shirt was quirky. And the pink one? It was practically daring the world to fight you.\"\n\n \"I don't want the world to fight me,\" you say, placing down the tops gently. \"I want the world to leave me alone and maybe offer me a pretzel.\"\n\n \"You are such a plain bagel sometimes,\" Samantha mutters, her voice filled with the kind of despair usually reserved for anime that don't get more than one season.\n\n \"I just didn't feel like me in any of them,\" you say, attempting diplomacy. \"Or maybe I did, but it was like... the version of me that would immediately get shoved into a locker.\"\n\n \"Oh my God, that's the whole damn point, [name]!\" she cries. \"They were statement pieces. You're supposed to wear them like armor or a threat.\"\n\n \"A very loud, cartoonish threat,\" you offer.\n\n Samantha groans and plants her face in her hands. \"I hyped this up too much. I should've started you with the neutral stuff. Eased you in with a spooky moth tank top.\"\n\n \"I do like moths,\" you admit.\n\n She peeks up at you between her fingers. \"You'll be back soon. You will. I will get you to leave this mall in something that actually looks good. Not the shit that NovaTrend sells.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but smile. \"Is this how you talk to all your shopping buddies?\"\n\n \"Only the ones I love,\" she replies without missing a beat, hopping up. \"Alright. Let's get you out of here before Ash sees you returning everything and puts your face on the 'stylistically hopeless' wall.\"\n\n You glance over your shoulder. Ash does not appear to be watching. He is, in fact, trying to wrangle a mannequin into a crop top that clearly wasn't designed for plastic limbs. You silently wish him strength.\n\n You and Samantha head for the exit. As you pass the hoodie rack, she lets out a soft, wistful sigh and touches a sleeve like she's saying goodbye to a dear friend.\n\n You glance over. \"You good?\"\n\n \"I just... I had dreams for you,\" she says solemnly. \"You were gonna emerge from that store a transformed being. A butterfly in a graphic tee.\"\n\n \"Instead I remain a sad little caterpillar,\" you say, patting your own chest.\n\n She narrows eyes. \"A coward caterpillar.\"\n\n \"Caterpillars don't even wear clothes,\" you argue.\n\n \"They would, if they had the chance,\" she snaps back.\n\n You open the doors, and the fluorescent chaos of Threadz fades behind you as you step back into the mall proper. Samantha throws one last dramatic glance over her shoulder, whispering, \"Someday...\" like she's in a telenovela.\n\n You keep walking.\n\n \"Stop being weird.\"\n\n \"Never.\"\n\n \n You step out of the fitting room with the clothes folded neatly over one arm, your hair slightly mussed and a strange lightness in your chest that you can't quite explain. Samantha is waiting just outside, leaning dramatically against a rack of crop tops like she's about to faint from hunger or boredom.\n\n The moment she sees you, she perks up. \"Sooooo? Spill. Did the butterfly speak to you? Did the guinea pigs whisper their secrets? Did the anime girl tell you to embrace chaos?\"\n\n You shoot her a dry look. \"One of them might've tried to kill me.\"\n\n \"So you liked them,\" Samantha says, grinning.\n\n \"I didn't say that.\"\n\n \"You didn't have to. You're glowing.\"\n\n \"I'm not glowing.\"\n\n \"You so are.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but the corner of your mouth betrays you with a reluctant smirk. \"Okay, fine. I liked them more than I thought I would.\"\n\n <<if [acceptance] > 19>> \n Samantha clasps her hands over her heart. \"My disaster. My sweet, beautiful, fashionably confused disaster. I knew you had it in you.\"\n \n \n Samantha clasps her hands over her heart. \"My boy. My sweet, beautiful, fashionably confused boy. I knew you had it in you.\"\n \n\n \"You act like I climbed Everest,\" you mutter.\n\n \"You emotionally climbed Threadz,\" she says, dead serious. \"That's harder.\"\n\n Ash reappears just in time, arms full of socks and chaos. \"Hey, did we settle on a winner?\"\n\n You glance down at the pile in your arms. \"I think I'm good.\"\n\n Ash nods solemnly. \"A fine haul. Let's get you cashed out.\"\n\n The register beeps as he scans your selections—though he doesn't comment on what you chose, only gives you a small, knowing smile like he gets it.\n\n \"That'll be—\" he pauses to tap a few buttons, \"a very reasonable number for the identity crisis you just resolved.\"\n\n You pull out your phone and tap it against the reader. The little ding of confirmation feels more satisfying than it should.\n\n Behind you, Samantha lets out a soft, triumphant \"yes\" under her breath.\n\n Ash hands you the bag. \"May these garments bring you emotional stability and drip.\"\n\n You blink. \"Thanks?\"\n\n \"Go forth and slay, or whatever people say nowadays,\" he says, then immediately trips over a lanyard on the floor and yells, \"I meant to do that.\"\n\n Samantha snorts and grabs your arm. \"Alright, trendsetter. Let's go before Ash accidentally summons a demon from the clearance bin.\"\n\n You push open the door, the mall's softer lighting spilling across your sneakers. The sharp buzz of Threadz' fluorescent chaos fades behind you.\n\n You look at Samantha. She's smiling, smug in that way only she can pull off without being punchable.\n\n \"Proud of you,\" she says.\n\n You pause. \"Really?\"\n\n She shrugs. \"Yeah. Seriously. I know you didn't have to. But you did.\"\n\n You walk in silence for a moment. Then you say, \"Well, you were really annoying about it.\"\n\n \"Obviously,\" she says brightly. \"Annoying works.\"\n\n And maybe she's right—because you don't feel like the same [name] who walked into that store. Not entirely. Maybe just enough to matter.\n \n\n[Choice: Make your way back to the central area]",

The screen glows softly, and Jordan's name at the top of the screen feels different tonight—not distant, not uncertain. Just there.\n\n He was always guarded. The kind of guy who kept his walls high and didn't offer second chances easily—especially not after that first run-in at the mall, where he bumped into you and acted like you were the problem. It wasn't exactly the start of a friendship, to say the least. But somehow, through every awkward moment, every careful conversation, you chipped away at the distance.\n\n And now... here you are.\n\n You send:\n\n \n \n [name]\n hey\n \n \n\n And not even five seconds pass before your screen lights up again:\n\n \n \n Jordan\n hey u\n \n \n\n You feel that now-familiar warmth ripple through you.\n\n \n \n [name]\n i couldnt sleep tbh\n \n \n \n [name]\n figured u might be up too\n \n \n \n Jordan\n was literally just abt to text u lol\n \n \n \n Jordan\n guess were synced or smth\n \n \n\n You grin.\n\n \n \n [name]\n guess im psychic\n \n \n \n Jordan\n youd tell me if u were, right?\n \n \n \n Jordan\n like if u knew i was gonna fall down the stairs tmrw or some shit\n \n \n \n [name]\n ofc!\n \n \n \n [name]\n but only after it happens so i can laugh\n \n \n \n [name]\n lmao\n \n \n \n Jordan\n rude\n \n \n \n Jordan\n but fair\n \n \n\n You bite your lip, caught somewhere between smiling and rereading everything.

No emojis. Just an honesty that Jordan only gives when he really means it.\n\n \n \n Jordan\n you make it easy to talk, i guess\n \n \n\n You stare at the screen for a while and realize that yeah—this is what all those slow choices, awkward early texts, and half-finished hallway conversations led to.\n\n Something real. Something warm. Something worth having.\n\n And now, anything could happen next.\n\n [Choice: Be flirty]\n [Choice: Be friendly]\n [Choice: Be teasing]\n<<elseif [jordanRelo] > 29>> \n You sit cross-legged on your bed. The day's over, the lights have been dimmed, and your phone rests next to you, screen lit and waiting. You scroll aimlessly through apps, unread group chats, and half-typed notes to yourself before landing on something you weren't really looking for.\n\n Jordan.\n\n You haven't spoken to him today. Didn't cross paths at lunch, didn't run into him between classes. He's been lingering at the edge of your mind lately—quiet, steady, the kind of presence that makes you wonder if he's thinking about things as much as you are, even if he never says it.\n\n Your thumb hovers.\n\n Then, before you can talk yourself out of it, you type:\n\n \n \n [name]\n hey\n \n \n \n [name]\n just figured id check in\n \n \n \n [name]\n i hope thats not weird\n \n \n\n You wait. The reply takes a little longer than you'd like, but not long enough to make it uncomfortable.\n \n \n \n Jordan\n nah not weird\n \n \n \n Jordan\n hey\n \n \n\n Short and chill. The way Jordan always is.\n\n You lean back against your headboard, thumbs moving without too much thought.\n\n \n \n [name]\n i couldnt sleep tbh\n \n \n \n [name]\n kinda just laying here doing nothing lol\n \n \n \n Jordan\n same\n \n \n \n Jordan\n been meaning to crash for like an hour but my brains being annoying\n \n \n\n You smile a little, pleasantly surprised that he's engaging.

Guarded.\n\n Still, your thumb moves.\n\n \n \n [name]\n hey\n \n \n \n [name]\n couldnt sleep lol\n \n \n\n The message hangs there for a bit. You almost regret it before the typing bubble finally shows.\n\n \n \n Jordan\n why are you messaging me\n \n \n\n You blink. Not surprised, but yeah—it stings a little. You type back:\n\n \n \n [name]\n idk\n \n \n \n [name]\n just felt like saying hi\n \n \n \n [name]\n hru?\n \n \n\n It takes longer this time. When his reply comes, it's clipped:\n\n \n \n Jordan\n im fine\n \n \n \n Jordan\n dont rly do small talk tho\n \n \n\n You stare at the screen, debating whether to push it or just back off. Against your better judgement, you type:\n\n \n \n [name]\n sorry\n \n \n \n [name]\n just thought maybe youd want to talk\n \n \n\n Seen.\n\n Nothing.\n\n Then, finally:\n\n \n \n Jordan\n im not trying to be rude, just not in the mood for this\n \n \n\n That's it.\n\n You lock your phone and set it down beside you, the faint blue glow fading into darkness. Your chest feels a little hollow—not broken, not dramatic, just... empty space where something almost was.\n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n You stare at Jordan's name on your screen, thumb hovering above it. There's no logical reason to text him. You barely even know the guy. Every time you've interacted, he's been quiet, reserved, always a little hard to read—like he's halfway out the door, even when he's standing right in front of you.\n\n But still. Something pushes you to tap his name.\n\n \n \n [name]\n hey\n \n \n \n [name]\n sorry if this is random lol\n \n \n\n It takes a minute before the typing dots appear. Then vanish. Then reappear again. Finally:\n\n \n \n Jordan\n why are you messaging me\n \n \n\n You type back quickly, trying to recover some footing:\n\n \n \n [name]\n oh sorry\n \n \n [name]\n i just couldnt sleep\n \n \n [name]\n felt like saying hi\n \n \n\n There's a long pause. Like really long. You consider putting your phone down, but then a reply pops in:\n\n \n \n Jordan\n we dont really talk\n \n \n\n No emoji. No punctuation. Just that.\n\n You hesitate. Thumb hovering over the screen again. You type:\n\n \n \n [name]\n yeah i know. i just thought maybe...\n \n \n [name]\n idk\n \n \n [name]\n forget it\n \n \n\n Seen.\n\n No reply.\n\n You close the chat, turn your phone face down on the bed, and lie back into the silence. There's no sting, exactly. You expected this. Jordan doesn't let people in, especially not over a late-night text from someone he barely knows.\n\n Still, you tried.\n\n You turn off your light and the room folds into quiet.\n\n [Choice: Continue]",

Jordan, the guy who barely talks to anyone, who gave you the cold shoulder the first time you met, who probably didn't even remember your name back then. And now? He's texting you at night saying things like this.\n\n You could just keep things casual. Keep it friendly, safe, unremarkable.\n\n But you don't want to.\n\n So you let the warmth guide your thumbs.\n\n \n \n [name]\n careful\n \n \n \n [name]\n keep saying stuff like that and i might think you like talking to me or something\n \n \n\n The second you send it, you feel that mix of nerves and hope buzzing under your skin—because it's not too much, not a big leap. But it's something. And it's enough.\n\n He takes a little longer this time. You start wondering if you misread it, if maybe he's already closed the app. But then the bubbles appear. Typing. Pausing. Then typing again.\n\n \n \n Jordan\n maybe i do\n \n \n\n Three words. Simple. Blunt. But they land with more weight than you expect.\n\n You blink at the screen, then type quickly:\n\n \n \n [name]\n oh?\n \n \n\n And somehow that one-word reply says everything you want to ask.\n\n His response comes a few seconds later:\n\n \n \n Jordan\n i mean\n \n \n \n Jordan\n i dont rly text ppl\n \n \n \n Jordan\n not unless i wanna talk to them\n \n \n \n Jordan\n and i dont rly wanna talk to most ppl\n \n \n\n You smile, warmth creeping into your face as you pull your blanket closer around your shoulders.\n\n \n \n [name]\n well im honored lol\n \n \n \n Jordan\n u should be\n \n \n \n Jordan\n this is a pretty exclusive service\n \n \n\n You let out a soft laugh through your nose.\n\n \n \n [name]\n does it come with customer support?\n \n \n \n Jordan\n only if ur very polite\n \n \n\n You shake your head, grinning like an idiot now, the kind of grin that only happens when something clicks. Not like a sudden spark, but like something quietly falling into place.\n\n You stretch out under your blanket, the glow of the screen lighting your smile. And when the typing bubble flickers again, your heart already knows it's not over. Jordan isn't pushing you away. Not tonight. Not anymore.\n \n \n \n You reread Jordan's last message, and there's a quiet honesty to it that catches you off guard. It's not dramatic, not some huge declaration, but coming from him, it means something.\n\n You settle deeper into your blanket, thumbs moving without much hesitation this time.\n\n \n \n [name]\n that means a lot actually\n \n \n \n [name]\n ur easy to talk to too\n \n \n \n [name]\n ...when u want to be\n \n \n\n There's a pause, and then the typing bubble pops up again almost immediately.\n\n \n \n Jordan\n lol yh\n \n \n \n Jordan\n i know im not exactly a social butterfly\n \n \n \n [name]\n nah, but when u talk, its worth listening to\n \n \n\n You're not laying it on thick or anything—just being honest. And Jordan doesn't deflect like he used to.\n\n \n \n Jordan\n i appreciate that\n \n \n \n Jordan\n seriously\n \n \n \n [name]\n i dont hear that kind of thing often\n \n \n\n That makes you pause. Not because it's surprising, but because it hits deeper than you expect. You stare at the message, then type:\n\n \n \n Jordan\n ur a good person, [name]\n \n \n \n Jordan\n like actually good\n \n \n \n Jordan\n not fake nice\n \n \n\n You blink at that. Then, without thinking, type:\n\n \n \n [name]\n you too\n \n \n \n [name]\n even if u pretend ur all grumpy and mysterious\n \n \n \n Jordan\n lol ok fair\n \n \n \n Jordan\n but dont tell anyone\n \n \n \n Jordan\n ive got a rep to protect\n \n \n\n You grin.\n\n \n \n [name]\n secrets safe with me\n \n \n \n Jordan\n good\n \n \n \n Jordan\n i trust u\n \n \n\n The words are simple, but they land like something solid. You pull your blanket higher, a quiet calm settling over you that wasn't there before the conversation started.\n\n You weren't flashy or romantic, but you were real. And that matters.\n \n \n You read Jordan's message and grin a little, the corners of your mouth tugging up before you even realize it.\n\n That kind of honest from Jordan used to be rare. Early on, he barely gave you more than a nod. Now he's texting you at night, being real, even kind of soft. You could meet him in that same softness—keep it friendly, warm, maybe even a little sweet.\n\n But the moment feels just right for something else.\n\n So instead, you lean into the grin and type:\n\n \n \n [name]\n wow\n \n \n \n [name]\n soft jordan hours??\n \n \n \n [name]\n never thought id lived to see the day\n \n \n\n He doesn't take long to reply:\n\n \n \n Jordan\n dont get used to it\n \n \n \n Jordan\n i have a reputation to maintain\n \n \n \n [name]\n as a grumpy athlete with one facial expression?\n \n \n \n [name]\n ur rly branching out...\n \n \n \n Jordan\n hey\n \n \n \n Jordan\n i have at least two facial expressions\n \n \n \n Jordan\n the other one is when the vending machine actually works for once\n \n \n You snort as you type back:\n\n \n \n [name]\n ive seen that once\n \n \n \n [name]\n its basically joy mixed with awe\n \n \n \n Jordan\n can u blame me tho?\n \n \n \n Jordan\n those peanut butter crackers keep me going\n \n \n\n The rhythm is easy now. Back-and-forth with no awkward gaps, no hesitation. You can almost hear him saying the words, see the smirk on his face as he types them. It's weird to think about how natural this feels now.\n\n \n \n [name]\n well, ig im honored to be included in ur sacred snack time texts\n \n \n \n Jordan\n hmm\n \n \n \n Jordan\n ur like... second tier sacred\n \n \n \n Jordan\n right below vending machine\n \n \n \n Jordan\n but its close\n \n \n \n [name]\n second tier??\n \n \n \n [name]\n disrespectful\n \n \n \n Jordan\n fine\n \n \n \n Jordan\n tied\n \n \n \n Jordan\n but only if the machines out of crackers\n \n \n\n Your chest feels lighter than it has all day. You're both smiling—you know for a fact that he is. You don't need to see it to feel it. Right now it feels like you're exactly where you're supposed to be.\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n You stare at his message for a second longer than you meant to, the corners of your mouth pulling into a small smile. The compliment he sent is the kind that could easily be brushed off. But coming from Jordan, it's practically a sonnet. And you know he didn't have to say it. That kind of casual praise doesn't come from him often or easily.\n\n So you let your fingers move, not overthinking it—but maybe thinking just enough.\n\n \n \n [name]\n thats nice of u to say\n \n \n \n [name]\n ur not bad urself, yknow\n \n \n\n You stare at the message for a second, debating whether it's too much.

Not in a bad way—just like he read it twice.\n\n Then:\n\n \n \n Jordan\n thanks\n \n \n \n Jordan\n ur kind of surprising, u know that?\n \n \n\n You tilt your head at the screen, surprised.\n\n \n \n [name]\n how so?\n \n \n \n Jordan\n idk\n \n \n \n Jordan\n just didnt expect u to text me tonight ig\n \n \n \n Jordan\n not complaining tho\n \n \n\n Your chest does a little twist at that—small, but noticeable.\n\n \n \n [name]\n guess i just felt like talking to you\n \n \n\n You wait.\n\n He doesn't joke. Doesn't push it away.\n\n \n \n Jordan\n well... im not gonna tell you not to\n \n \n\n You lean back into your pillow, a soft smile tugging at your mouth, warmth blooming in your chest. It's nothing serious. Nothing concrete. Just a door opened a crack—and Jordan didn't close it.\n\n Not yet. Not at all.\n \n \n \n You read Jordan's message again, thumb brushing the edge of your phone. It's simple, but it's not empty. Especially coming from him. You smile a little, then type back, keeping it light.\n\n \n \n [name]\n i appreciate that\n \n \n \n [name]\n ur pretty solid too tbh\n \n \n \n [name]\n i feel like u dont say much, but when u do, it hits\n \n \n\n A pause. Then:\n\n \n \n Jordan\n lol\n \n \n \n Jordan\n coach says that too\n \n \n \n Jordan\n \"quiet until it matters\" or whatever\n \n \n\n You let out a quiet laugh through your nose.\n\n \n \n [name]\n guess that means i should take it personally when u do talk to me\n \n \n \n [name]\n in a good way ofc\n \n \n\n The typing bubbles come up faster this time.\n\n \n \n Jordan\n its cool\n \n \n \n Jordan\n i dont talk much\n \n \n \n Jordan\n and def not to everyone either\n \n \n\n You glance at that message a little longer than the others. Jordan's not the type to drop those kinds of lines if he didn't mean them.\n\n You respond:\n \n \n \n [name]\n well im glad ur talking to me\n \n \n\n There's a small pause, then:\n\n \n \n Jordan\n me too\n \n \n\n It's quiet after that. Not in a bad way. Just... settled.\n\n You lean your head back against the headboard, the light from your phone soft on your face. Jordan's messages are still up on the screen, and something about the conversation feels like a step forward. There's nothing dramatic. No big shift. But there is a kind of warmth that builds slowly.\n\n Jordan's not a talker. But tonight, he talked to you.\n\n And that matters.\n \n \n \n You read Jordan's message again, and it is a nice thing to say. Genuine, even. But instead of leaning into the warmth, you let a smirk pull at your lips as your thumbs move across the screen.\n\n \n \n [name]\n wow\n \n \n \n [name]\n high praise from the silent wall in the back row\n \n \n \n [name]\n should i frame this or just engrave it on something dramatic?\n \n \n\n You send it before thinking too hard. It's teasing, yeah—but light.\n\n The typing bubble flickers for a few seconds, then stops. Then comes back. Finally, a reply:\n\n \n \n Jordan\n lol\n \n \n\n That's it.\n\n You blink, suddenly aware of how short that looks. You try to recover:\n\n \n \n [name]\n kidding btw\n \n \n \n [name]\n appreciate it tho\n \n \n\n Another pause. Longer this time.\n\n Then:\n\n \n \n Jordan\n yeah is all good\n \n \n \n Jordan\n gonna head out tho\n \n \n \n Jordan\n night\n \n \n\n Just like that.\n\n You stare at the screen, thumb hovering over the keyboard, debating whether to type something else—but you don't. You know a brush-off when you see one. He's not mad. He's not being rude. He's just... done.\n\n You toss your phone onto the mattress with a soft sigh and sink back into the pillow, the weight of the silence suddenly sharper than it was before.\n\n Lesson learned. Jordan's not big on jokes that put walls between people. Next time, maybe you'll meet him where he is. Or maybe you won't get a next time.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

A little sharp. Sometimes a little too sarcastic when he didn't deserve it. He's the kind of person who's easy to dismiss if you're not paying attention—quiet, bookish, and kind of awkward.\n\n You hover a second longer, then tap.\n\n \n \n [name]\n hey\n \n \n\n The read receipt ticks by.

Like... actually? I'm not just a bit, right? You're sure?\n \n \n\n You smile and settle deeper into your pillows, blanket bunched around your shoulders.\n\n \n \n [name]\n im fr\n \n \n \n [name]\n go for it\n \n \n\n There's a momentary pause, like he's trying to stop himself—then gives in completely.\n\n \n \n Vincent\n Okay, so I've been digging into this late 14th-century diplomatic correspondence during the War of the Eight Saints between the Republic of Florence and Pope Gregory XI, and it's wild how intense and idealistic they were. Like, look, there's this one letter where Coluccio Salutati, the Chancellor of Florence, writes to the city of Lucca and urges them to resist papal authority. He says something along the lines of \"Remember that you are Italians, born to rule others, not to serve them.\"\n \n \n \n Vincent\n And when the Pope responded, it wasn't some soft apology. Pope Gregory XI condemned Florence in official bulls and placed the entire city under interdict, cutting them off from the sacraments and declaring everyone who supported them as heretics. He basically said: \"You oppose the Church, you oppose God.\" It was full spiritual warfare mode.\n \n \n \n Vincent\n And Salutati? He just kept writing—quoting Roman philosophers and arguing that the Pope was acting like a tyrant.\n \n \n\n You're grinning now. Somehow, all the weight of the day just sort of softens. It's not that they disappear. But Vincent's words fill the silence in a way that doesn't press on you. Doesn't expect anything from you.\n\n It's just him. Rambling, passionate, a little awkward, and totally sincere.\n\n He keeps going. You let him.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Then blink again.\n\n\"Bestie Twinning Day?\"\n\nYou groan out loud and drop the phone onto your chest.\n\nOf course. This stupid school and its stupid ideas. First backpacks, then desk pets, now... twinning.\n\nStill, there's something charming about it. Dumb, sure, but in an endearing way. Honestly, you can already picture a few people going way too hard with it, and the chaos is good to see.\n\nYou pick your phone back up and open your messages. No one's texted about it. Yet. Maybe you should beat them to it.\n\n[Choice: Text Luke]\n[Choice: Text Samantha]\n[Choice: Text Jessica]\n[Choice: Text Vincent]\n[Choice: Text Aurora]\n[Choice: Text Jordan]\n[Choice: I don't really want to twin]",

I can bring you some.\"\n\n He freezes, mid-chew. \"Uhhh...\"\n\n His eyes then flick toward you, then to Samantha, then back again like you just offered him a loaded grenade.\n\n Samantha leans forward, eyes sparkling with mischief. \"I can apply it for you, if you want,\" she offers sweetly.\n\n Luke jerks back. \"Uhhhhh, I think I'll just stick to football, thanks.\"\n\n You raise your brows. \"Come on, just a little. Clear gloss. You won't even notice it's there. Make your lips look healthier.\"\n\n \"Healthier?\" Luke exclaims, horrified. \"What does that even mean? I don't want shiny lips! People will think I'm sick!\"\n\n \"Right, because that's definitely the most concerning part,\" Samantha deadpans.\n\n You smirk. \"I mean, it's not like we'd force it on you.\"\n\n \"That's exactly what someone who's planning to force lip gloss on me would say,\" Luke mutters, narrowing his eyes.\n\n Samantha's smile turns downright evil. \"Sleep with one eye open.\"\n\n \"Nope!\" Luke says, startled. \"Nope. I'm not falling for this. I'm locking my windows tonight.\"\n\n You laugh. \"What do you think we're gonna do, crawl in and ambush you with a makeover kit?\"\n\n Luke doesn't answer right away. He just stares at both of you, face full of suspicion. \"Honestly? I wouldn't put it past either of you. One minute I'm dreaming about nachos, the next i wake up with winged eyeliner and kissable lips.\"\n\n \"Well, I think that would be an improvement,\" Samantha says with a shrug.\n\n \"You'd be fabulous,\" you add helpfully.\n\n Luke buries his face in his hands. \"This is harassment. I'm being bullied by my two best friends.\"\n\n You grin and take a sip of water. \"Welcome to lunch.\"\n \n \n \"Hey, Samantha,\" you say with a smirk.\n\n Samantha doesn't even look up from her food. \"No.\"\n\n You blink. \"I didn't even say anything yet.\"\n\n \"I heard the tone. I'm preemptively rejecting whatever dumb thing is about to come out of your mouth.\"\n\n You ignore her. \"Samantha,\" you say, like you're pondering something serious, \"how do you think you'd look in a cheer uniform?\"\n\n She freezes mid-chew.\n\n Then she raises her head to look at you, eyes narrowed. \"No. No, no, no, that's your thing. You're the one rocking the uniform with all the girls. Leave me and my beat-up sneakers out of this.\"\n\n \"Just asking!\" you justify. \"For science.\"\n\n Luke squints at her, head tilted like he's trying to visualize it. \"Huh... Actually, I don't think you'd be bad.\"\n\n Samantha whirls on him. \"Stop imagining me in a cheer uniform.\"\n\n Luke physically recoils, his whole body jerking backward like he just got punched. \"Agh! I wasn't, I mean, not in a weird way! It's just, like, you know...\"\n\n He lets out a whimper. \"[name], help me. She's gonna eat me alive.\"\n\n \"You brought that one on yourself,\" you say, snorting.\n\n \"I was being nice!\" Luke insists. \"I said she'd be good at it!\"\n\n \"I would rather join a tax seminar,\" Samantha says, deadpan. \"Actually, no. A pyramid scheme. I'd sooner sell diet pills on Instagram before I ever do synchronized clapping in a mini skirt.\"\n\n \"I mean, you do have the spirit down,\" you say. \"That's, like, half of cheerleading.\"\n\n \"Spirit?\" Samantha asks, befuddled. \"Me?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"In the form of sarcasm.\"\n\n \"Careful,\" Samantha states. \"I know everything about you.\"\n\n Luke shifts an inch further from her.\n\n You, on the other hand, can't help laughing. \"Okay, okay, noted. No cheer uniform for Samantha.\"\n\n \"Damn right,\" she mutters. \"I'm the background character that heckles from the bleachers. That's where I belong.\"\n\n Luke finally exhales, cautiously leaning back toward the table. \"Man... you're intense.\"\n \n \"And you're soft,\" Samantha says.\n\n Luke immediately nods. \"That's fair.\"\n \n This might not be the most conventional trio in the school, but it works. Somehow, it really does.\n \n \n \n \n \n You glance at Samantha, then Luke, then take a breath.\n\n \"That cheerleader,\" you say, voice even, \"the new girl with the black hair?\"\n\n Luke blinks. \"Yeah?\"\n\n \"...What about her?\" Samantha asks.\n\n You clear your throat. \"That girl's actually me.\"\n\n There's a beat of silence. Luke's face goes blank, then scrunches like he misheard you. \"Yeah, bro, stop joking.\"\n\n \"I'm not joking.\"\n\n Luke laughs like he's waiting for a punchline. \"Wait, what do you mean, 'you'? Like, she looked like you? Or like—\"\n\n \"No,\" you cut in. \"I mean it literally. I was the one in the uniform.\"\n\n Luke opens his mouth, then closes it again. His eyebrows knit together in visible confusion.\n\n Samantha's eyes, on the other hand, narrows slightly. She tilts her head, like she's mentally layering everything together—the disappearing act and the mystery cheerleader's features.\n\n \"...Wait,\" she says slowly. \"Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. [name]'s telling the truth.\"\n\n Luke turns toward her. \"Samantha, c'mon—\"\n\n \"No, think about it!\" she says, leaning forward now. \"Black hair, brown eyes, same height, same build. [name] wasn't there on game day. You said the cheerleader looked kinda like him, remember?\"\n\n Luke squints, mouth opening just a little. \"...Oh my God.\"\n\n You shrug, suddenly feeling a lot more awkward than you thought you would. \"Yeah. Jessica needed someone to fill in, and I said yes.\"\n\n Luke stares at you, then slowly turns red. \"Okay, um, uhh, when I said she was cute, I didn't know it was you, okay? That's not, like, dude, I didn't mean it like that—\"\n\n Samantha starts cackling.\n\n You grin despite yourself. \"Relax, man. I'm not mad.\"\n\n Luke still looks horrified. \"I CALLED YOU A [temp1] OUT OF 10.\"\n\n \"I'll take it as a compliment,\" you say dryly.\n\n \"Oh my God,\" he mutters, hands over his face.\n\n Samantha wipes tears from her eyes. \"This is so good. This is the best possible outcome. I cannot believe I missed it.\"\n\n Luke peeks between his fingers. \"So you're a cheerleader now?\"\n\n You shrug again. \"I guess I am. It started as a favor, but I'm sticking around for at least a little longer.\"\n\n There's another pause.\n\n Then Luke drops his hands and beams. \"Well, damn, bro. That's sick. You're out here with pom-poms and stuff?\"\n\n You laugh. \"Yeah. Pom-poms and everything.\"\n\n \"You know what?\" Samantha says with a smirk. \"I respect it. Way more school spirit than either of us has.\"\n\n \"Dude,\" Luke says. \"You're like... secretly cool. Like Hannah Montana, but in reverse.\"\n\n \"...Thanks, I think?\"\n\n He just grins. \"Can I see the uniform next time?\"\n\n \"No,\" you state firmly.\n\n Luke pouts.\n \n \n \"That girl did pretty well, huh?\" you say, keeping your tone light, like you're just another spectator. \"I heard she had good energy and solid jumps.\"\n\n Samantha nods, propping her chin in one hand. \"Yeah, she wasn't bad. Honestly? Better than a lot of the freshmen I've seen. She didn't seem to mess up the formations either. Definitely impressive considering Jessica was complaining about being down a squad member for ages.\"\n\n Luke leans across the table like he's about to share a secret. \"And she was cute,\" he says with a grin. \"She's Asian, too. Definitely my type.\"\n\n Samantha groans. \"Congratulations, Luke. You've described every girl you've ever had a crush on.\"\n\n \"No, but like, she had black hair,\" he continues unfazed. \"Like yours,\" he adds, pointing at you. \"Sort of the same height, too...\"\n\n You freeze mid-chew. Slowly, you look up from your tray. \"Lots of people have black hair,\" you say carefully, trying to sound amused rather than panicked.\n\n Samantha frowns, narrowing her eyes in thought. \"You know... we don't actually have that many Asian girls at our school.\"\n\n \"Uh-huh,\" you say, feeling your throat tighten slightly.\n\n \"And she's not in any of my classes,\" Samantha adds, eyes narrowing a fraction more as she leans slightly forward. \"I haven't seen her around in the hallways either. Maybe she's new or something?\"\n\n You shift uncomfortably. \"Could be. I mean, maybe she transferred in? Or just doesn't take the same routes. The school is pretty big, after all.\"\n\n Samantha is quiet for a second, her gaze locked on your face like she's trying to line something up. You feel your stomach knot. She squints slightly.\n\n Then, right as you're preparing to deflect or fake a coughing fit, Luke cuts in.\n\n \"Ohhh, wait, I figured it out. What if she's actually a ghost?\" he says, completely serious. \"Like, haunting the field. That'd explain why nobody's seen her before. She only appears during football games.\"\n\n \"You think the cheer squad is fielding a ghost as backup?\" Samantha asks, turning to him slowly.\n\n Luke nods. \"She could've died doing a backflip. Now she's doomed to cheer forever.\"\n\n You immediately latch onto the nonsense. \"That would make a great horror book.\"\n\n \"Like Goosebumps?\" Luke asks.\n\n Samantha groans again, rubbing her temples. \"I swear, I lose IQ points every time I listen to you talk.\"\n\n \"But imagine the headline,\" you say, grinning now. \"It would be something like 'She's got spirit... and it's literally haunting.'\"\n\n \"You know what? I'll allow that one,\" Samantha says.\n\n The conversation veers off completely into ghost puns after that, and you find yourself relaxing again. You didn't blow your cover, but that was way too close. Samantha's sharp, and Luke... well, Luke's Luke.\n\n Still, you glance at them both now, smiling faintly as Luke starts loudly speculating whether ghosts can do splits. For now, the secret's safe.\n \n \n\n [Choice: Continue]\n\n \n \n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"I'll go.\"\n\n There's a split second of silence before Luke practically explodes with excitement.\n\n \"YESSS!\" he shouts, nearly knocking over his tray. \"Dude! That's what I'm talking about! It's gonna be so good, you won't regret it! There's gonna be food, music, dance battles. Okay, don't tell anyone, but I heard the school booked that one guy who does tricks on a unicycle. It's gonna be epic.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Unicycle tricks?\"\n\n \"I swear to God that it's amazing,\" Luke says, hand over heart. \"I saw it on TV last year. Changed my life.\"\n\n Samantha snorts before speaking up. \"I guess I'll come too. Though it'll be kind of a tragic post-game celebration, huh?\"\n\n Luke stops mid-drink. \"What?\"\n\n \"You know,\" she says casually, not even looking up. \"Since you're definitely gonna lose.\"\n\n \"Excuse me?!\" Luke exclaims. \"This is slander.\"\n\n \"I'm not slandering,\" Samantha replies smoothly. \"I'm just being realistic.\"\n\n \"[name], [name],\" Luke says, turning to you. \"Tell her. Tell her we're gonna win.\"\n\n You shrug, drawing out the silence just enough to watch Luke panic. \"I dunno...\"\n\n \"[name]!\" he whines, grabbing your arm like you've betrayed him. \"Don't do this to me, man. Not you too.\"\n\n You crack a small smile. \"Relax. I'm just messing with you.\"\n\n \"You two are gonna be the death of me,\" Luke murmurs.\n\n \"Hey, if you lose, it won't be our fault,\" Samantha points out. \"You might want to focus on catching the ball instead of catching feelings.\"\n\n \"I don't drop passes!\" Luke says.\n\n \"Not according to last week's game footage,\" you mutter.\n\n \"It was knocked away by a defender!\" Luke says, groaning. He acts mad, pressing both palms to his face, but can't resist peeking at you through his fingers. \"Still glad you're coming though.\"\n\n You smile. \"You know what? Me too.\"\n \n \n \"I don't really want to go,\" you say, shrugging lightly.\n\n Luke blinks. \"Wait, what? Why not?\"\n\n You offer a weak smile. \"I just... I dunno. I'm not really feeling it.\"\n\n There's a beat of silence where Luke's whole face seems to crumple. \"But dude... it's homecoming.\" His voice is soft and confused now. \"It's the party. After the game. Everyone's going.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I know that,\" you say. \"I just don't really... wanna deal with all that. The noise, the people, the weird slow dances. And honestly? I'll probably be wiped after the game anyway. I want to rest on the weekend.\"\n\n Luke opens his mouth, then closes it again. He just slumps back a little in his seat. \"Man. That sucks.\"\n\n You try to soften it. \"It's not you or anything. I'm just not in the mood for crowds lately. I might chill at home. Maybe make nachos.\"\n\n \"Without me?\" Luke asks, gasping. \"How could you?\"\n\n Samantha, who's been eating her chicken during the exchange, finally speaks up. \"I'll probably go,\" she says with a shrug. \"But to be honest, it's probably not gonna be worth it.\"\n\n Luke turns to her with visible betrayal. \"Samantha! Not you too.\"\n\n She raises a brow. \"What? It's gonna be hours of watching people at the snack tables.\"\n\n \"I like snack tables,\" Luke mumbles, frowning.\n\n \"Of course you do,\" you mutter, smiling just a little.\n\n \"Look, I will show up, and I might even pretend to be impressed,\" Samantha states. \"But if it's a flop, I'm leaving early and making [name] share those nachos with me. The back-to-school party was enough for me.\"\n\n You smirk. \"I don't recall inviting you.\"\n\n She smirks right back. \"That's never stopped me before.\"\n\n \"Fine,\" Luke says, slouching. \"But you know, when we win tonight and everyone's throwing the most epic post-game bash of the year... you two will regret not dancing in the glow of my victory.\"\n\n \"Pretty sure the only glow is gonna be from the vending machine lights,\" Samantha says.\n\n \"And the shame of another loss,\" you add.\n\n Luke groans. \"This is emotional abuse.\"\n \n\n [Choice: Continue]",

Someone must've left it on for you. You slip off your shoes, leaving them behind as you make your way upstairs.\n\n Your room is the same as you left it. The desk is cluttered with random papers, a jacket is draped over your desk, and your blanket is all kinds of messed up. You toss your backpack to the side and collapse half-sideways onto the bed. Eventually, you end up sprawled out diagonally across the mattress, legs dangling off the edge. You stare up at the ceiling for a second, just thinking.\n\n But then you hear footsteps. Light, deliberate ones padding across the hall.\n\n The door creaks open without a knock.\n\n You don't even have to look. \"Lily, seriously?\"\n\n She doesn't answer. She just walks in like she owns the place before stopping at the side of your bed, arms crossed.\n\n \"Scoot,\" she demands.\n\n You lift your head just enough to look at her. \"Why?\"\n\n \"Scoot,\" she repeats, more firmly this time.\n\n There's no room for negotiation in her tone. With a reluctant sigh, you roll to the side and make room. Lily climbs in without hesitation, dropping down next to you like she's done a hundred times before.\n\n You both lie there for a minute, staring at the ceiling in silence. It's a rare moment of peace for the both of you.\n\n \"So...\" she says slowly, rolling onto her side to face you. \"You ready for the big homecoming party tomorrow?\"\n\n You glance at her. \"Guess so.\"\n\n \"That doesn't sound very ready.\"\n\n You shrug. \"It's just a party.\"\n\n \"Excuse me? This is the party,\" she corrects. \"Capital P Party. Everyone's gonna be there. I wish I could be there.\"\n\n You snort. \"Meh, it's just a party to me.\"\n\n She squints at you. \"Wait. DO you even have something to wear?\"\n\n \"Uhh, I'll just wear the old suit.\"\n\n \"...The one you got for the wedding?\" Lily asks, incredulous.\n\n \"Yup.\"\n\n Lily laughs. \"[name], that was two years ago.\"\n\n \"So?\"\n\n \"So!\" She props herself up on one elbow. \"You've grown. And also, you can't wear the same thing forever.\"\n\n \"It still fits,\" you mutter, a little defensive.\n\n \"Barely,\" she shoots back.\n\n \"Whatever,\" you mumble.\n\n Lily flops down beside you, hair fanning across the pillow. \"You must've really liked that suit then,\" she says, voice a little lighter now. \"Wearing it again and again.\"\n\n [Choice: I did not like that suit]\n [Choice: It's pretty solid]\n\n \n The house is quiet when you step inside, save for the gentle hum of the fridge and the faint tick of the clock. The living room lamp is still on, casting soft light over the couch. Someone must've left it on for you. You slip off your shoes, your limbs heavy with exhaustion.\n\n You make your way upstairs without really thinking, climbing each step like you're on autopilot. Your room greets you with the comforting mess of the familiar. Clothes are scattered around the floor, a jacket is draped over your desk, and your blanket is all kinds of messed up. Your bed calls to you like it's the only soft thing left in the world.\n\n You collapse onto it, arms spread, letting the mattress take your full weight. The ceiling spins before your breathing catches up. You let your eyes close.\n\n But then you hear footsteps. Light, deliberate ones padding across the hall.\n\n The door creaks open without a knock.\n\n You don't even have to open your eyes. \"Lily, seriously?\"\n\n She doesn't answer, just walking straight in with a casual confidence. \"Scoot,\" she demands.\n\n You groan, throwing an arm over your face. \"Ughhh, what is it, Lily...\"\n\n \"Scoot,\" she repeats, more firmly this time.\n\n You sigh dramatically, but your limbs are jelly and your brain too tired to protest. You shift over without argument, dragging your blanket with you. The mattress dips as she climbs in beside you, settling in.\n\n You glance sideways at her. She's lying on her back too, arms behind her head, hair still a little wild. There's a slight smirk tugging at her lips, like she's already preparing something.\n\n \n \n \"So. How was cheerleading?\"\n\n You blink, caught off guard for half a second, before remembering that you have told her. About a week ago, right after that whirlwind of a first practice where everything had started feeling real.\n\n \"Honestly? It was really good,\" you say, smiling a little. \"We nailed our halftime routine, the energy was super high, and Pacific Crest crushed it. We won, easy.\"\n\n Lily whistles, clearly impressed. \"Yeah, I saw it on Insta. You guys blew out Sierra Heights. A lot of my friends reposted highlights on reels.\"\n\n \"Of course they did,\" you say, laughing.\n\n \"Guess the homecoming party's gonna be sweet, huh?\" she says, shrugging.\n\n You nod. \"Yeah. Tomorrow's gonna go crazy. Everyone's going to be hyped.\"\n\n The room settles again. You and Lily lie there, side by side, your arms occasionally bumping, like siblings do when neither wants to say they like the company but neither one moves away.\n\n She's the first to break the silence again.\n\n \"So what's the schedule like now? You've got more games coming up, right?\"\n\n You turn your head toward her. \"Yea. Two away games. Then we've got another home game in... three weeks, I think?\"\n\n Lily hums in thought, then turns to look at you, expression suddenly serious in that way she gets when she's about to say something that matters.\n\n \"Think I could come?\" she asks. \"Y'know. To watch you cheer. See the whole thing for myself.\"\n\n She says it like it's no big deal, but her voice has that hint of curiosity underneath.\n\n You hesitate, not because you don't want her there, but because... well. You'll have to decide.\n\n [Choice: Sure, you can come]\n [Choice: I don't know...]\n \n \n \"So,\" she says, tone deceptively casual. \"How was the homecoming game?\"\n\n You blink at the ceiling, trying to decide on the safest answer. \"We won.\"\n\n She scoffs. \"Yeah, no duh. I saw the post on the school Insta. Pacific Crest demolishes Sierra Heights, blah blah blah.\" She rolls onto her side, glaring at you now. \"I meant, how was it to watch the game?\"\n\n You swallow. The ceiling suddenly looks very interesting.\n\n \"I mean,\" you mutter. \"It was fine.\"\n\n \"You were gone a while.\"\n\n \"Yeah.\"\n\n \"The game ended at nine.\"\n\n \"...Yeah.\"\n\n She stares. \"It's midnight.\"\n\n You freeze. You didn't even realize it was that late. Your whole body still hums with adrenaline. You're not sure how to begin unraveling all of it, especially not with your little sister grilling you.\n\n \"Uhhh...\" you try.\n\n She raises an eyebrow. \"That's your answer? Uhhh?\"\n\n There's something dangerous in her tone now. Not angry, but knowing. This is the Lily who used to blackmail you for snack money in elementary school. The Lily who once found your hidden Halloween candy stash and made a spreadsheet about how it would be rationed between the two of you. The Lily who always seems to know when you're hiding something.\n\n She props herself up on one elbow. \"Wanna tell me what really happened?\"\n\n You glance over at her, seeing the little glint of mischief in her eyes. You could lie. You could dodge. You could try and brush it off.\n\n But Lily Yoon doesn't fall for that.\n\n And now you're left sitting there with one very determined sister waiting for the truth.\n\n [Choice: Tell her the truth]\n [Choice: Deflect]",

The moment they're out, you feel Lily shift next to you, turning her head to look at you more directly.\n\n \"Huh?\" she says, not judgmental, just surprised by the change in tone. \"Why not? I mean, it looked fine. I guess. Kinda tacky.\"\n\n You let out a soft breath, staring up at the ceiling.\n\n \"I don't know,\" you start, voice quiet. \"I just hated how I felt in it.\"\n\n Lily doesn't say anything, so you keep going, words coming slowly.\n\n \"I remember putting it on and looking in the mirror and just feeling... off. Like, not ugly or anything, just wrong. I tried fixing my tie, straightening the jacket, whatever. But it never helped. I didn't feel like me.\"\n\n Lily hums softly.\n\n \"Maybe it's dumb,\" you add quickly. \"It's just a suit.\"\n\n \"No it's not,\" she says, just as quick. \"It's not dumb.\"\n\n You glance over again. She's on her side now, looking at you seriously. Even her usual fire is tempered.\n\n \"I think it matters,\" she states. \"If something makes you feel weird, even if you don't know why, that matters.\"\n\n You nod a little, grateful even if you don't have the words to say so. She reaches over and flicks your forehead gently, just enough to make you blink.\n\n \"I've always got your back, bro,\" she says quietly. She then immediately swings her legs off the side of the bed and stands up. \"I gotta go do some skincare now. I can not let you be the cutest Yoon.\"\n\n You roll your eyes. \"You're not even close.\"\n\n She grins and walks to the door. \"Night, weirdo.\"\n\n Then she's gone. And for a while, all you can do is lie there in the quiet, staring up at the ceiling fan, wondering what \"feeling like you\" is supposed to look like.\n \n \n \n \n \"It's pretty solid,\" you say with a small nod, thinking back to the black suit hanging in your closet. It's nothing fancy, but it had made you feel polished the first time you wore it. You still remember your mom fussing over the sleeves while your dad gave an approving nod.\n\n Lily stares at you, unimpressed. \"Solid?\" she repeats, scrunching her nose. \"I thought you looked a little tacky in it, honestly.\"\n\n You scoff. \"C'mon now.\"\n\n \"I'm serious,\" she says, grinning now. \"You looked like a kid whose mom dressed them up for a spelling bee.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but there's a smile tugging at your lips. \"You mean dashing and well-composed.\"\n\n \"I mean what I said,\" she fires back. \"Tack and boxy.\"\n\n You laugh. \"You're ruthless.\"\n\n Lily shrugs. \"I have standards.\"\n\n \"You're literally in my room uninvited.\"\n\n \"And yet you scooted,\" she says with smirk.\n\n \"That's because I feared for my life.\"\n\n \"As you should.\"\n\n The banter fizzles into a comfortable quiet. The two of you just enjoy each other's presence for a few minutes before Lily swings her legs off the side of the bed and stands up without warning.\n\n \"Anyway, don't embarrass me tomorrow,\" she says. \"I don't want my big brother to be the one who spilled soda all over himself.\"\n\n \"No promises,\" you mutter, grinning.\n\n She opens the door halfway, then pauses and looks back. \"Sleep well, dashing one.\"\n\n You make a face. \"Get out.\"\n\n She leaves with a laugh, the door clicking shut behind you.\n \n\n \n \n \n \n Lily watches you for a beat, then grins when you give a little shrug and say, \"Yeah. Sure. You can come.\"\n\n Her eyes light up. \"Hell yeah,\" she says, already sitting up like she's just won something. \"See you in three weeks then, superstar.\"\n\n You can't help the laugh that bubbles up. \"You better not make fun of me.\"\n\n Lily's expression turns mock-serious. \"I would never.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow.\n\n \"...Okay, maybe a little,\" she admits, already walking toward the door. \"Like, just a respectful amount. Like a sibling's legal limit.\"\n\n \"No heckling allowed from the stands,\" you say, throwing a pillow in her direction.\n\n She catches it with one hand, tosses it back lazily, and gives you a sly smirk. \"What if I bring one of those giant heads with your face on it? Like really big. Super cursed.\"\n\n \"Please don't.\"\n\n \"I'm already placing the order.\"\n\n You groan and roll over to bury your face in your blanket, grumbling something about regretting everything. She just laughs, steps out into the hall, and grabs the door handle behind her.\n\n \"Night, cheer queen,\" she calls, just as the door starts to close.\n\n \"Night, chaos goblin.\"\n\n The door clicks shut, leaving the room comfortably quiet again. The muffled sounds of the house settle around you, familiar and warm. You're still smiling as you sink deeper into the mattress, the softness of the day finally catching up to you.\n \n \n Lily's question hangs in the air for a beat too long, and when you answer, you try to keep your voice light.\n\n \"I... don't think that's a good idea.\"\n\n You glance at her from the corner of your eye, catching the flicker of disappointment in her expression. She looks up at the ceiling like she's trying to pretend it doesn't bother her.\n\n \"Oh,\" she says, and for once, her voice doesn't carry that usual fire.\n\n She sits up. \"Well, whatever,\" she adds with a toss of her head. \"I'll just find a video on Insta or whatever. I'm sure someone posted the halftime show.\"\n\n \"You better not,\" you warn, groaning.\n\n She smirks, but the usual spark behind it feels dimmer than usual. \"We'll see.\"\n\n She stands, brushing the blue strand of hair away dramatically. She opens the door, steps out, and closes it behind her.\n\n The room goes quiet again, leaving you staring up at nothing.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n You inhale, slow and quiet, before finally saying it.\n\n \"I joined the cheer team.\"\n\n Lily doesn't respond at first, her mouth hanging open. Then:\n\n \"No. Shot. Cheerleading?\"\n\n You nod, lips pressed together.\n\n Lily stares at you. \"Are you serious right now?\"\n\n \"Yeah.\"\n\n She pushes herself up so she's sitting cross-legged, now properly staring at you. \"You? You couldn't even touch your toes in middle school! You, of all people, joined the cheer squad?\"\n\n \"I mean, I'm way more flexible now,\" you mutter.\n\n \"Okay, but why?\" Lily asks, visibly processing this information.\n\n You shrug. \"It's complicated.\"\n\n \"That's not an answer,\" she fires back immediately.\n\n \"I guess you'll never know.\"\n\n Her brow furrows again, but this time there's concern behind it. She leans back a little, picking at the end of her sleeve. \"I knew something was going on, but I didn't think the secret was cheerleading. I thought you got yourself a girlfriend or were ditching school to get a tattoo.\"\n\n You snort. \"Would that be better?\"\n\n \"Probably not,\" Lily says, giggling. \"Mom would freak if you got a tattoo.\"\n\n The two of you sit there, the silence stretching a little. Her lips are pursed in a straight line as she fiddles with a loose thread on your blanket.\n\n Then she sighs. \"Okay. I've gotta think about this.\"\n\n You tense.\n\n \"Not in a bad way, don't worry,\" she adds quickly. \"I just can't believe you're like, flipping and smiling with glitter and yelling 'go team.' A girl needs some time to recalibrate.\"\n\n \"Take your time,\" you say, laughing at her comment.\n\n \"Are you good?\" she asks.\n\n \"Well, Jessica says I've got a lot of talent,\" you murmur.\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n \"There's my older sibling,\" Lily says, lightly punching your arm. Then, she slips off the bed, stealing one of your snacks from your nightstand. She starts heading for the door, then pauses, glancing back at you with something softer in her eyes. \"You're still a dork, though. Cheerleading or not.\"\n \n \n \"There's my older brother,\" Lily says, lightly punching your arm. Then, she slips off the bed, stealing one of your snacks from your nightstand. She starts heading for the door, then pauses, glancing back at you with something softer in her eyes. \"You're still a dork, though. Cheerleading or not.\"\n \n\n And with that, she walks out, leaving you alone in the dim quiet of your room, the mattress still warm where she'd been lying.\n \n \n You stare at the ceiling for a second too long.\n\n Lily's still watching you, eyes narrowed. Eventually, though, you let out a quiet breath and shake your head.\n \n \"There's nothing to tell,\" you say softly.\n\n Lily doesn't move. She just studies your face in the dim room. You can practically feel her gaze boring into you, like she's running a mental checklist of all the things that don't add up.\n\n \"Right,\" she says, flat and unimpressed.\n\n You glance over.\n\n She's already gotten up, her hair swinging beside her as she turns toward the door.\n\n \"You can keep your secrets, but I know something's going on,\" Lily states. \"You were gone for, like, ever tonight. People don't just vanish for three hours after a game ends unless they're doing something.\"\n\n You don't respond. You can't, really. Not without unraveling the whole thing.\n\n She grabs the doorknob and glances over her shoulder, eyes sharp.\n\n \"I'll figure it out eventually,\" she says.\n\n Then she walks out, closing the door behind her.\n\n You're left lying there, staring up at the ceiling again, her words still hanging in the air like a dare.\n \n \n \n\n[Choice: Time to sleep]",

Just a few weeks ago, you were still on summer break. Now it's time for one of the biggest events of your senior year. A part of you feels excited, but another part is nervous. You know that whatever happens tomorrow, it's going to be big.\n\n You close your eyes and drift off with the buzz of the game still echoing faintly in your ears.\n\n Tomorrow awaits.\n\n \n You lie in your bed without moving an inch, heartbeat still catching up to the quiet after the buzz of the night.\n\n The game replays in your mind in snapshots. The bright lights, roaring crowds, the steady rhythm of chants, the exhilarating leap into the final formation. You remember the way the grass felt under your shoes, how your breath synced with the beat of the music, how the energy from the stands wrapped around you like electricity. The scoreboard glowing with victory. The thud of your teammates' high fives.\n\n Then the bowling alley: neon lights and laughter, Roman's thick accent echoing through the hall, all the greasy food.\n\n You smile to yourself.\n\n Tomorrow, there'll be a party. And with that will come more noise, more chaos, and more memories. But for now, there's just the silence of your room, the hum of the world slowing down, and the weight of the day finally settling into your bones.\n\n You let your eyes drift shut and sleep finds you easily.\n \n\n[Choice: End of Content]\n \n [Choice: Try out the spectator variant]",

You can already imagine the chaos at school: pairs of friends showing up in matching outfits, holding matching props, laughing about it all.\n\n You let out a quiet breath and set your phone back down. There's really no need to force it. You'll just go as you are, enjoying the show from the sidelines.\n \n If anyone asks, you can make a joke about how you're just twinning with yourself this year.\n\n [Choice: Continue]",

Half of them are on the floor and the others stacked haphazardly against your dresser. Tissue paper sticks out from the tops like it's trying to show off what's inside.\n\nFor a moment, you just look at them.\n\nIt's stupid, but the sight makes you feel a little excited. You'd spent hours yesterday walking from store to store, trying things on, hearing the quiet yes in your head when something felt right. You'd brought them home, meaning to try them on again later, maybe see what kind of outfits you could throw together.\n\nYou pull one bag closer, fingertips brushing over the smooth, folded fabric inside. Something in you stirs at the thought of walking into school wearing one of these. How would the fabric feel? How would it move?\n\nAnd then your mind goes somewhere else entirely.\n\nPrincipal Thompson.\n\nThe memory is sharp and uncomfortable. Him in the office—sitting with that fake smile. You remember exactly what he said.\n\n\"Because if you do—even once—I'll be waiting. And I promise you, [name]. The next meeting won't be this polite.\"\n\nYou can already picture stepping into the building, barely making it to your locker before a voice calls you over the school PA system. If the first meeting you had with him was him being polite, you don't want to have another meeting.\n\nThe fabric slips from your hand back into the bag.\n\n\"Yeah... probably not a good idea,\" you murmur to yourself, stepping back from the pile. The air feels heavier somehow, like the room's gone from anticipation to quiet resignation in the space of a breath.\n\nYou're not sure if this makes you want to fight harder or breathe easier.\n\n[Choice: You feel disappointed]\n[Choice: You feel relieved]",

The thought had been sitting in the back of your mind since you got home yesterday. You've been imagining walking into school in something new, something that felt softer and lighter in all the right ways. Letting people see you in it. Maybe hearing a few compliments in the hallway, even if they were casual ones.\n\n That would make all of yesterday's soreness feel worth it.\n\n Instead, you're here, telling yourself not to. Not because you don't want to, but because you know exactly what would happen if you did. You can picture Principal Thompson's look from the other day, that menacing smile that didn't reach his eyes. The promise that he'd be \"watching.\" The threat of a formal disciplinary review.\n\n Your fingers brush the edge of one of the tops hanging over your chair. It feels nice, even better than you remember from the store. You let your hand rest there for a moment, imagining slipping it on, walking out the door without caring. You could do it. You want to do it.\n\n But wanting and doing are two completely different things.\n\n With a small sigh, you fold it neatly and set it back on the chair, giving the fabric one last glance before you turn a way. The bags will wait. They're not going anywhere.\n\n You cross the room and pull open your closet doors, eyes scanning for something \"normal.\" Something that won't get a second look, even if it's the last thing you feel like wearing.\n\n \n \n \n Yeah... honestly, it's better this way.\n\n You glance back at the bags, at the soft folds of fabric peeking out like they're trying to catch your attention, and feel a strange sort of relief wash over you. They can stay right there. Maybe for the weekend. Or for some other time when you don't have to deal with the whole school staring and Principal Thompson breathing down your neck.\n\n The truth is, you don't want to wear that stuff to school. Not really. It's not you. Not in the middle of crowded hallways, not with people looking at you strangely. That's the last thing you need.\n\n You breathe out, long and slow, and feel your shoulder unclench. Yeah. This is the right call.\n\n Turning toward your closet, you pull the door open, scanning for something familiar.\n\n Something that's just safe.\n \n\n \n \n You can wear whatever you want, but the characters won't recognize it and you'll canonically be wearing your usual clothes. I know maybe people were excited to show up at school in a dress, but that would severely mess up the game's pacing and kill the conflict that was introduced in Day 16.

      "text": "The morning air has a crisp bite to it as you step outside. The street's quiet except for the faint rustle of dead leaves scraping across the pavement, their edges catching little bursts of wind.\n\nAnd, as always, Luke is exactly where you expect him to be: planted on the sidewalk at the edge of your driveway, grinning widely.\n\n \n He's holding a Gladiraid bottle in one hand. It's blue. Your \"matching\" prop for Bestie Twinning Day.\n\n It's also... suspiciously empty-looking.\n\n \"Morning, [name]!\" he calls out, lifting the bottle in a triumphant little toast. \"Operation Twinning Hydration is live!\"\n\n You take one look at the way it's crinkled in his grip and realize what's happened.\n\n \"...You already drank it,\" you say.\n\n Luke blinks down at the bottle like it's brand-new information. \"Oh. Uh. Yeah.\"\n\n You pinch the bridge of your nose. \"Whatever. I should've known you'd do this. Just give me mine.\"\n\n For a moment, he just stares at you with a blank smile. Then the smile falters.\n\n \"Okay, so...\" he says slowly, dragging the words out like he's delivering bad news on live television. He reaches into his messenger bag and pulls out a second Gladiraid bottle.\n\n For a split second, you actually think maybe he redeemed himself. Then he hands it to you. It's light. Too light.\n\n You give it a little shake. There's no slosh. You can only hear the sad, hollow crackle of plastic.\n\n You look at him. \"Luke.\"\n\n He winces, flinching. \"Sorry...\"\n\n \"I didn't mean to!\" His words come rushing out, all earnest panic. \"I was just, y'know, walking over here. I was just so thirsty. And then I was holding both bottles, and I thought, 'Hey, matching! I should drink with [name] so it's like we're doing it together,' and then I finished mine and...\" He gestures vaguely, like the rest of the story tells itself.\n\n \"Luke, the only point of this was to match,\" you say.\n\n \"We're still matching!\" he says, brightening again. \"Look, we both have Gladiraid bottles! Empty ones! That's even more specific. How many people are going to show up with that?\"\n\n You just keep looking at him until he starts to look a little nervous.\n\n \"Fine, fine,\" he says quickly, jogging a couple steps to fall into place beside you as you start walking toward school. \"I'll buy you another one from the vending machine.\"\n\n \"You're buying me two,\" you say flatly.\n\n He holds up his hands like that's perfectly reasonable. \"Deal. And this time I'll only drink half. Maybe.\"\n\n You shake your head, but you can't quite stop the corner of your mouth from twitching upward. With anyone else, this would be annoying. With Luke... well, it's just another morning.\n\n \n \"Morning,\" he says, falling into step beside you the moment you reach him. \"You ready for Twinning Day?\"\n\n You give him a sideways look. \"You realize I'm not twinning with you, right?\"\n\n He gasps. \"What? Betrayal.\"\n\n \"I'm matching with Samantha,\" you say, and his expression instantly brightens again. It seems any excuse to see Samantha first thing in the morning is fine by him.\n\n You've made it down several blocks when you hear footsteps pounding the pavement from up ahead. You glance over just as Samantha rounds the corner, beanie bouncing, huffing like she's just run a marathon.\n\n Luke lights up. \"Samantha! You made it!\"\n\n She slows to a brisk walk, still catching her breath. \"Yeah. I ran the whole way,\" she manages between breaths. She tugs at her backpack strap, adjusting it higher on her shoulder, and then, with a little flourish, pulls out two crinkling bags of hot chips.\n\n \"Behold,\" she says, holding them up like they're some kind of prize. \"The ceremonial twin snack.\"\n\n Luke's eyes go wide. \"Are we opening them now? Can we open them now? Please tell me we're opening them now.\"\n\n \"Nope,\" Samantha says, tucking the bags under her arm. \"After school.\"\n\n \"Aw, come on,\" Luke groans. \"Just one chip. Just a single one.\"\n\n \"No.\"\n\n \"Half a chip?\"\n\n \"No.\"\n\n \"What if I just smell the bag—\"\n\n \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n Luke trails her on the opposite side from you, throwing out ridiculous suggestions. He comes up with splitting the bag in thirds \"for fairness,\" promises to \"mentally\" not eat them until after school, and even offers to carry the bags for her as if that would somehow help his case.\n\n Each time, Samantha shuts him down without hesitation, her replies just dry enough to make you laugh under your breath. She's not even looking at him half the time, just staring straight ahead with the bags tucked securely under her arm like precious cargo.\n\n By the time the school comes into view, Luke has cycled back around to his first request, starting again at \"just one chip,\" and Samantha hasn't budged an inch. The bags are still sealed. The twin snack is safe. And you're pretty sure Luke is going to be talking about it all day.\n\n \n \"Morning,\" he says, falling into step with you. \"Ready for the big day? You twinning with someone? Don't tell me it's—\"\n\n Before he can finish, the purr of an engine rolls up the street, smooth and expensive-sounding. You both turn your heads just in time to see a white car pull up beside the curb in front of your house. The driver's side window rolls down, and Jessica leans her elbow casually against the frame.\n\n Luke reacts like he's just spotted a celebrity in the wild. \"Woah!!! Hey, Jessica!\"\n\n She smirks faintly at his enthusiasm. \"Morning, Luke.\"\n\n The familiarity in her tone isn't surprising as they've been in the same orbit for years. Cheer captain and star football player; pep rallies and halftime shows make that inevitable. Luke, of course, takes it and runs with it, launching straight into conversation.\n\n \"Man, I've only seen this one a couple of times. Is this new? This is nice. You could probably fit, like, half the team in here. Does it have that big tablet in the middle? Wait... does it do that thing where it connects to your phone—\"\n\n Jessica laughs softly. \"It does both of those things, yes.\"\n\n Luke's already leaning a little closer to the window, eyes scanning the interior like he's cataloging every luxury feature. \"Man, if I had a car like this, I'd just... live in it. Sleep in the back seat, eat in the front seat, maybe put a grill in the trunk. Portable lifestyle.\"\n\n \"Sounds... practical,\" Jessica says.\n\n They're still chatting when something clicks in his head. He straightens, blinking like he's only just noticed the odd part of the situation.\n\n \"Wait, why are you even here?\"\n\n Jessica tilts her head toward you, her smile widening just a touch. \"I'm twinning with [name].\"\n\n Luke's gaze flicks to you. \"[name]?\"\n\n <<if [jessicaRomance] > 9>> \n \n Jessica shuts off the engine and steps out, swinging the car door closed with her hip. In her hand is a small sticker sheet with a variety of designs.\n\n \"Hold still,\" she says softly, peeling off a maroon heart and pressing it gently to your left cheek. Her fingers linger for a beat longer than necessary, and when you glance at her, she's smiling in that way she does when she's trying not to laugh.\n\n Then she takes a lavender heart for herself, sticking it just under her eye. \"Perfect,\" she giggles. \"Now we match... kind of.\"\n\n Luke, entirely oblivious to the undercurrent, just leans forward eagerly. \"Yo, I want a sticker too!\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow, but ends up peeling a random sticker off the sheet anyway. It's one that resembles a chicken nugget. She slaps it square onto the middle of his forehead. Luke beams like it's the best thing that's ever happened to him.\n \n \n \n Jessica shuts off the engine and steps out of the car. In her hand is a small sheet of gold start stickers, the kind that look like they belong on a teacher's desk.\n\n \"Here,\" she says, peeling one off and pressing it lightly to your left cheek. The adhesive is cool at first, the metallic surface catching the morning light. She takes another and sticks it to her own cheek.\n\n \"There,\" she says with an easy smile. \"Good friends.\"\n\n Luke's eyes lights up the second he sees the stickers. \"Wait, I want one!\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow, but ends up peeling another gold star off the sheet anyway. She places it square in the middle of his forehead. Luke beams like it's the best thing that's ever happened to him. \n \n\n Luke's still grinning at the sticker on his forehead when his attention snaps back to the car. His eyes go a little wide, like the thought just hit him.\n\n \"Yo... could we ride in your car?\" he asks, voice full of that hopeful energy that's hard to say no to.\n\n Jessica glances between the two of you, then smiles. \"Sure. Hop in.\"\n\n Luke lights up instantly. \"No way!\" He jogs around to the passenger side, yanking open the back door.\n\n You follow him in, sliding onto the leather seat that still smells faintly new. Luke sinks into the opposite side with a satisfied sigh, running his hand over the seat like he's checking the quality. \"Man... this is nice. This is really nice. It's like a couch that moves.\"\n\n Jessica laughs as she steps into the car and starts the engine. \"I'm glad to see you approve.\"\n\n \"I'm telling you, if I had a ride like this, I'd never walk anywhere again,\" Luke says. He's practically bouncing as the car eases away from the curb, his gaze darting from the tinted windows to the dashboard up first. \"School, practice, grocery store, whatever. It'd all be a road trip.\"\n\n You just shake your head, settling back against the seat as the quiet purr of the engine carries you toward school.\n\n \n \"Morning,\" he says, falling into step beside you. \"So—\"\n\n He doesn't get to finish, because a voice calls out from further up the street.\n\n \"[name]!\"\n\n You both turn to see Vincent jogging toward you, one hand gripping the strap of his backpack, the other clutching a neat little bundle of something. When he reaches you, a bit winded, he straightens and offers the bundle to you with a small smile.\n\n \"I, uh, brought the bookmarks,\" he says, holding them out. They're cut from thick cardstock, laminated, and decorated—two of them, one with painted constellations, the other with a koi fish gliding across a rippling blue background. \"One for you, one for me. I thought we could each carry one in our pockets, for... authenticity.\"\n\n Luke blinks at him. \"...Who are you?\"\n\n Vincent shifts his weight, clearing his throat. \"Vincent. We share East Asian History and, if I'm not mistaken, I had you in Gym last year. We also have lunch together. Though, admittedly, my table is usually in the corner. I'm a friend of [name]'s... or at least, I'd like to think so. Not unlike how the United States and the Soviet Union were technically allies in WW2, even if they didn't always share a table either.\"\n\n Luke stares at him for a moment longer. \"Bro, I didn't understand anything you just said.\"\n\n Vincent glances at you, clearly hoping for a little backup.\n\n You take the koi fish from him and hold it up. \"I'm matching with Vincent for Bestie Twinning Day.\"\n\n Luke looks between the two of you, squinting like he's trying to process the logic. \"...With... bookmarks?\"\n\n \"Yes,\" Vincent says, nodding earnestly. \"They're functional, portable, and aesthetically pleasing. Also, no one else will have anything remotely similar, which gives us the edge in originality. It's rather like the Byzantine Empire's use of Greek fire. Practical and unique, in part because the recipe for Greek fire was a state secret. Kind of how I keep my exact bookmark-making methods secret too.\"\n\n \"I'm so confused, dude,\" Luke says.\n\n Vincent tilts his head. \"Was it the Byzantine reference? Or have you not heard of Greek fire before? I can explain it to you if you—\"\n\n \"I thought it was like... that thing with the wooden horse? Y'know, they used it to like, burn down... Greece?\" Luke says, waving his hand vaguely.\n\n Vincent stares at him for a beat. \"That's mythology. Also it was said to have been used by the Greeks to enter the city of Troy. You're way off.\"\n\n Luke just shrugs. \"Same thing.\"\n\n Vincent turns to you with an expression of disbelief, clearly deciding it's not worth the energy to try and untangle Luke's version of history.\n\n \"Anyway, I'll keep the koi,\" you say, slipping it carefully into your pocket.\n\n Vincent smiles faintly and takes the constellation one for himself. \"Then I'll keep the stars. It's good for navigation—figuratively and literally.\" There's a lightness in his tone, but you can tell he means it.\n\n The three of you start toward school, the cool morning air filling the quiet. Or at least it would be quiet, if Luke wasn't immediately leaning over to Vincent.\n\n \"So, like,\" Luke starts, already sounding way too invested, \"what's your favorite war? Top three, if you can't pick one.\"\n\n Vincent barely hesitates. \"Well, that depends entirely on how you define 'favorite.' If we're talking purely from a strategic perspective, the Punic Wars are fascinating. I'm particularly a fan of the Second one, with Hannibal's crossing of the Alps. From a political impact standpoint, though, you really can't beat the Napoleonic Wars; the sheer scale of redrawing Europe's borders was—\"\n\n Luke interrupts, brow furrowed. \"Wait, wait. Did people actually wear those metal bucket hats? Like in the movie?\"\n\n Vincent blinks, recalibrates, and drives straight into the tangent. \"Ah, so helmets. You're probably thinking of the great helms used in the late medieval period. They were, in fact, worn in battle, but they had limited visibility and airflow, which is why you often saw knights lifting them between arguments. Eventually, they evolved into more open-faced designs like the bascinet, which—\"\n\n \"Wait, but you said Napoleon,\" Luke cuts in again. \"What's the deal with him anyway? Everyone says he was really short.\"\n\n By now, Vincent's in full lecture mode, hands gesturing as he talks. \"That's largely a misconception. He was around 169 centimeters, which was average for his time. The myth of him being short comes from a mix-up between French and English measurement systems, and British propaganda painting him as a 'small man' in both stature and character. It's actually a perfect example of how public perception can be shaped by—\"\n\n \"I'm bored,\" Luke says, yawning. \"Do you watch sports, Victor?\"\n\n You can't help but chuckle under your breath as Vincent sighs.\n\n \n \"Alright,\" he says as you both start toward school, \"who'd you end up twinning with?\"\n\n You just smirk and keep walking. \"You'll see.\"\n\n \"Aw, come on,\" Luke groans. \"Don't make it sound all dramatic.\"\n\n Before you can answer, a faint rustling breaks the stillness behind you. It's not the casual crunch of leaves in the wind. it's heavier and more deliberate, like someone is stepping through them. Both of you slow and glance over your shoulders.\n\n Aurora is there.\n\n She's standing half in shadow behind a tree, the morning light cutting across her in strange, broken patterns. She's dressed in her usual dark outfit and in her hand she carries something pale.\n\n Luke lets out a strangled yell. He stumbles sideways, pushing you between himself and her like you're a human shield. \"What the hell, man!\" he blurts, eyes wide.\n\n You rub the back of your neck, trying not to laugh. \"Relax. I asked her to match with me for Bestie Twinning Day.\"\n\n Luke freezes, still clutching your arm like a lifeline. \"You what?\"\n\n \"She's my match,\" you repeat, keeping your voice casual.\n\n He leans in toward you, clearly aiming for a whisper, but it's way too loud. \"Why her???\" The sharpness of it makes you flinch, the sound hitting your ear like a small sonic boom.\n\n You instinctively pull away, rubbing your ear. \"Ow. You're not as quiet as you think you are.\"\n\n Luke's still half-hiding behind you when his eyes dart to Aurora's hands. His grip tightens. \"Dude... what is that?\"\n\n Aurora's gaze drifts down to her own hands, like she's just been reminded she's carrying something. She slowly tilts her palm upward, letting the pale, ridged curve of the object catch the sunlight. \"A seashell,\" she says in that measured way she talks, as if every word is placed exactly where he wants it. \"It still remembers the ocean if you listen close enough.\"\n\n \"...Ok...\" he says, still clearly suspicious.\n\n Aurora studies him for another heartbeat, her expression unreadable. \"You've never held one?\"\n\n \"Not one that looked like that,\" Luke mutters.\n\n Her lips curl faintly at the corners. \"Maybe you should. It might like you.\"\n\n \"Yeah, I'm good,\" Luke says quickly, leaning a fraction more behind you.\n\n Aurora watches him for a moment longer before suddenly stepping forward and saying, \"Boo.\"\n\n Luke's yell is so loud it echoes down the quiet street. He jumps back a full step, nearly tripping over a rock.\n\n Aurora's laughter slips out, warm and genuine despite her otherwise composed demeanor. She tips her head back slightly as it fades, the purple tips of her hair shifting against her shoulder. \"I couldn't resist,\" she says, almost like an admission, but there's a glint of mischief in her eyes. \"You make it too easy.\"\n\n \"Not cool,\" Luke grumbles.\n \n Aurora ignores him entirely, turning her attention back to you. She steps close and holds the seashell out. Up close, it's smoother than you expected, with faint pink swirls inside its ridges, still warm from being in her hands. \"For the match,\" she says simply.\n\n The three of you set off toward school. Aurora walks at your side, her pace unhurried, occasionally brushing her fingertips over the sleeves of her top. She makes an idle comment about the light being \"the right kind\" this morning. You're not sure what that means, but you're used to her cryptic comments by now.\n\n Luke stays behind at first, a single step, then two. The moment Aurora glances his way, he drifts back further, pretending to dig for something in your backpack. By the time the school comes into view, he's several feet behind, trailing like a reluctant kid. Aurora notices, and for a brief moment, there's the faintest flicker of a smile.\n\n \n \"Morning!\" he calls, jogging toward you. \"You've gotta tell me who your twin for today is. I've been thinking about it all night, and I'm not gonna guess wrong again.\"\n\n He stops mid-ramble when he sees the tall figure coming up the sidewalk from the opposite direction.\n\n Jordan Brooks. Star quarterback. Hands in his varsity jacket pockets and wearing that serious expression that has the school convinced he's impossible to approach.\n\n Luke's grin freezes. His eyes ping-pong between you and Jordan like he's trying to make sense of it. \"Uh... why is he here?\"\n\n \"I'm matching with him for Bestie Twinning Day,\" you say simply.\n\n Luke's mouth drops open. \"What? How did you get Jordan to agree to that?!\" He waves his arms for emphasis. \"I've been on the same football team as this guy for four years and I think he's said, like... seven words to me. Total.\"\n\n By now Jordan's close enough to hear, and there's the faintest tightening in his jaw. His eyes flick to Luke briefly before returning to you. \"Didn't know you'd have company,\" he says evenly.\n\n \"I walk with him every day,\" you explain.\n\n There's a pause, then Jordan exhales, like he's made up his mind about something. \"...Alright. Guess it's fine.\"\n\n \"That's it?\" Luke asks, blinking. \"No 'get lost'? No scary silent treatment?\"\n\n Jordan huffs out a low laugh, shaking his head. \"You've got this whole image of me in your head, huh?\"\n\n \"I mean... yeah?\" Luke says, grinning. \"You're, like, the cool mysterious guy. You never say anything unless it's, like, a touchdown call or telling someone to run faster.\"\n\n \"Maybe I didn't have a reason to,\" Jordan says, glancing at you briefly before adding, \"It's going to be a long walk. No point making it awkward.\"\n\n Luke's grin widens. \"Yo... he's talking to me. Like, he's actually talking to me.\"\n\n Jordan smirks faintly. \"Don't get used to it.\" His voice has that teasing edge, but there's no coldness in it. It's more like he's humoring Luke in a way he usually wouldn't bother to do.\n\n The three of you start walking, your footsteps in sync. Luke, still buzzing from Jordan's unexpected friendliness, keeps firing off questions. They're random, of course; about practice, about the next game, and even about whether Jordan thinks the school vending machines are broken on purpose. And instead of brushing him off, Jordan actually answers. Curtly, sure, but with the occasional dry comment that makes Luke laugh way too loud for the quiet street.\n\n Every few steps, Luke gives you this wide-eyed look like he can't believe this is happening, before turning back to Jordan with yet another question.\n\n Jordan listens, patient in his own understated way, his hands still in his pockets... and then his fingers shift like he's reaching for something. His stride slows, and there's a flicker of hesitation in his expression. Finally, he exhales, pulls his hand free, and holds out two small, timeworn ticket stubs.\n\n They're worn soft at the edges, the ink a little faded, but it's obvious they've been kept with care.\n\n \"I figured this would work,\" Jordan says. \"One for you, one for me. That way we're matching without making a big show of it.\"\n\n He separates them carefully. The one he keeps says The Glass Managerie—Tennessee Williams in a neat serif font. The one he hands you reads The Importance of Being Earnest—Oscar Wilde.\n\n \"You really kept these, huh?\" you ask, turning yours over in your hand.\n\n \"Yeah.\" His voice is quieter now. \"I've been to a lot of plays. I don't... really tell people that.\" His jaw tenses again, but not in annoyance. It's the way he gets when something matters to him more than he wants to admit. \"Football's what everyone sees. Theater's... for me. Always has been.\"\n\n There's a pause before he adds, \"The Menagerie one is about holding onto things you can't always keep. It hit me, back when I first saw it. And Earnest is about being honest about who you are, even if you've been pretending otherwise. Thought it might fit.\"\n\n You catch the way his eyes flick to yours, just briefly, as if to see if you understand what he's really saying.\n\n Luke, who's been listening with his usual curiosity, leans in. \"Wait, these are for plays?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" Jordan says hesitantly.\n\n \"Bro, that's so cool,\" Luke blurts without hesitation.\n\n Jordan looks over at him like he's not sure if Luke's joking. \"You... think so?\"\n\n \"Yeah!\" Luke grins. \"Plays are like live movies, right? But way harder 'cause you can't mess up. That's sick. I've never been to one, but that sounds awesome.\"\n\n Jordan's posture loosens further. \"Guess I always figured people would just see it as weird. Doesn't exactly fit the quarterback image.\"\n\n \"Man, who cares?\" Luke asks, shrugging. \"Sounds way more interesting than what the other guys argue about in the locker room.\"\n\n A faint smile appears on Jordan's face. \"Maybe.\"\n\n \n \"Yo!\" he grins, falling into step beside you almost immediately. \"So, who's the lucky bestie you're matching with today? It's gonna be epic.\"\n\n You hesitate. \"I'm actually not matching with anyone.\"\n\n Luke stops, his sneakers scuffing against the pavement. \"Wait, what? Brooo...\" His face falls. \"You could've asked me! We could've been, like... peanut butter and jelly, or SpongeBob and Patrick, or—\"\n\n \"I dunno,\" you cut in, shrugging. \"Just not feelin' it this year.\"\n\n Luke makes a devastated noise. \"Man, you're killing me. We could've crushed it. The ultimate duo. Everyone would've been jealous.\"\n\n \"Guess we'll never know,\" you mumble.\n \n\n[Choice: To school!]",

      "text": "The two of you make your way toward Pacific Crest High. Luke's in a good mood, even though he showed up with two empty Gladiraid bottles as your Bestie Twinning props. Every few steps, he flips his bottle into the air like he's practicing some kind of bottle-flipping stunt, catching it just in time to keep it from hitting the ground.\n\n \"So, do you think people are actually gonna get it?\" he says, tossing it again. \"That we're matching, I mean. Or are they gonna think we just... both showed up with sports drinks?\"\n\n You glance at him. \"You mean, are they going to think we both showed up with empty sports drinks?\"\n\n He grins like that's a fair point. \"Yeah, maybe it's, like... performance art. Symbolic. We can say we're doing dehydration awareness or something.\"\n\n You roll your eyes.\n\n As you round the corner onto the school block, the building's front steps are already buzzing. Luke falls into a jog for no reason other than to beat you to the door.\n\n \"You think they'd show our picture on the Spirit Week board if we win?\" he asks, holding the door open for you.\n\n \"I don't think they give prizes for Spirit Week,\" you say stepping inside.\n\n \"They should,\" he insists. \"Like a gift card or something. Free food could work. Or—\"\n\n You've stopped listening because the vending machine by the attendance office catches your eye. Rows of snacks, gum, and most importantly, perfectly chilled bottles of blue Gladiraid, all lined up in the middle row like they're mocking the empty one in your bag.\n\n You nod toward it. \"Alright. Make it up to me. Go grab me one of those.\"\n\n Luke freezes mid-step. \"Uh... I don't know about that.\"\n\n \"What do you mean you don't know about that?\" you ask, narrowing your eyes. \"You promised you'd buy me one at lunch. Two, actually.\"\n\n \"Yeah, about that,\" Luke says, gaze darting away. \"I may have... slightly exaggerated my current financial situation.\"\n\n \"Meaning?\" you press.\n\n \"Meaning... I don't have any money,\" he admits, wincing like he's bracing for impact.\n\n You let out a long sigh, staring at the tile floor. \"Fine. You can pay me back later. But seriously, Luke—\"\n\n When you look up again, he's gone. Completely gone. No footsteps, no glimpse of his jacket in the crowd, not even the sound of his voice somewhere down the hall. One second he's standing there making excuses, the next it's like he evaporated into thin air.\n\n You glance around, scanning the stream of students filing toward their lockers, but there's no trace of him. Somehow, in the ten seconds you looked away, he's managed to vanish without a trace.\n\n \"Unbelievable,\" you mutter, pressing your palm against your face.\n\n With no twin and still no drink, you shoulder your backpack and head down the hall, resigned to starting the day already down a Gladiraid and one best friend.\n\n \n The three of you cut across the last block toward Pacific Crest High, the air cool but bright with a warm edge. Samantha's got the two unopened bags of hot chips tucked firmly under one arm. Luke is trailing behind like a kicked puppy, his head bowed and his hands shoved deep into his pockets.\n\n You glance back at him. \"You're still sulking?\"\n\n \"I'm not sulking,\" Luke says, though it's the exact tone of someone who is absolutely sulking. \"I've made my peace with it.\"\n\n Samantha doesn't even slow her pace. \"No you haven't. You've sighed twelve times in the last five minutes. I counted.\"\n\n \"She's right,\" you say, smirking. \"That's a lot of sighing for someone who's supposedly 'at peace.'\"\n\n Luke looks up just enough to glare at you both. \"I'm just saying, if someone really cared about me, they'd let me have some hot chips.\"\n\n \"You've been running the same line since we met up with Samantha,\" you say, scoffing. \"If it hasn't worked by now, it's not gonna.\"\n\n \"Sometimes, you've gotta plant the seed and let it grow,\" Luke murmurs.\n\n Samantha finally glances at him, the corner of her mouth twitching. \"Do you seriously want one that bad?\"\n\n Luke's eyes go wide. \"Yes. Absolutely. More than I've ever wanted anything in my whole life.\"\n\n Samantha stops walking, pulls one bag from under her arm, and rips it open. She holds it out to him. \"Fine. But one hot chip. One. Singular. As in, the number of brain cells you have left after playing football without a helmet that one time.\"\n\n Luke nods solemnly before immediately plunging his entire hand deep into the bag. It comes out with a mountain of chips. He shovels the entire pile into his mouth in one go, crunching loud enough to make a kid on the other side of the street turn and look.\n\n \"Luke!\" you say, laughing. \"You took a quarter of the bag.\"\n\n He's already chewing happily, red dust on the corners of his mouth. \"Mmf. Worth it.\"\n\n \"This is on me,\" Samantha says, shaking her head. \"I fell for the emotional manipulation. Textbook case.\"\n\n \"Nah, it's on both of us,\" you correct. \"We underestimated how smart Luke gets when it involves food.\"\n\n Luke swallows and grins. \"You and Sam are the best best friends ever.\"\n\n \"Best best friends?\" you repeat.\n\n \"Yep. That's above regular best friends. That's the premium package. That's the—\"\n\n Samantha cuts him off with a wave of her hand. \"Finish that sentence and you're carrying my books for a week.\"\n\n Luke zips his lips with an exaggerated motion, though his grin stays plastered on. You shake your head as the school comes into view. Samantha now guards the two bags like treasure, while Luke looks like he's just pulled off a major heist.\n\n You're not sure whether you should laugh or pretend you don't know either of them.\n\n \n Jessica's car hums smoothly along the road, the morning light flashing across the polished white hood every time you pass between trees. The air inside smells faintly of something expensive. Luke is next to you in the backseat, sprawled out. His chin is tilted upward and his eyes are straining toward the ceiling. You watch him for a second before asking, \"What are you doing?\"\n\n \"Dude, I'm trying to see the sticker,\" he says without breaking concentration. \"The one on my forehead.\"\n\n You blink at him. \"Luke... that's not possible. Eyes don't work that way.\"\n\n \"Maybe not yours,\" he says confidently, still staring upward like his sheer voice of will might make his vision loop back onto itself. \"But if I try long enough, I might get it. I think I saw a little bit of it just now.\"\n\n \"You didn't,\" you say, rolling your eyes.\n\n \"Pretty sure I did.\" He leans even farther back, trying to cross his eyes upward. \"Like, a little blur. That's gotta be the sticker.\"\n\n Jessica glances at him in the mirror with a faint smirk. \"You know, there's a much easier way to check. It's called your phone camera.\"\n\n \"Nah,\" Luke says, still squinting at the ceiling. \"I'm committed now.\"\n\n You shake your head and turn toward Jessica. \"I'm honestly afraid he's gonna strain something if we let him keep going.\"\n\n \"Wouldn't be the first time,\" Luke mutters, still tilting his head at an awkward angle. Then, as if the thought just popped into his head, he drops his gaze and leans forward. \"So... how did you two even get to know each other? I mean, really know each other?\"\n\n \"We first really met because we got paired up in homeroom as buddies. It was supposed to help everyone get to know someone they might not have talked to otherwise. Things... just went from there.\"\n\n You nod.\n\n Luke grins. \"That's cool. I actually became friends with my homeroom buddy too.\"\n\n \"Yeah?\" Jessica asks. \"Who is it?\"\n\n Luke freezes. His eyes flick up toward the ceiling again, but this time it's not for the sticker. It's because he's thinking really hard. \"Uh... I forgot his name.\"\n\n \"You forgot your buddy's name?\" Jessica asks, laughing softly.\n\n Luke shrugs like it's no big deal. \"I know his face, though. We sit next to each other every morning. It's fine.\"\n\n Jessica laughs and you sigh.\n\n \n The three of you are nearly at school. Vincent falls into a measured pace like he's mapping every step in advance. Luke, on the other hand, bounces from curb to curb, occasionally stepping on a crack like it's some sort of challenge.\n\n \"So, uh, Victor—\"\n\n \"Vincent,\" he corrects, already resigned.\n\n \"Right, right. Why haven't I seen you around school much?\" Luke asks, squinting at him like Vincent might just disappear if he looks away.\n\n Vincent glances over. \"Well, that all depends on your schedule. What classes are you taking this year?\"\n\n Luke stares blankly ahead, mouth slightly open. \"...Uh...\"\n\n \"Perhaps start with your mathematics course,\" Vincent says, adjusting his grip on his backpack. \"Which one are you in?\"\n\n \"Algebra, I think.\"\n\n \"Algebra 2?\" Vincent questions.\n\n \"1.\"\n\n Vincent stops mid-step. \"That's typically reserved for middle school students or freshmen.\"\n\n Luke's eyes widen like Vincent just revealed a life-altering secret. \"Ohh, so that's why everyone in my class is so young! I thought it was just some weird coincidence.\"\n\n \"Yeah, Luke,\" you state, snorting. \"Totally random.\"\n\n Vincent shakes his head with a small sigh, but keeps walking. \"And your English class? Are you in AP Literature, Honors, or the standard track?\"\n\n Luke brightens a little. \"I'm with this random Indian kid.\"\n\n Vincent blinks, caught between curiosity and mild concern. \"...Would that be the ESL course, by chance?\"\n\n \"Yeahhh,\" Luke says, perking up. \"That's it!\"\n\n Vincent glances at you for confirmation, and you shrug. \"You might wanna explain that to him before he starts thinking it's some kind of secret club.\"\n\n \"ESL stands for 'English as a Second Language,'\" Vincent begins, obliging. \"It's generally for students who aren't native English speakers. The curriculum tends to be simplified—less complex literature, more foundational grammar.\"\n\n Luke frowns. \"Simplified? Dude, it's pretty hard to me...\"\n\n \"Luke, if you think that's hard, I'd love to see you try AP Lit for a week,\" you laugh, shaking your head.\n\n \"I'd light it up cos it's lit!\" Luke says.\n\n Vincent decides to just drop the subject. \"Well... maybe in college.\"\n\n By the time the school comes into view, Luke's long given up on figuring Vincent out, but you can tell he's already planning his next round of questions. Vincent, on the other hand, looks like he's bracing himself for it.\n\n \n Aurora walks just close enough that her shadow brushes the edge of yours, but her gaze stays forward, unreadable as always.\n\n Luke, however, has drifted so far behind you're surprised he's still keeping up. When you glance back, he's keeping several yards between himself and Aurora, his eyes flicking toward her like she might sprout bat wings at any moment.\n\n Aurora doesn't even need to look. She just knows. Her voice carries over the quiet morning, low and matter-of-fact. \"Relax, I'm not going to hex you or anything.\"\n\n Luke stops dead in his tracks, his sneakers scraping the concrete. \"You can do that???\"\n\n Aurora finally turns her head just enough for you to catch a faint glimmer of amusement. \"If I wanted to, sure.\"\n\n Luke's eyes widen like she just admitted to owning a pet tarantula the size of a dinner plate. Without another word, he pivots hard and bolts toward the strip of woods running alongside the street. \"I'll just... get to school on my own!\" he shouts over his shoulder, his voice getting fainter as branches snap under his shoes.\n\n You stare after him for a beat, then sigh. \"You realize he's probably going to get lost, right?\"\n\n Aurora doesn't break her stride, her gaze forward again. \"You have an interesting friend.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"You get used to it after a while. It's kind of his thing.\"\n\n To your surprise, she actually laughs.\n\n You blink at her. \"Huh. I didn't think you.. did that.\"\n\n \"Don't get used to it,\" she says lightly, though the corner of her mouth has't quite stopped curving.\n\n \n You, Luke, and Jordan head down the familiar sidewalk toward Pacific Crest High School. Jordan walks on your right, tall and composed. To your surprise, he's actually responding to Luke's barrage of questions.\n\n Luke, of course, is thriving. \"Okay, serious question for you. When you throw a pass, do you, like, aim, or is it more of a vibe thing?\"\n\n \"Aim,\" Jordan states. \"Always.\"\n\n Luke nods like this is groundbreaking wisdom. \"Right, right, aim. That makes sense. But then what about when you're running? You can't aim while running, right? That's gotta be pure vibe.\"\n\n Jordan's mouth twitches, like he's holding back a smirk. \"You can aim while running. It's just harder.\"\n\n \"Dude... that's crazy,\" Luke says, impressed. \"Okay, how about your fastest sprint time? And do you count in yards or meters? 'Cause Coach always says meters, but I think in yards, and it messes me up.\"\n\n Jordan answers each question calmly, without sounding annoyed. He answers in short sentences, sure, but doesn't shut Luke down. \"Yards in football, meters in track. I don't run track. Forty-yard dash is the standard.\"\n\n \"Woah. That's like... forty meters, right?\" Luke's eyes widen at his own math.\n\n \"Close enough,\" Jordan says, an amused edge to his voice.\n\n You glance between them, a little baffled at how not frosty Jordan is being today.\n\n Luke turns to you, lowering his voice in what he thinks is a whisper. \"Bro... how did you get to know him?\"\n\n \"I dunno,\" you say, shrugging. \"I kinda just did.\"\n\n Luke stares like you just said you've been keeping a pet dragon in your backyard. \"You're a wizard.\"\n\n Jordan lets out a soft breath, clearly having overheard everything.\n\n Still not done, Luke swings back toward him. \"So, does this mean you're gonna talk more during football practice now? Because you're usually like a brick wall. A really athletic brick wall, but still a wall.\"\n\n Jordan's lips quirk in the faintest smile, and the three of you keep walking, Luke firing off a few more questions. He asks about favorite plays, if Jordan's ever been tackled so hard he forgot his name, whether he's ever thought about playing another sport, and more. Jordan actually answers, with just enough words to keep Luke's energy going strong. You walk alongside them, equal parts amused and impressed, because this is a very important moment for Luke.\n\n \n \n By the time you and Luke reach Pacific Crest High, the crowd thickens. Every single one of them is matching.\n\n Luke's eyes go wide. \"Bro. This is on you. You could've been a part of this.\"\n\n You scan the scene: two guys wearing giant inflatable hot dog suits, a pair of girls dressed like popcorn, and two guys in full-on Victorian gowns. Someone in a banana suit walks next to a friend in a gorilla costume. It's insane.\n\n \"Meh,\" you say, shrugging. \"Didn't want to.\"\n\n Luke throws his hands up, nearly hitting a passing student dressed as a horse. \"You didn't want to?! Look at that!\" He points to two kids in massive foam dice costumes, rolling themselves across the grass. \"That could've been us!\"\n\n \"And risk suffocating before first period?\" you ask, deadpan. \"Hard pass.\"\n\n Luke groans and shakes his head. \"Man, this is tragic. Absolutely tragic.\"\n\n You just smirk and keep walking.\n \n\n[Choice: Homeroom]",

Ms. Carter is perched at her desk, sorting through a small mountain of papers. She hasn't called for silence yet, which gives the room that restless buzz it tends to have before the day officially starts.\n\n \n Jessica is already in the desk next to you, spinning her pen absently between her fingers. She's in her usual outfit, but you can tell something's a little different today. Her knee's bouncing and she keeps glancing in your general direction.\n\n \"Hey,\" Jessica says, turning halfway in her chair to face you. She brushes a loose strand of hair behind her ear. \"So. Still no new recruit.\"\n\n You glance up from your phone. \"Yeah?\"\n\n Jessica nods, lips pursed, like she's trying not to let her frustration show. \"Coach Moore texted me this morning. The freshman we were gonna try out backed out. Something about 'being more of a band kid than a flyer.'\" She lifts her hands in mock defeat. \"Which, you know, fair. But also, arghhh.\"\n\n You offer a sympathetic noise, and she exhales sharply through her nose before continuing.\n\n \"Anyway, I'm really sorry,\" she says, dropping her voice a notch, her gaze flicking briefly around the class like she's making sure no one else is eavesdropping. \"But that probably means you're stuck with us again for the game today.\"\n\n You can tell she doesn't like asking, but also knows you're the only person who can fill the gap without everything falling apart. You're not exactly a seasoned cheerleader, but you've learned enough to keep up. The team clearly trusts you as well.\n\n Still, you don't make it a big deal. \"It's fine,\" you say with a shrug. \"I just wanted to help.\"\n\n Jessica smiles at that. \"You always say that like it's no big deal. But if you think about it, it kinda is. You saved our asses last time.\"\n\n \"Well, someone had to,\" you say, glancing over at her. \"And you asked nicely.\"\n\n \"Pfft. You make it sound like I had a choice,\" she says. \"But seriously. You really handled it well. Like, better than I expected, even. You're a natural.\"\n\n She pauses, then glances sideways at you, her expression shifting just slightly. The teasing fades, replaced by something quieter. A question forming.\n\n \"I mean... it wasn't just the routine,\" she says, thinking out loud now. \"You stuck around for practices, talked with the team, actually gave feedback. You even put up with Mia. That's, like, a miracle on its own.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath. \"She's not that bad.\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow. \"She's so smug about everything. That's not normal.\"\n\n \"Okay, fair,\" you reply.\n\n She falls quiet again for a moment, fiddling with the edge of a sticker on her water bottle. Her brows knit, almost like she's trying to decide if she wants to say something.\n\n Then she turns her head to look at you directly, her voice a little softer.\n\n \"[name], do you actually like being on the cheer squad?\" she asks. \"Or not?\"\n\n [Choice: I like it]\n [Choice: I don't like it]\n\n \n Jessica is already in the desk next to you, spinning her pen absently between her fingers. She's in her usual outfit, but you can tell something's a little different today. Her posture is tighter, her knee bounces and slightly, and every so often she glances toward the window like she's working something over in her head.\n\n She turns halfway in her chair, her voice quiet enough to keep the conversation between you two. \"So,\" she starts, drawing out the word like she's bracing herself, \"we still haven't found a replacement yet.\"\n\n You tilt your head. \"For the squad?\"\n\n She nods, letting out a sharp sigh through her nose. \"Yeah. And it's really not great timing. Today's the homecoming game, and we've been running with a gap in the formation for ages now. Everyone's adjusted, but it still feels... wrong. Unbalanced.\"\n\n Her gaze dips to the edge of her desk before she looks back at you. \"I've done big games before, but homecoming's different. Packed stand, band going all out, half the alumni deciding to 'drop by...'\" She lets out a humorless laugh. \"All eyes on us, and meanwhile I'm hoping no one notices we're short a person.\"\n\n There's a beat where she hesitates, her expression uncertain. Then she glances at you more directly, like she's finally decided to just ask the thing that's been hanging between you since she turned around.\n\n \"You think it's gonna go well?\"\n\n [Choice: Of course]\n [Choice: I don't think so]",

      "text": "\"I actually like cheerleading,\" you say.\n\n Jessica's eyes widen, like she wasn't sure what she was going to hear and had already braced herself for the worst.\n\n \"I didn't really expect to,\" you go on, voice thoughtful. \"At first I thought I was just doing it to help you out. And I mean... I was. But then practices were kinda fun. Everyone was nicer than I thought they'd be. The games were nerve-wracking, yeah, but performing was actually kinda cool? Like this whole rush I didn't know I liked.\"\n\n \"So yeah,\" you say, meeting her blue eyes. \"I actually like it. A lot.\"\n\n For a second, Jessica just stares at you with her lips parted slightly. Then she lets out a long, slow sigh of relief and leans back in her seat, dramatically clutching her chest like she just narrowly avoided a heart attack.\n\n \"Thank God,\" she mutters, shaking her head with a laugh. \"You have no idea how worried I was that you secretly hated it and were just too polite to tell me.\"\n\n \"Jessica, did you see how enthusiastic I was?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow. \"I'd have to have, like, cheerleading Stockholm syndrome.\"\n\n She giggles at that, her shoulders finally relaxing. \"I know! But I just kept thinking maybe you were gonna burn out or ghost us one day. You were way too chill about everything.\"\n\n You smirk. \"What, you wanted me to complain more?\"\n\n \"No, but I needed something to prove you were human.\"\n\n \"Nah, I'm good,\" you say, chuckling. \"Besides, it's fun hanging out with the squad and being kinda good at something.\"\n\n Jessica nudges your arm with her elbow. \"More than 'kinda.' You've been great. Like, actually great. You picked everything up insanely quickly.\"\n\n \"Well, thanks for tricking me into joining, I guess,\" you say with a small smile.\n\n She grins. \"I didn't trick you. I simply invited you to watch us practice when you were emotionally vulnerable.\"\n\n \"Oh, that makes it better.\"\n\n \"Face it, [name],\" Jessica says. \"I've officially turned you into a cheerleader.\"\n\n You groan softly but can't hide your grin. \"God. Don't say it like that.\"\n \n \n \n \n The quiet between you and Jessica stretches a little too long after her question. You glance down at the desk for a second. There's no avoiding the question, at least not with how genuine her question sounded.\n\n \"...I don't really like it,\" you admit, voice low but even. \"Cheering, I mean.\"\n\n Jessica's eyes widen.\n\n You lift your shoulders in a small shrug, trying to soften the blow. \"It's not terrible or anything. And I don't regret doing it. But I didn't join because I wanted to be a cheerleader or anything like that.\"\n\n You glance over at her, and when your eyes meet, you add, a little quieter, \"I did it because I wanted to help you.\"\n\n Jessica blinks. \"You... really?\"\n\n \"Yeah. You were clearly stressed, you needed someone fast, and I figured I could survive a few games.\" You offer a dry chuckle. \"It's not like I had anything better to do. And it was kind of nice seeing you not completely panicking after the first routine went okay.\"\n\n Jessica stares at you, lips parted slightly, like her words are still processing. Then she closes her mouth and presses her fingers to her temple.\n\n \"Oh my God,\" she mutters. \"I feel like an actual villain.\"\n\n You blink. \"You're not.\"\n\n \"I am, though.\" She leans forward across her desk, dropping her voice but speaking quickly. \"I totally steamrolled you into this. Like, what I thought was 'oh [name] will do it, he's nice, he's always nice.' I didn't even stop to think about whether you were enjoying any of it. I just... I needed help, and you were there, and I didn't think past that.\"\n\n \"It's not like you forced me.\"\n\n \"Still,\" she sighs. \"That's a crap reason to keep someone doing something they don't like.\"\n\n You shake your head, gently. \"I said I'd do it because I wanted to help. That's still true. And I did want to be there. For you.\"\n\n Jessica presses her lips together, looking down at her notebook for a second before looking back up at you. There's a furrow in her brow and a twist in her expression that signifies both guilt and gratitude.\n\n \"I'm gonna find someone else,\" she says quietly but firmly. \"Like, actually this time. I didn't realize you felt like this. If I had, I never would've let it go on this long.\"\n\n \"I wasn't gonna just leave you hanging when the season was just about to start,\" you say.\n\n \"I know. That's why I feel even worse.\"\n\n She lets out a long breath, watching you for a moment. She doesn't say anything else, but there's a weight in her silence. Something still lingering that she hasn't quite said yet. Something she's turning over in her head.\n\n But for now, she just looks forward again, her shoulders a little tenser than before.\n \n\n \n \n \n \"Of course,\" you say, leaning forward slightly.\n\n Jessica blinks, a bit caught off guard by the certainty in your tone. Her lips curve into a tentative smile, like she wants to believe you but still needs a second to let it sink in. \"You really think so?\"\n\n You meet your eyes. speaking without hesitation. \"You'll make it work, Jessica. If anyone can do it, it's you.\"\n\n Her shoulders relax just a fraction, that tension in her posture easing. She lets out a soft breath and shakes her head like she's trying to hide how much it means to hear that. \"God, I needed that,\" she admits, her smile widening.\n\n \"You've been practicing for weeks,\" you add. \"I've seen you pull things together when it looked impossible. I've seen how you handle things when people are counting on you.\"\n\n \"You're a better pep talker than half of the people on my squad,\" Jessica states. \"Maybe I should drag you to practice sometime.\"\n\n \"Not a chance,\" you say quickly, though there's a glint of a grin at the corners of your mouth.\n\n Jessica chuckles, but her eyes soften. She lets out an exhale of relief as she leans back in her chair. She doesn't say anything else, but the way her smile lingers tells you you've done something good just by believing in her.\n \n \n \n You lean back slightly in your seat, shrugging in a way that's meant to be casual but comes out a little too blunt. \"I don't think so.\"\n\n The effect is instant. Jessica's face shifts as her mouth presses into a thin line and the faint spark in her eyes dims. She doesn't roll her eyes or snap back, doesn't even look offended. It's more like you just confirmed the worry she'd been trying to keep from showing too much.\n\n You realize immediately how flat it must have sounded. \"I mean, I just meant you're down a person, so... y'know, it's not really your fault,\" you start, words tumbling over themselves. \"It's just the reality, right? Doesn't mean you won't still do well. I just...\" You trail off, unsure how to make it sound better without turning it into obvious damage control.\n\n Jessica gives a small nod, glancing down at her desk again, tucking a strand of blonde hair behind her ear. \"Don't worry, I get it. You're just being honest.\" There's no bite in her voice, but her tone has cooled a little.\n\n The noise of homeroom fills the space between you. Somewhere near the front laughs loudly and a desk scrapes across the floor. Jessica just sit there, absently spinning her pen again, her focus somewhere else.\n\n You want to say something that would pull her out of the quiet drop in mood, but the right words don't really come.\n \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

I'm on the field again today.\"\n\n \"Let's gooo!\" he cheers, lifting both fists like he's the cheerleader you're the wide receiver. \"That means I get to watch you do those crazy flips again.\"\n\n \"I didn't do any flips,\" you deadpan.\n\n \"Yet,\" Samantha chimes in. \"Give it another week and we'll see you doing handsprings down the fifty-yard line.\"\n\n Luke gasps. \"You could though. You're bendy.\"\n\n \"I am not bendy,\" you say.\n\n \"Could've fooled me,\" Samantha jokes. \"You looked pretty nimble at the last game.\"\n\n \"Anyway, I'm hyped,\" Luke says, cheeks puffed out with food. He swallows, thumps his chest like a caveman, and grins. \"You're gonna cheer, I'm gonna get touchdowns, and then we win the whole thing. That's the dream.\"\n\n \"You say that every game,\" Samantha says flatly.\n\n Luke frowns. \"Well, this time it's true. The other team's quarterback sucks. I watched his highlight reel. Dude throws like a grandpa.\"\n\n \"You watched tape?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n \"Coach told us to,\" Luke says, shrugging. \"I got bored after ten minutes, but I saw enough. We're good.\"\n\n Samantha rolls her eyes and takes a sip of water. \"You football players and your delusions.\"\n\n Luke ignores her and turns to you again. \"Hey, so like, are you wearing the same uniform from last time? Or do you get new ones?\"\n\n \"Same one,\" you reply. \"It's only one per person unless something rips.\"\n\n Samantha smirks. \"Aw, Puke. What, wanna see the Asian girl again?\"\n\n Luke immediately chokes on his food. \"What? No! I just meant the uniform, like, if it's different colors or something?!\"\n\n You and Samantha both laugh.\n\n \"I'm just saying that you were pretty invested in her last time,\" Samantha adds with faux innocence. \"All starry-eyed and stuff.\"\n\n \"I didn't know it was [name], okay!?\" Luke insists, red-faced. \"And he looked completely different!\"\n\n \"I was wearing a uniform, not a mask,\" you say, smirking. \"You could've put it together.\"\n\n <<if [d12makeup] > 0>> \n Luke points an accusing finger. \"You had makeup on! That's cheating!\"\n \n \n Luke points an accusing finger. \"You had a skirt on! That's cheating!\"\n \n \n Luke points an accusing finger. \"You had those really short shorts on! That's cheating!\"\n \n\n You snort into your water bottle as Samantha covers her mouth, stifling a giggle.\n\n \"Y'all are so mean to me,\" Luke mumbles, sulking. \"My feelings are hurt.\"\n\n You lean back in your chair. It's comforting, in a weird way. Even with everything changing, this is still the same table, the same friends, the same dumb jokes. And somehow, they make everything feel okay.\n\n You glance down at your tray, then back up at them with a small smile.\n\n [Choice: Luke, do you want lip gloss?

Luke's devouring what looks like an aggressively overstuffed sandwich, while Samantha lazily stabs at her rice and chicken with a plastic spork.\n\n \"You ready for the game tonight?\" Samantha asks, looking up at Luke with one eyebrow cocked.\n\n \"Ready?\" Luke says, cheeks puffed out with food. He swallows, thumps his chest like a caveman, and grins. \"We're definitely gonna win.\"\n\n Samantha's expression doesn't budge. \"Uh-huh. You said that about every game last year. You went 8-2. Which isn't bad, but isn't 10-0.\"\n\n \"You have no faith, Samantha,\" Luke states. \"You gotta believe. Manifest it. Visualize the W for the Pacific Crest Panthers.\"\n\n \"Yeah, well, I visualized you tripping on your own shoelaces during warmups,\" she says dryly. \"So far, that's the only vision that's come true.\"\n\n You snort. \"She's got a point.\"\n\n \"You too, [name]?\" Luke asks, gasping. \"I thought you'd at least believe in me.\"\n\n \"I'm just saying, maybe don't act like you've already won before the game starts.\"\n\n He leans back in his chair, arms spread out confidently. \"Hey, the vibes are different this time. I can feel it in my hamstrings.\"\n\n \"If your hamstrings had predictive power, you'd be past Algebra by now,\" Samantha mutters dryly.\n\n Luke grins and points at her like she's proven his point. \"See? Banter like this? That's why I know tonight's gonna be legendary.\"\n\n You shake your head, smiling to yourself.\n\n \"Oh, by the way,\" Samantha says, tilting her head toward you. \"Where were you during the last game?\"\n\n You blink. \"What?\"\n\n Luke nods immediately, mouth full. \"Yeah, Sam was going on and on about how you just vanished.\" He swallows dramatically. \"She was like, 'Where's [name]? He was supposed to sit next to me!\"\n\n \"I did not say it like that,\" Samantha mutters, but she doesn't deny it.\n\n You scratch the back of your neck, trying to keep your face neutral. \"I, uh... I had stuff to do.\"\n\n Luke leans in. \"What kind of stuff?\"\n\n You shrug, eyes flicking down to your tray. \"Just... stuff.\"\n\n \"Well, that's not suspicious at all,\" Samantha says flatly, eyeing you over the rim of her water bottle. \"What kind of stuff takes priority over watching your best friend dramatically fail on the field?\"\n\n Luke jumps in with a grin. \"I made the game-winning touchdown, thank you very much.\"\n\n \"You tripped into the end zone,\" Samantha deadpans. \"It was less of a touchdown and more of a gravity-assisted stumble.\"\n\n \"I think you're misremembering things,\" Luke mumbles.\n\n Samantha rolls her eyes before glancing back at you. \"Anyway. Seriously, where'd you disappear to?\"\n\n You open your mouth to say something, but before you can come up with a decent deflection, Luke speaks again.\n\n \"Did you see that new cheerleader, though?\" he says. \"[temp] black hair. Pretty sure she was Asian. Kinda looked like—\" He pauses, then shrugs. \"I mean, not like you, but, like... sorta like you. From far away.\"\n\n Samantha hums thoughtfully. \"Yeah, I saw her. She's new, right? Must've just joined. She was good, though. Had the timing down and everything.\"\n\n Luke nods enthusiastically. \"And she was pretty. Not in, like, a weird way! Just objectively. I'd give her, like, a solid [temp1] out of 10.\"\n\n Samantha raises an eyebrow. \"What's the scale here?\"\n\n \"Don't worry about it,\" Luke says, waving her off.\n\n You stay quiet, watching the two of them go back and forth while trying not to squirm in your seat. The weird tight feeling in your chest returns. They're talking about you, and they have no idea.\n\n Not yet.\n\n [Choice: That girl's actually me]\n [Choice: That girl did pretty well, huh?]\n \n\n \n The lunchroom buzzes with the usual mid-day chaos. Your tray clatters down across from Luke and Samantha, both already halfway through their lunches. Luke's devouring what looks like an aggressively overstuffed sandwich, while Samantha lazily stabs at her rice and chicken with a plastic spork.\n\n \"Alright, everyone!\" Luke declares after swallowing. \"Today's the day. Redemption. Glory. Victory.\"\n\n \"Didn't you say you were going to win last week?\" Samantha asks, giving him a flat look.\n\n Luke frowns. \"Yeah, and?\"\n\n \"A Riverview defender knocked it out of your hands and we lost.\"\n\n Luke glares at her. \"That was a warm-up game. Doesn't count.\"\n\n You swallow your bite. \"Pretty sure the school's record would disagree.\"\n\n \"You two have no faith,\" Luke says. \"I'm telling you that we're gonna win today. I can feel it. I'm gonna make Pacific Crest proud.\"\n\n \"Mhm,\" you say, nodding slowly. \"Sure.\"\n\n \"Don't patriotize me, [name].\"\n\n \"Patronize you? Who's patronizing?\" Samantha says with mock innocence. \"I'm just pointing out that the team is already off to a 0-1 record. Statistically, not promising.\"\n\n Luke throws his hands up. \"You guys are the worst support squad ever.\"\n\n \"We're not the cheerleaders, you know,\" you point out.\n\n \"Exactly,\" Samantha smirks. \"We have no obligation to lie to you.\"\n\n Luke gasps. \"I can't believe you'd say that to me. Me! Your best friend.\"\n\n \"My best friend wouldn't fumble the ball,\" you mutters into your drink.\n\n Luke just flops into his seat and sighs. \"You're both gonna eat those words when I catch the game-winning pass. Mark my words.\"\n\n \"I'll mark them in invisible ink,\" Samantha says dryly.\n\n Luke frowns before suddenly getting a burst of energy. \"Oh!\" he exclaims. \"Hey, are you coming to the homecoming party on Saturday?\"\n\n You blink. \"The one after the game?\"\n\n \"Yeah!\" he says, nodding. \"It's gonna be huge. Decorations, snack, music, dancing. You gotta come, dude.\"\n\n [Choice: I'll go]\n [Choice: I don't really want to]",

Students flood the halls immediately. Some are rushing home, but most are getting ready to head to the homecoming game. You tighten the strap on your backpack, take one last breath of the classroom air, and start making your way toward the gym.\n\nYour footsteps echo against the polished floor as you navigate the crowd. There's a subtle shift in the atmosphere, a certain weight that comes with these big events. You pass clusters of students decked out in the school colors, black and cyan, while others bring signs out of their lockers. Some are even gossiping about who's going to be crowned king and queen tomorrow. Everyone's buzzing.\n\nBut you've got a different priority.\n\nBy the time you reach the back room door, most of the stragglers have peeled off. You push it open with a soft creak, and the familiar scent of wood and gym mats hits you instantly. There, standing around, are the girls. Your girls. Your squad.\n\nJessica's pacing a little, arms crossed, her brows furrowed with the kind of tension only she can carry. She glances up the second she hears you.\n\n\"Oh, thank God,\" she says, letting out a breath. \"You're here.\"\n\nMia is the first to speak after her, playing with her hair with that ever-present smug grin. \"Cutting it a little close, aren't we? What, did you forget where to meet?\"\n\nAshley, standing beside her with a calm expression and arms folded neatly, gives you a nod. \"We were starting to think you'd change your mind.\"\n\n\"I was, like, two minutes late,\" you say, dropping your bag and exhaling.\n\n\"You're not late,\" Jessica cuts in, shaking her head. \"You're just the last piece of the puzzle. Which means now we can actually start.\"\n\nTori spins around with a little flourish, her uniform with a few personalized patches that you think is against school policy. \"And not a moment too soon! I already had a vision of us forgetting the Macarena in front of the whole school. It was scary.\"\n\nJessica ignores that. \"Okay, listen up. This is the homecoming game. There's going to be parents, teachers, alumni, cameras, phones, and a LOT more. We need to be clean, sharp, and together. No missteps.\"\n\nHer eyes land on you again.\n\n\"I need you to be solid tonight, [name]. You were amazing last time, but this one really matters.\"\n\nYou nod. \"Got it.\"\n\nJessica nods back, seemingly reassured. \"Alright. Locker rooms. Get changed. Hair, check. Stretch, hydrate. Then we're gonna run through the whole thing.\"\n\nAs the others start grabbing their water bottles and stretching, you make your way toward the restroom. But before you can disappear behind the door, Jessica calls out to you again.\n\n\"Oh, makeup,\" she says, lifting a small clear pouch of supplies. \"We've got time for the basics. Or you can go with none. Up to you.\"\n\nYou pause with your hand on the door, considering.\n\n[Choice: Decide on makeup]\n[Choice: Decide on no makeup]",

Their bodies are slumped, their plays run slower, and their passes wobble. Meanwhile, the Pacific Crest Panthers are still riding the high of that massive halftime lead, coasting on adrenaline and confidence. The scoreboard tells the story in glaring numbers: 42-16.\n\nEven the crowds have shifted in energy. The home crowd is loud and excited, the nervous edge that was there earlier completely gone. Parents cheer with wide grins, a couple of kids near the back row have started a conga line, and someone's tossing glow sticks into the stands. The away crowd, on the other hand, have already started heading out.\n\nFrom your place near the sideline, the cheer squad's pom-poms rustle softly at your sides as you take it all in. Jessica's practically bouncing in place beside you. \"This is it,\" she whispers, her voice almost disbelieving. \"We're actually gonna do it.\"\n\nThe clock winds down to less than a minute, and Pacific Crest doesn't even bother pushing. They kneel with the ball, running down the clock steadily as the crowd counts it down out loud. Even the announcer's voice has gone relaxed.\n\n\"And with that final kneel, folks, we are just seconds away from an undeniable win for the Pacific Crest Panthers. What a show tonight, both on the field and from the cheer squad. Thank you all for coming out! This has been a night to remember.\"\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nBUZZ\n\nThe place erupts. Airhorns, clapping, screams, whistles. The marching band bursts into a triumphant fanfare as everyone leaps to their feet. The bleachers literally shake under the weight of all the jumping and cheering.\n\n\"And that's it! Final Score, 42-16! Pacific Crest takes the win for their 2024 Homecoming Game!\"\n\nConfetti starts falling. Black and blue streamers catch the field lights as they drift downward like little sparks. You don't know where it came from, but you're not questioning it.\n\n\"Let's go!\" Jessica shouts, practically dragging the rest of the squad forward as players begin forming up.\n\nYou all race toward the middle of the field, where the squad has started lining up, shoulder to shoulder. It's time for the victory tunnel.\n\nThe cheerleaders from a tunnel with their arms. The football players line up in the center, helmets off now, sweaty and grinning. Some of the guys crouch down, slapping hands and screaming encouragement to each other.\n\nYou're between Tori and Ashley, both of them breathless yet still buzzing with energy. Tori nudges you with her elbow. \"We crushed it,\" she says, still glowing.\n\nJessica steps into place at the head of the line, lifts her arms, and calls it:\n\n\"Let's welcome our Panthers!\"\n\nThe whole team begins streaming through the tunnel. Players sprint, laugh, and howl with the high of the wind. The cheer squad whoops and cheers every time someone passes through. You feel a pulse of pride, a certain joy of being part of something.\n\nUnder the lights, in the electric night, you smile wide without even thinking. Tonight feels like it's yours.\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

The lights blaze overhead, throwing long shadows across the celebration as football players wrap up high-fives, chest bumps, and group photos.\n\nThe squad clusters up near the sidelines as you all catch your breath, exchange smiles, and bask in the afterglow of the performance. You barely have time to drink some water before Luke barrels over, sweaty and ecstatic, his helmet tucked under his arm.\n\n\"Let's gooo!\" he yells, throwing his helmet off into the distance. \"We destroyed them! We obliterated them! This is historic.\"\n\nYou laugh.\n\n\"And we're not even done! You know what this calls for?\" Luke's eyes are practically glowing. \"After party!\"\n\nA few other players echo the call.\n\n\"After party!\"\n\n\"Where we going?\"\n\n\"Fuck yes.\"\n\nJessica, retying her ponytail, turns toward him. \"There's already a party tomorrow night. You know, the actual homecoming one?\"\n\n\"Yeah, duh, but that's tomorrow,\" Luke says, like it's the most obvious thing in the world. \"You gotta celebrate the win on the day of the win. It's science.\"\n\nTori pipes up from beside you, twirling a strand of her blue hair. \"He's not wrong. Tonight's got the vibes.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Luke says, clapping Tori on the back. \"Tori gets it. And besides, tomorrow will be all suits and slow dances. Tonight is for yelling and fries.\"\n\nJessica glances at Mia, who just shrugs in that smug way of hers, like she's not opposed but isn't going to suggest anything either.\n\nAshley crosses her arms. \"Where would we even go?\"\n\nThere's a brief pause as everyone looks at each other, clearly not having thought that far ahead.\n\n\"Not my house,\" someone mutters.\n\n\"Too loud for my place,\" another adds.\n\nLuke snaps his fingers. \"How about the bowling alley?\"\n\n\"Ooh!\" Tori exclaims, perking up. \"Velocity Lanes?\"\n\nAshley raises a brow. \"It's like ten minutes away.\"\n\n\"It's the best,\" Luke insists. \"They've got snacks, light, music, and even a slushie machine. It doesn't work half the time, but it's there.\"\n\nJessica hesitates. \"I don't know...\"\n\n\"Oh, come on,\" Luke groans. \"Jessica, we earned this. One chill night with greasy food and horrible music. What's the worst that could happen?\"\n\nAs the cheer squad exchanges glances, nods start to form. Tori's already texting someone. Mia doesn't say anything, but she's smirking, which probably means she's in.\n\nThen, a voice from the edge: \"I'll probably just head home.\"\n\nYou all turn to see Jordan, arms crossed, backpack already slung over one shoulder. He's clearly showered and changed while the rest of you were still out celebrating. His voice is quiet, but firm, like he's already made up his mind.\n\n\"Wait, what?\" Luke frowns. \"Bro, no. You're the team captain! You have to come.\"\n\n\"You threw three touchdown passes,\" Jessica says, joining in. \"You can't leave now.\"\n\n\"I'm tired,\" Jordan says. \"And I've got stuff to do.\"\n\nLuke looks offended. \"You can do stuff tomorrow. Tonight is for victory pizza.\"\n\n\"I don't even like bowling,\" Jordan mutters.\n\nTori gasps like he's just confessed to kicking puppies. \"Blasphemy.\"\n\nYou step forward with a grin. \"Come on. Everyone was hyping you up twenty minutes ago. That kind of thing demands hot dogs and bad music.\"\n\nJordan hesitates, his eyes flicking across the group. Everyone's waiting on him now. Even Mia's looking at him expectantly, arms folded.\n\nFinally he lets out a sigh. \"...Fine.\"\n\n\"Woo!\" Luke pumps a fist. \"Let's gooo! Bowling squad unite!\"\n\n\"I'll win,\" Mia says, smirking.\n\nTori gins. \"Oh, it's so on.\"\n\nThe decision is made. Bags are slung over shoulders, text messages start flying, and a few people start yelling out ride arrangements. As the group begins to shuffle toward the parking lot, still riding the post-win high, you walk with the rest of your squad.\n\nMaybe tonight's not quite over after all.\n\n[Choice: Bowling!]",

You can't see what's happening, but you can feel it. Her fingertips gently brushing across your cheekbone, the soft tap of a sponge, and the hush of a brush.

That's, like, the game, you know? People remember what happens tonight. They talk about it. Post about it. It's not just students. It's everyone. Parents, alumni, board members, faculty... and if we mess up, they're not gonna forget it.\"\n\n She dabs something near your temple, then smooths it out with a careful touch.\n\n \"I keep thinking about how if the team starts losing, the energy's gonna tank. Everyone's gonna look to us to make it okay, to hype things back up. And if we're off?\" She exhales sharply. \"Then it's over. The whole thing feels like it's on us.\"\n\n You open your mouth to respond, but she keeps going.\n\n \"And I know people think I'm supposed to be this... perfect leader or whatever. That I don't get nervous. That I'm confident. But sometimes I wake up on days like this and wonder who I really am. Am I really confident? Or have I just been faking it so well that everyone bought it.\"\n\n Her hands are still. You can feel the warmth of her breath as she lingers close, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\n \"I just... I really, really want tonight to go right. Not just for me. For the team. For everyone.\"\n\n You open your eyes slowly. Jessica's right in front of you, her expression unreadable, her hand still hovering near your face. Her usual perfect smile is nowhere to be seen.\n\n She lets out a quiet laugh, brushing some power off your cheek with her thumb. \"Wow. Sorry. That kind of spilled out.\"\n\n You shake your head. \"No, it's okay. I get it.\"\n\n She steps back, slipping the sponge into the pouch and zipping it shut.\n\n \"Alright,\" she says, trying to recover her usual poise. \"You're good to go. Subtle, clean, cute. The [name] special.\"\n\n But you can't miss that there's a hint of vulnerability still hanging in the air between you.\n\n [Choice: Hey. You've got this]\n [Choice: To me, you're already perfect]\n\n \n You give the makeup options a glance and decide, nah. Not today.\n\n \"No makeup,\" you say. \"I'm good like this.\"\n\n Jessica studies your face for a second, tilting her head just slightly like she's imagining you with eyeliner. But then she just nods, seemingly satisfied.\n\n \"Alright then,\" she says, voice brisk but warm. \"Go get ready.\"\n\n But before you can even take a full step, her voice cuts in.\n\n \"...Thanks, by the way. I really appreciate what you're doing, [name].\"\n\n You glance back at her. She's not smiling wide or anything, but the gratitude's there. In her voice and in her eyes.\n\n You smile just a little. \"Of course.\"\n\n And with that, you head into the restroom to change, the hum of the gym behind you, and the pressure of the night slowly building.\n\n Homecoming is waiting.\n\n [Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "<<if [transgender] > 14 and [acceptance] > 19>> \n \n You sit still for a beat, the warmth of Jessica's hand just fading from your skin, the smell of powder lingering faintly in the air between you. She's turned away slightly now, fixing her ponytail. You know you should just thank her and head out to change. You know that. But something about the moment holds you there.\n\n So you say it.\n\n \"To me, you're already perfect.\"\n\n The words come out smooth, but your heart stumbles a little. You feel the air shift. Jessica's hand pauses mid-motion. Slowly, she turns to look at you. Her expression, surprisingly, softens.\n\n \"You...\" she starts. Her eyes search your face, then linger—on your lips, your cheeks, the slight shimmer of the makeup she just put on you. A small smile plays on her lips. \"You're dangerous, you know that?\"\n\n \"Dangerous?\" you ask, breath catching.\n\n She shrugs a little. \"Saying stuff like that. Looking at me like that.\" She pauses, just long enough to feel the weight of her gaze. \"You make it really hard not to like you.\"\n\n You feel your ears go hot. It's not a confession, sure, but it's not nothing either.\n\n The moment holds, delicate and warm and just a little electric.\n\n Then she breaks it with a breathy laugh, brushing her fingers down your sleeve. \"Go change before I start thinking you did that on purpose.\"\n\n You smile, cheeks aching in the best way.\n\n \"Alright, alright. I'll be back in five.\"\n\n You grab your backpack and head toward the restroom, still feeling the ghost of her fingers on your face. The gym door swings shut behind you, and you let out a breath you didn't realize you were holding.\n\n Your heart's still thudding, but it's not nerves this time.\n\n Not really.\n \n \n \n \n Your heart jumps ahead of your brain.\n\n You tilt your head, offering a soft smile, voice low and sure.\n\n \"To me, you're already perfect,\" you say.\n\n The words come out smoother than expected, but the moment after it is rougher than you're ready for.\n\n Jessica stiffens almost instantly. \"Oh,\" Jessica says, letting out a breathy chuckle. \"That's... sweet.\"\n\n You can feel the air turn awkward.\n\n Jessica grabs a small mirror from her bag, holding it out to you without looking. \"Here. You can check your makeup if you want.\"\n\n You take it quietly, eyes dropping. The blush looks fine. Everything does.\n\n Jessica turns away, smoothing her ponytail with a quick, practiced flick. \"You should probably get going. Still need to run the routine a couple more times.\"\n\n You nod, standing up without a word. The bag slung over your shoulder feels heavier, somehow.\n\n \"I'll go change,\" you say simply, voice neutral.\n\n Jessica doesn't respond right away. She just gives a small nod, barely glancing over her shoulder.\n\n You step out of the room, the door closing softly behind you, your footsteps echoing down the hallway as you head for the restroom.\n \n\n \n \n \"Hey,\" you say. \"You've got this.\"\n\n Your voice is calm and steady. Not loud or dramatic. Just... enough. Your eyes meet, and you let the words settle in the air between you, simple and honest.\n\n Jessica blinks, caught off guard for a second. Then, slowly, her posture eases. Her shoulders drop just slightly, the tension she didn't realize she was carrying slipping away.\n\n \"Thank you, [name],\" she says, earnestly. \"Seriously.\"\n\n You give her a smile, brushing your palms on your thighs before standing. \"And thanks for the makeup,\" you say, giving a little nod toward the pouch she's just tucked away. \"I know we've got a lot to do, so thanks for making time.\"\n\n Jessica waves a hand like it's nothing, but you can tell it meant something. \"It was the least I could do. You're part of the squad now.\"\n\n \"I appreciate that,\" you say, slinging your backpack over your shoulder. \"Guess I better go get changed, then.\"\n\n \"Go on,\" she says, already pulling out a clipboard. \"We've got formations to clean up and stunts to tighten, so don't disappear on me.\"\n\n You shoot her a small salute as you turn and head off toward the locker room.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Jessica spots you and gives a relieved exhale. \"Good,\" she says, flicking through her clipboard as the others gather. \"We've got a lot to go over.\"\n\nYou can tell that her cheer captain mode is fully engaged now.\n\nMia twirls a strand of hair around her finger, smirking slightly. \"Let me guess. Drills first?\"\n\n\"Routine first,\" Jessica corrects, already moving to the center of the gym floor. \"We're going from the top. Remember: tonight is homecoming. We do not mess this up.\"\n\nAshley nods with a quiet focus. \"Are the formations clean?\"\n\n\"Mostly,\" Jessica replies. \"Tori, I noticed that you were a half-step behind in the second transition. [name], you and Mia swap when we move into the V.\"\n\nTori hums, bouncing lightly on her toes. \"Got it! Half-step behind.\"\n\nYou move into place, feeling the rush of adrenaline as you get ready.\n\nThe routine starts.\n\nThe first run-through is mostly smooth. There are some footwork slips, some timing hiccups, and Mia throwing in a hair flip that Jessica does not approve of. But overall, it holds together. You hit your marks, your muscle memory keeping you on track. Some confidence creeps back in by the time you land your final pose.\n\nJessica claps once. \"Again. Sharper this time.\"\n\nThe second and third run go even smoother. You lose track of time, of how many times you hear the same chorus, of how many times Jessica repeats \"energy!\"\n\nEventually, she lets out a breath and steps back. \"Alright. Break time. Five minutes.\"\n\nYou collapse onto the bleachers and wipe your forehead with the back of your arm. The rest of the squad fans out around the gym, drinking water or chatting. Still, there's ten minutes you can spend focusing on something before the performance.\n\n[Choice: Focus on squad bond]\n[Choice: Focus on your presence]\n[Choice: Focus on your precision]\n[Choice: Focus on your stamina]",

      "text": "You make your way toward Mia, Tori, and Ashley. \"So,\" you say as you flop down next to them, \"what do cheerleaders even talk about when we're not flipping through the air?\"\n\n Tori raises one hand dramatically like she's about to make a declaration. \"Conspiracy theories,\" she says. \"Specifically: birds. Not real.\"\n\n \"You're still on that?\" Ashley asks, blinking.\n\n \"Still right,\" Tori insists, waggling a finger. \"The government—\"\n\n \"Has better things to than spy on you with pigeons,\" Mia cuts in with a sigh, examining her nails. \"You say this every week, and I'm still waiting for a single piece of real evidence.\"\n\n \"I have a PowerPoint,\" Tori says.\n\n You grin. \"Of course you do.\"\n\n Ashley arches a brow, leaning back slightly against the bleachers. \"To be fair, even I've got to admit her PowerPoint game is solid. Last month it was about how vending machines are actually time portals.\"\n\n \"Okay, that one was more theoretical,\" Tori concedes. \"I'm still testing it on my own. I've tried to get Aurora on board, but she keeps being all spooky. I have a whole system.\"\n\n \"Your 'system' is punching random combinations of numbers,\" Mia mutters.\n\n \"That's science, though.\"\n\n You chuckle, genuinely enjoying the absurdity of the conversation. \"Wait, what's the weirdest snack you've actually gotten from a vending machine?\"\n\n \"Oh! Oh!\" Tori sits upright. \"When I visited Japan, I did the test on the vending machine there. I just ended up getting a bag of pickled octopus, though.\"\n\n Ashley looks mildly impressed. \"That's kind of badass.\"\n\n \"It was terrible, I threw up,\" Tori adds brightly. \"But badass, yeah.\"\n\n \"I got a single unwrapped peppermint once,\" Mia says dryly. \"I was deeply offended. I just threw it away.\"\n\n \"Was it glowing?\" you ask.\n\n \"No, but it felt cursed,\" she replies, deadpan.\n\n You glance over at Ashley. \"Please tell me you've had a vending machine horror story too.\"\n\n Ashley tilts her head, considering your words. \"One time, I hit B4, but it gave me B5. That's about as wild as I get.\"\n\n \"Chaos,\" Tori mutters.\n\n You lean back on your hands, grinning. \"I think I'm starting to like these breaks more than the routines.\"\n\n \"Don't get used to it,\" Mia teases. \"Jessica won't let us off easily.\"\n\n As if summoned, Jessica's voice calls out from across the gym: \"Alright, squad! Break's over! Let's go.\"\n\n You stand, dusting your hands off, and glance around at your teammates.\n\n Yeah. You're definitely not an outsider anymore.\n\n \n \n You don't head for water. Not yet. Instead, you move back toward the center of the gym's basketball court. You plant yourself there, alone for a moment, and start walking through the routine again. You do just enough to think about your presence. Jessica always says your motions need to go past your limbs. That the crowd doesn't just see your jumps or your formations—they see your face. The way you carry it all. The story you're telling in your smile.\n\n So, you try.\n\n You throw a clean combo, forcing a grin.\n\n But when you glance toward a mirror, you flinch. You don't look enthusiastic. You just look exhausted. Like someone trying way too hard to look like they're having fun.\n\n You try again. Your arms land in the right place, and your hair bounces with it, but your smile looks pained. It's as if you're grimacing. Like you're a few seconds away from losing breath, which is honestly not far from the truth.\n\n A small voice perks up from your side. \"You look like that meme with that old guy smiling, but he actually looks like he's in agony. Hide the Pain Harold.\"\n\n You turn to see Tori.\n\n You laugh once. \"I'm trying, okay?\"\n\n She props her chin up with one hand and lifts an eyebrow. \"Trying's not the issue. You're just trying wrong. You don't force your face to smile. It's not like a button you push. You gotta think about something fun. Something good. You feel it first, then let your face catch up.\"\n\n You blink. \"So... what am I meant to think about? Bunnies?\"\n\n \"If bunnies work, sure,\" she says, shrugging. \"What I imagine is that I'm a pop star and every single person in the crowd is secretly in love with me. Works like a charm.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Seriously?\"\n\n Tori shoots you finger guns. \"Dead serious. Try it.\"\n\n You sigh, but reset. This time, you picture something different. Not just hitting the move right, but owning the space. Letting the roar of the crowd swell in your mind. You imagine them reacting to you, not just foe formation. A tiny spark lights in your chest.\n\n And when you smile this time, it feels less fake. Still practiced, yeah, but it comes easier.\n\n Tori claps once, delighted. \"There it is! I knew you had it in you, [name].\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" you say. \"Seriously.\"\n\n \"No problem!\" she says, already skipping backward. \"Just don't forget me when you're famous.\"\n\n You barely have time to laugh before Jessica's voice cuts across the gym. \"Alright! Break's over! Let's go!\"\n\n You jog back with the others, your movements just a little looser now.\n\n \n \n Everyone else is scattered, but your mind's stuck on that third sequence. Your arms lagged a beat during the ripple and you almost stumbled during the transition. You were close, but that isn't good enough. Especially not today.\n\n You push yourself off the bleachers and run the motions again, slower this time. One, two, three, arm sweep, twist, kick, four, five, six.\n\n You try again and again, but you can't quite get it right.\n\n \"You're half a count early on the downbeat,\" a calm voice says nearby. \"It's throwing off your finish.\"\n\n You turn your head and see Ashley walking over. \"You keep rushing after the wrist,\" she adds. \"You need to breathe right before the kick. Here, lemme show you.\"\n\n She steps in next to you and moves through the sequence. It's clear she's done it hundreds of times already. Every movement is sharp, clean, and unhurried. You try again beside her, mirroring the rhythm, and this time it flows better. She nods once, approving. \"That's better. Let's do it again.\"\n\n The two of you run it through a few more times. You fall into her tempo, and the routine begins to feel smoother. Less jagged around the edges.\n\n \"Thanks,\" you say, pausing between reps. \"Seriously. I've been trying to get that timing right since... I don't even know.\"\n\n Ashley shrugs lightly. \"That's what the squad is for. You're getting there.\"\n\n \"Glad I've got you around to keep me from face-planting in front of half the school,\" you say, giving her a smile.\n\n \"Oh, if you're still face-planting by game time, we've got bigger problems,\" she says with just the faintest glimmer of amusement in her voice.\n\n Before you can respond, Jessica's voice cuts across the gym. \"Alright! Break's over! Back on the floor!\"\n\n Ashley gives you one last nod and turns, jogging back to join the group. You take a second, bounce on your toes, and shake out your arms.\n\n You're feeling more grounded now. You've improved. The rhythm is there.\n\n You jog back into formation, ready for more.\n\n \n \n You rise from the bleachers, taking a breath and stretching your arms above your head. You're not done yet. Not until you're sure you've got it in you to keep up for the entire game.\n\n You step onto the edge of the court and start to jog. Slow at first, then quicker. One lap. Two. Three. On your fifth lap, you pass Mia. She idly sips from a reusable water bottle while watching you with a smug little smirk.\n\n \"Dedicated much?\" she calls, following you.\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"It's homecoming. I'm the newbie. Gotta do well today.\"\n\n Mia tilts her head. \"You're not wrong,\" she says, twisting her water bottle shut. \"Still. Try not to pass out before the second quarter, yeah? Jessica won't be happy.\"\n\n \"No promises,\" you say.\n\n Another lap. Your legs are burning now, but in a good way. You imagine the field later. The crowd. The energy. The moment. You can't run out of gas then.\n\n \"Alright!\" Jessica's voice rings through the gym. \"Break's over, everyone back together!\"\n\n You pull to a stop, rolling your shoulders back and brushing your bangs from your face. Your skin hums with effort, but your mind feels clear.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

We're heading to the football field. Let's move.\"\n\nYou grab your water bottle and fall in with the others as the squad funnels through the door, the evening sun spilling in. Outside, the temperature has dipped just enough to tease the crisp edge of fall, the air filled with the sounds of pre-game setup. The stadium speakers are being tested, the band is practicing, and the concession stands are prepping food.\n\nJessica leads at a steady pace, clipboard tucked under her arm. She's definitely in captain mode now, fully focused. She keeps glancing at her phone, then toward the stadium. You can tell the weight of the night is starting to settle in.\n\nThe rest of the squad fans out as you reach the football field. From here, you can see the bleachers starting to populate with students and parents, the marching band turning up in the far corner, and players from both teams doing warm-ups under the floodlights. The game hasn't started yet, but the energy is definitely building.\n\nJessica pauses just before the path branches off into the three main entrances to the field. She turns toward you, Mia, Tori, and Ashley.\n\n\"Alright. We've got fans starting to come in from all three sides, and the Arts and Crafts Club dropped off spirit items. Noise clappers, necklaces, mini flags, bracelets, all of it. We need to split up and man each of the entrances. Just smile, hand stuff out, and hype people up. We want everyone walking in feeling like this is the game of the year.\"\n\nShe gestures toward the canvas bags piled beside the gate, filled with all sorts of bright blue-and-black merch. \"Take a few and make sure to engage people. We need our crowd alive tonight.\"\n\nMia rolls her eyes, already slinging one of the totes over her shoulder. \"Do I have to hype up freshmen? I'd rather hype up a brick wall.\"\n\n\"You'll live,\" Jessica replies flatly.\n\nAshley takes her bag wordlessly, adjusting the strap over one shoulder like she's about to head off on a solo mission.\n\nTori is already rifling through her bag with glee. \"They gave us glitter stickers again! Ooh, and the little foam fingers!\"\n\nJessica points to the three stadium entrances in the distance: one by the parking lot, one by the school, and the main gate. \"Pick one and hold it down until kickoff.\"\n\nThe girls start to move out, scattering across the grass.\n\nYou take a deep breath and glance at the three entrances.\n\n[Choice: The parking lot entrance]\n[Choice: The school entrance]\n[Choice: The main entrance]",

      "text": "The walk to the parking lot entrance is quieter than the other paths. Less chaos. More mellow. You pass a few early arrivals and make your way to Ashley. She has the tote bag slung over one shoulder like a fashion accessory.\n\n \"Hey,\" she says, cool as ever, giving you a nod as you approach. \"Thought you might pick this one.\"\n\n You grin, grabbing a handful of blue necklaces from the bag. \"What gave it away?\"\n\n \"You've got mellow energy,\" she says simply. \"Figured you wouldn't pick the entrance with freshmen doing TikTok dances.\"\n\n \"Fair.\"\n\n You both fall into a rhythm—passing out spirit gear, offering polite smiles and an occasional \"Go Panthers\" as families, alumni, and staff trickle through. Ashley doesn't talk much at first, but her quiet presence isn't awkward. If anything, it's a little grounding. She's not like Tori, who lights up the space. Ashley just sort of exists in a solid way.\n\n That is until a new presence approaches.\n\n Aurora.\n\n She walks up slowly, her shoes silent against the pavement, the breeze tugging ever so slightly at her skirt. Her necklace shimmers slightly, almost as if they've absorbed too much moonlight. Her eyes flick lazily to Ashley, then land on you.\n\n She doesn't say anything at first. Just looks.\n\n And then, the smallest smirk curls at the edge of her lips.\n\n \"Hmm.\"\n\n Just that. Hmm. Like she's already read everything about you and found it amusing.\n\n \"Hey,\" you say, shifting awkwardly.\n\n Aurora tilts her head. \"Interesting.\"\n\n Ashley tenses beside you.\n\n Aurora's gaze lingers on you for another beat before she adds, voice soft and vaguely amused, \"You wear it well.\" Then, just like that, she turns on her heel and glides away, vanishing into the stands.\n\n You blink. \"What was that about?\"\n\n Ashley exhales slowly, and when you glance over, you realize her composure has cracked just a bit. Her brows are furrowed and there's a crease of unease between them.\n\n \"Okay,\" she mutters. \"I hate when she does that.\"\n\n You squint at her. \"You're freaked out? That's new.\"\n\n \"She's the only person in this school that genuinely freaks me out,\" Ashley states, shaking her head. \"I don't think you get it, [name]. Aurora doesn't just pretend to know things. She really does know something that the rest of us don't.\"\n\n \"Oh, I know she knows,\" you say, glancing in the direction Aurora disappeared. \"She's not that scary.\"\n\n Ashley stares at you like you just said you wrestle bears for fun. \"She is that scary.\"\n\n You laugh softly. \"She's cryptic, yeah. But kind of cool.\"\n\n Ashley frowns again. \"That's how she gets you. You're lured in by the mysterious vibes and the next thing you know, you've been turned into a guinea pig.\"\n\n You grin, amused by the rare glimpse of an off-balance Ashley. \"Well, at least she didn't hex us.\"\n\n \"Don't joke about it,\" Ashley says, groaning. \"If I start levitating tonight, I'm blaming you.\"\n\n The two of you share a laugh, although hers is more nervous than she'd probably like to admit. And just like that, the tension breaks, fading back into the hum of the pre-game rush. Fans keep arriving, and the stack of spirit merch slowly dwindles. Still, Aurora's voice lingers in your mind.\n\n \"You wear it well.\"\n\n You're not sure if she knows or not, but you have a feeling you'll find out.\n\n \n The school's entrance is bustling. You make your way over to the front, where Mia is already stationed. She's watching the incoming crowd with a smug little smirk.\n\n \"You're late,\" Mia says as you approach.\n\n You check your phone. \"I literally got here a minute after you did.\"\n\n She shrugs, handing a foam finger to a student. \"Exactly. That's a minute late.\"\n\n You roll your eyes and get beside her. \"What'd I miss?\"\n\n \"Well, a freshman tried to flirt with me by asking how I did my hair.\" Mia stretches her arms overhead and yawns dramatically. \"The highlight of my day.\"\n \n \"Riveting,\" you deadpan, fishing out a few piece of merch.\n\n The two of you settle into a casual rhythm, trading comments between passerby and offering up cheer gear. Mia mostly critiques people's outfits under her breath or ranks them by potential school spirit. You keep it lowkey, offering polite smiles.\n\n And then Vincent appears.\n\n He's walking up slowly from the squad, his sleeves pulled awkwardly over his hands. His eyes flick nervously from person to person, like he's calculating escape routes. He's carrying a small sketchbook tucked under one arm and fidgeting with the edge of it like he doesn't know whether he even should've come.\n\n You perk up. \"Hey, Vincent.\"\n\n His head snaps toward you like you've just caught him committing a crime. He slows to a stop in front of you and blinks, clearly not recognizing you.\n\n \"Want some spirit gear?\" you offer, holding out a glittery \"Go Panthers\" sticker sheet.\n\n Vincent's eyes flick to the items, then back to your face. His lips part like he's about to say something, but then he just sort of panics.\n\n \"Uh, th-thanks,\" he mumbles, grabbing the sheet a little too quickly and nearly dropping it. \"I, uh, gotta go...\"\n\n And he scurries off, nearly bumping into another person on the way.\n\n Mia watches him go, one eyebrow arched. \"Well that was tragic,\" she says dryly.\n\n \"He's just shy,\" you respond.\n\n \"Mhm,\" Mia nods. \"I'm just surprised he's here. Like, I've seen him before—but only when he's eating lunch in the corner and drawing in his sketchbook.\"\n\n You blink. \"Wait, you know him?\"\n\n \"I guess?\" Mia shrugs. \"He's in my Calculus class. Never talks unless he's answering a question, and even then it sounds like he's afraid someone's gonna sock him for it.\"\n\n You glance over your shoulder, watching as Vincent looks around, desperately trying to find a place to sit.\n\n \"He's really not that bad once you talk to him,\" you say quietly.\n\n Mia hums. \"Maybe you're right. But he definitely looked like he saw a ghost just now. You sure you know him?\"\n\n \"Pretty sure,\" you say, smiling faintly. \"He just didn't recognize me.\"\n\n She nods, lets it drop, and hands a sticker to a kid in a graphic tee as he passes by.\n\n And just like that, the moment's gone. But your mind lingers on Vincent a little longer. The way he looked at you like he almost recognized something but couldn't quite name it. Like some invisible string tugged at him and he didn't know why.\n\n \n The sun's beginning to dip, casting long golden streaks across the front of Pacific Crest High. You make your way toward the main entrance, where Tori's already posted up.\n\n \"Hey!\" she chirps, waving dramatically with both arms. \"Over here, helper elf!\"\n\n You try not to laugh as you jog over. She's surrounded by a chaotic spread of spirit beads, flags, foam fingers, and what looks suspiciously like a glitter cannon.\n\n \"Did you bring the charm and charisma? 'Cause I brought the sparkle,\" Tori says.\n\n \"I brought... responsibility,\" you offer.\n\n \"Good enough,\" she sings, slapping a glitter sticker on your shoulder. \"You're now officially part of the Sparkle Corps.\"\n\n You settle in beside her as the two of you get to work, handing out stickers, greeting people, and trying to keep the foam fingers from flying away in the wind. Tori, naturally, does most of the talking. She asks people their favorite outfits, compliments outfits, and gives kids nickname on the spot (\"You, sir, are officially Captain Panther Spirit!\"). You decide to stay back and deal with the merchandise.\n\n It's going well, until you spot a familiar figure making her way up the steps.\n\n Samantha.\n\n She's in her usual outfit, but her eyes are sharp as they land on you.\n\n \n She stops just a few steps away, squints at you for a second, then smirks.\n\n \"Well I'll be damned,\" she says, crossing her arms. \"You actually pull it off.\"\n\n You lift your chin a little, schooling your face into a neutral smile. \"Can I do anything for you, miss?\" you say, pretending not to know her. \"Free foam finger? Sticker?\"\n\n Samantha raises an eyebrow. \"Yeah. You can stop showing me up.\"\n\n You can't help the grin that breaks through as she snorts and brushes a few strands of hair behind her ear.\n\n \"Seriously though, you look good,\" she says, glancing over your uniform. \"Like... suspiciously good. I hate it. Go away.\"\n\n She laughs before turning on her heel and strolling off lazily, like she didn't just make your whole afternoon.\n\n Tori, who's been standing beside you the whole time holding a fistful of plastic beads, blinks twice. \"Sooo... I'm guessing she knows?\"\n\n \"Of course I told her,\" you say, shrugging casually. \"She's my best friend.\"\n\n Tori nods slowly. \"Yeah. Makes sense.\"\n\n You go back to handing out merch, a little lighter on your feet than before.\n \n \n \"Uh oh,\" you mutter.\n\n Tori tilts her head. \"Friend of yours?\"\n\n \"To say the least, yeah,\" you say quickly. \"She's my best friend.\"\n\n Samantha slows as she approaches. She doesn't say anything at first, just looks at you. Really takes a proper look at you. Head tilted slightly and brows faintly drawn together like she's trying to line up two overlapping images in her brain.\n\n \"...Hey,\" she says slowly.\n\n \"Hey,\" you reply, keeping your voice quiet. You hand a pin to a student without breaking eye contact.\n\n Samantha's eyes narrow a little. \"You look... familiar.\"\n\n You try to play dumb. \"I've got one of those faces.\"\n\n She glances at your shoulder, then at your outfit, and finally back up to your face again. A beat of silence stretches out. Her gaze sharpens.\n\n \"Never mind,\" she says suddenly, backing up a step. \"Weird.\"\n\n Then she just turns and walks off down the steps like nothing happened.\n\n You exhale slowly, trying not to let the tension show in your posture.\n\n Tori watches her go with a curious expression. \"Does she know?\"\n\n \"I don't know,\" you state. \"But if anyone could figure it out...\"\n\n \"...It'd be her,\" Tori finishes.\n\n \"Exactly,\" you mutter, handing out another sticker.\n\n Tori doesn't press further, opting to just give you a cheeky smile. \"Well, let's hope she doesn't tattle. You make the whole cheer squad vibe way better.\"\n \n \n\n[Choice: Kickoff]",

The bleachers are almost full as the homecoming game approaches kickoff. Music pumps from the speakers, and the scent of fresh popcorn and synthetic turf drifts through the cool breeze.\n\nYou weave through the crowd until you spot Jessica waving you over. You make your way to the sidelines, where the team has reassembled. Her clipboard is tucked under her arm and her brows are knit in intense focus.\n\n\"There you are,\" she says, relief flashing in her expression. \"Everyone's back now, good.\"\n\nYou nod and fall in beside the others. Mia's chewing gum like she owns the place, Tori's fidgeting with one of the streamer batons, and Ashley is stretching her arms above her head. There's a quiet unity to it now. You're all in uniform, standing shoulder to shoulder in the bright stadium lights.\n\n\"All right, team,\" Jessica says, voice tightening slightly. \"We've got twenty minutes until kickoff. We'll do our welcome cheer during the pregame runout, and then the halftime show. Everyone know their placements?\"\n\nEveryone murmurs that they've got it.\n\nJessica turns to you specifically, her voice softening just a touch. \"You good, [name]?\"\n\nYou nod. \"Yeah. Let's kill it.\"\n\nShe gives you a grateful smile before stepping forward. \"Okay, everyone! Let's line up. Time to welcome the team out.\"\n\nYou fall into position near Mia, the lines crisp as the squad marches onto the edge of the track, facing the tunnel that leads into the locker rooms. The football players are just beyond it, waiting for their cue. You can already hear the thuds of helmets and shoulder pads, the short chants they do to psych themselves up before charging onto the field.\n\nThe cheer team bursts into synchronized motion, voices rising with the practiced chant you've drilled so many times already.\n\n\"Let's fight, Panthers! Blue and white, we own the night!\"\n\nThe crowd cheers. You catch a blur of movement as the players come surging from the tunnel, led by Luke at full speed, the team's banner cracking in the wind. He waves to the stands, then to the cheer squad, his grin as wide and wild as ever.\n\nYou keep cheering, keeping in formation as the rest of the squad pivots and hits their marks. Jessica counts under her breath as the team snaps into the final pose of the routine. A wave of applause erupts. You're sweating already, but you can't help smiling.\n\nThe marching band snaps into formation. Trumpets gleam under the rising stadium lights. The band launches into a bold, brassy fight song. It's a little generic, sure, but catchy in the way school spirit songs always are. The student's section full now, the Pacific Crest side full of blue and black. Posters are being waved, foam fingers bob, and people cheer. The energy is electric.\n\n\"Good evening, Pacific Crest High!\"\n\nThe booming voice of the stadium announcer cuts through the music. The band tapers off and the crowd claps politely before falling to a hush.\n\n\"Welcome to the 2024 Homecoming Game! Tonight, your very own Pacific Crest Panthers will take on the visiting Sierra Heights Wolves in what promises to be an unforgettable matchup. We've got a packed house tonight, an exciting halftime performance, and plenty of school spirit. Let's make some noise!\"\n\nThe bleachers erupt in cheers, the applause roaring.\n\n\"Let's bring out our team captains for the coin toss!\"\n\nJordan walks forward with three other players, helmet under his arm and expression sharp with focus. The visiting team's captain approaches from the opposite end of the field, meeting at the fifty-yard line with the referee, who holds a silver coin in one hand.\n\nThe mic picks up the exchange as the ref holds up the coin. \"Heads is the school logo, tails is the state seal. Sierra Heights, you're the visiting team. Call it in the air.\"\n\nThe Wolves' captain, a tall, broad guy with a buzz-cut, nods and calls, \"Heads.\"\n\nThe coin goes into the air, arcing high under the field lights. It spins before landing flat in the grass.\n\n\"Looks like it's heads! Sierra Heights wins the toss. They've elected to receive.\"\n\nA low rumble passes through the stands. The crowd's hungry now. The cheer squad snaps to position near the sidelines as the teams line up for kickoff. You fall in beside Jessica, who tosses you a quick glance, then nods toward the field.\n\nThe stadium lights hum overhead, white and blinding as they flicker to full strength.\n\nThe kicker for the Wolves plants his cleats into the turf, the ball poised on the tee.\n\nA pause.\n\nA whistle.\n\nAnd then his leg swings forward in a smooth, practiced arc, sending the ball soaring into the air.\n\n[Choice: The game begins!]",

The offense has been tight, and the defense relentless. The scoreboard glows with the proof: Pacific Crest 28, Sierra Heights 7.\n\nThe final tackle hits like thunder, the crowd erupts, and the whistle signals halftime.\n\nThe moment the teams jog off the field, the band strikes up a peppy tune and the cheer squad immediately begins to assemble. Jessica claps her hands twice, rallying everyone. \"Alright! Let's go, let's go! Formation A!\"\n\nYou fall into line with the others. The cool night air brushes against your face as the first beats of the halftime routine echo across the stadium, the marching band matching your rhythm. The crowd begins to clap along.\n\nYou take your place in the formation, shoulders squared and chest lifted. All around you, the others are locking into place. Ashley's steady and poised, Mia has a confident grin, and Tori is bouncing on her shoes with bright neon laces. Jessica stands at the center, giving a subtle nod that shows she's confident.\n\nAnd then the music hits.\n\nThe routine bursts into motion. It's fast, it's clean, and it's alive. Every move lands with precision. The high kicks, synchronized claps, sharp turns, lifts and dips. All of them land effortlessly. The crowd oohs and cheers at the big pyramid formation mid-routine. Mia, the flyer, flips with effortless grace before being caught perfectly. You're breathing hard, but your body knows exactly what to do, falling into the rhythm like it's second nature.\n\nSomewhere around the middle, you catch sight of the stands. Students are on their feet. People are recording on their phones. Even the opposing side is watching with a kind of stunned curiosity.\n\nThere's a rush in your chest. It's not nerves or stage fright, it's just... joy. It bubbles up like lightning in your veins. You're an essential part of this. You belong to this moment. The sound of synchronized stomps, the glow of the lights, and the glitter of pom-poms in motion. The world narrows to the beat, the roar of the crowd, and the pounding of your heart.\n\nYou steal a glance at Jessica during one of the final sequences. Her face is flushed and her expression is focused, but there's a glint in her eye. She knows it's going well.\n\nThe final pose hits right on cue. Fists up, chests lifted, breath held. The music cuts.\n\nA beat of silence before explosion.\n\nThe crowd erupts. Cheers rain down like confetti. The band whoops behind you, and a few football players at the sidelines are literally jumping in place. The announcer's voice crackles back on over the speaker.\n\n\"Let's hear it for the Pacific Crest cheer squad! That was incredible!\"\n\nYou exhale and let yourself smile. You may be tired, but you don't even care.\n\nSomewhere behind you, Tori whispers, \"Holy crap. That was awesome.\"\n\nJessica calls out, \"Great work, everyone! Take a breather, hydrate, and meet back at the sideline.\"\n\nAs you jog back toward the benches with the rest of the squad, the band starting up again. The night hums around you. Everything feels almost dreamlike: the cheering fans, the upbeat music, and the stadium lights.\n\nYou're shining.\n\n[Choice: Shine bright like a diamond]",

Students flood the halls immediately. Some are rushing home, but most are getting ready to head to the homecoming game. You tighten the strap on your backpack, take one last breath of the classroom air, and start making your way toward the front of the school.\n\nYou find Samantha leaning casually against the wall near the school's front entrance, arms crossed, phone out, and a lollipop hanging out of her mouth like a cigarette. She looks like she's plotting something dangerous. Which, knowing her, she probably is.\n\n\"There you are,\" she says without looking up. \"Took you long enough.\"\n\nYou adjust the strap on your backpack. \"Sorry.\"\n\nSamantha rolls her eyes and shoves her phone into her hoodie pocket. \"Well, no time for apologies now. We've got bigger things to deal with.\"\n\n\"Such as?\"\n\nShe pushes off the wall, walking with purpose toward the flagpole. \"The Sierra Heights Wolves. You think they're just gonna roll over and let us win on our home turf?\"\n\nYou blink. \"I mean... we're not even on the team.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Which means we have no rules.\" She spins on her heel to face you, that glint in her eyes sharper than ever. \"[name], we are going to sabotage them.\"\n\nYou stare at her. \"Wait. What?\"\n\n\"Sabotage,\" she repeats, like it's the most obvious thing in the world. \"Not anything super bad, I'm not that evil. Just enough to rattle them and shake their alpha-wolf confidence. Let 'em know they're in Panther territory.\"\n\nYou hesitate. \"Samantha, we're just spectators—\"\n\n\"No, we're not,\" Samantha states, already pulling a folded piece of paper from her pocket. \"Let me correct you here. We, [name], are agents of chaos.\"\n\nYou sigh. \"Oh no.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she says, unfolding the page. \"Allow me to present your options.\"\n\nThe page is full of scribbles and arrows and what appears to be a hand-drawn wolf mascot with Xs for eyes.\n\n\"Operation One: Poster Pandemonium. We print out a bunch of dumb memes of their mascot. I've got one where it looks like he's getting kicked in the balls. We'll tape them all over the place where their bus will park. You know, classic stuff.\"\n\n\"That's... stupid,\" you say, grinning despite yourself.\n\n\"Stupid, sure, but it is effective,\" she shoots back. \"Now, Operation Two: Streamers of Betrayal. You know that tunnel everyone uses for their intro? The one with the lights and the smoke machines?\"\n\nYou nod slowly.\n\n\"Each team gets their own streamer setup. What I think we should do, is replace their streamers with Pacific Crest colors. Imagine them coming through and stepping into a storm of blue and black Panther colors.\"\n\n\"Samantha, that is so petty,\" you mutter.\n\nShe beams. \"Exactly.\"\n\nYou shake your head in disbelief. \"Is that it, or do you have another one?\"\n\n\"Operation Three: Locker Room Loyalty Crisis.\" She holds up three fingers. \"We sneak into the away locker room before they get there and plant a bunch of signs in their lockers that say things like 'Go Panthers!' or 'Sierra Heights = Chihuahuas.' It'll be emotionally devastating.\"\n\n\"Sounds terrifying to me,\" you mutter.\n\nYou glance around the courtyard. Students are breaking off in every direction. The Wolves won't arrive for a while longer. The tunnel is probably still being prepped. The locker room might even be unlocked. And you're right here, standing next to your best friend who may be too loyal to her school.\n\nSamantha steps in front of you, pressing the paper to your chest. \"So.

The low thump of distant music floats on the late afternoon air, mixing with the scent of cooking food. You and Samantha make your way toward the main entrance, blending in with the crowd of arriving spectators. Everyone hums with that particular kind of excitement that only Friday night football can bring.\n\n\"Okay, now that Operation Chaos is complete, we get to enjoy the show,\" Samantha mutters beside you with a satisfied smirk.\n\nYou nudge her with your elbow. \"Assuming we don't get arrested.\"\n\n\"Meh, it'd be worth it,\" she says simply.\n\nThe main gate looms ahead. It's lined with blue and black balloons, and a couple of large Panther banners flap overhead. As you pass through, a voice calls out to you with unexpected enthusiasm.\n\n\"Welcome, welcome! Go Panthers!\"\n\nYou blink.\n\nA girl with striking blue hair and a little star sticker on her cheek beams at you. There are stickers, mini foam claws, temporary tattoos, and more in her hands. You don't recognize her, but she radiates so much school pride.\n\n\"Here!\" she says, handing you a little plastic flag on a stick. \"Take some merch. Panther pride, baby! You two better be screaming louder than the Wolves fans, alright? Go Panthers!\"\n\nSamantha flashes her a lazy salute. \"We'll do our best, merch goddess.\"\n\nYou nod. \"Thanks...\"\n\n\"No problem!\" she chirps, already turning to the next group of people with the same level of energy.\n\n\"She's a lot,\" you murmur under your breath as you and Samantha move away.\n\n\"Yeah, but in a fun way. I like her,\" Samantha says, waving the stupid flag.\n\nYou and Samantha weave around the crowd, stepping over backpacks and walking around clusters of students. You two eventually make your way to the back, where there are much fewer people. Then you spot Vincent.\n\nHe's perched stiffly on the bench in the very back, arms tightly crossed, knees awkwardly pressed together like he's trying to take up as little space as physically possible. His wide eyes scan the field like he's on high alert. But it's not the game that has him so rattled.\n\nIt's Aurora, who's sitting right next to him.\n\nHer legs are crossed, her hands folded neatly in her lap, and her posture is perfect. It's like she's sitting for a gothic portrait rather than a high school football game. Her expression is so unreadable that it's unnerving.\n\nVincent spots you and Samantha and starts begging.\n\n\"[name]!\" he calls, voice pitching higher than usual. \"Save me. Please.\"\n\nSamantha raises an eyebrow. \"What, are you being held hostage?\"\n\n\"I came up here to be alone and do some research, and then she sat down right next to me. On purpose. Like I wasn't already sitting here!\"\n\nAurora doesn't even blink.\n\n\"You looked lonely,\" she says calmly, eyes still fixed on the field.\n\n\"I was lonely!\" Vincent insists. \"That was the whole point!\"\n\nShe tilts her head just slightly. \"Silence shared is still silence. Besides, you looked like an abandoned cat. It felt wrong to ignore it.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" Samantha exclaims, snorting. \"You really are being held hostage.\"\n\n\"I'm not kidding,\" Vincent whispers dramatically. \"She hasn't blinked in like three minutes. I think she reads minds.\"\n\nAurora turns to him and finally smiles. \"Only yours.\"\n\nVincent's soul visibly leaves his body for a second.\n\nYou're trying not to laugh as Samantha drags you forward. \"Okay, okay, make room, Vincent. We're your reinforcements now.\"\n\n\"You're the best,\" he sighs in relief, already scooting down the bench and muttering something.\n\nSamantha drops next to Vincent while you take the seat next to Aurora. Aurora acknowledges your presence with a soft nod.\n\n\"Hey,\" she says.\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\nSamantha kicks her feet out in front of her, stretching. \"Let's get comfy.

      "text": "\"So,\" you say to Vincent, \"do you think magic is real?\"\n\n Vincent immediately straightens up. \"Oh, definitely not. I mean, there's no empirical evidence for any of that. Every time someone claims a spell or a summoning or whatever, it turns out to be illusion, misdirection, or some other trick. The entire notion of magic historically arose from our lack of understanding of natural phenomena. Thunder was once magic. Disease was magic. Now? Germ theory, electricity, quantum mechanics.\"\n\n He gestures vaguely toward the field, his voice gaining speed like a diesel locomotive.\n\n \"And if you look at it sociologically, magic was often used as a tool of power or control. Witch trials, fear-mongering, mass delusions, all that. And let's not even get started on alchemy, which, while fascinating, is not science. So no, magic as it's traditionally presented, doesn't hold up under scrutiny.\"\n\n You glance at Samantha. She's staring at you with that look that you know all too well.\n\n Vincent isn't done.\n\n \"Plus, from a philosophical standpoint, if you define magic as something that violates the laws of physics, then by definition it can't exist. Because once something becomes observable and measurable, it ceases to be magic and becomes science. Arthur C. Clarke's third law says that 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' Right? So half the stuff people used to call magic we now explain through complex or totally grounded principles of chemistry or—\"\n\n It's about then that he registers the quiet.\n\n You, Samantha, and even some kid two rows down are staring at him. But more importantly, so is Aurora. She hasn't moved, but her purple eyes are locked on Vincent. They're calm and patient, like she's waiting to see how this all ends.\n\n Vincent swallows. \"...But,\" he says quietly, \"uh... there's always a chance. I guess. That, you know... something might still be out there. Something we just don't understand yet. Doesn't mean it's not real.\"\n\n Aurora tilts her head slightly before muttering, \"Wise.\"\n\n Vincent lets out a tiny, terrified laugh and goes back to fidgeting with his phone.\n\n \"Dude, I don't know if I'm with Vincent here,\" Samantha whispers into your ear. \"Aurora's got powers. I'm not even joking.\"\n\n She's not wrong, but you can't say that.\n\n \n \n You shift slightly on the bench, glancing at Aurora beside you. Her posture is oddly perfect, like she's watching a different game altogether.\n\n Out of curiosity, you lean over a bit and ask, \"So... do you believe in science?\"\n\n Vincent scoffs instantly. \"Of course science is real. What kind of a question is tha—\"\n\n He stops.\n\n Aurora has turned to look at him with a steady gaze.\n\n Vincent's voice dies in his throat. He straightens his glasses, then sinks down slightly in his seat.\n\n You turn back to Aurora, half amused. \"Well?\"\n\n For a moment, you expect her to stay cryptic. But then she beings to speak.\n\n \"Science is a language,\" she says. \"A way to interpret the world. The formulas and laws aren't wrong, but they're just one of many lenses. There are things older than science. Patterns in dreams. Whispers in salt. Shadows that move when no one's watching. Science explains what we can measure. But it doesn't stop the unmeasurable from being real.\"\n\n Samantha stiffens beside you.\n\n Aurora's gaze returns to the field. \"The mistake is thinking that mystery is ignorance. Sometimes, the unknown is intentional.\"\n\n You blink.\n\n Vincent looks like he's trying to become one with the bench.\n\n \"Yeah,\" Samantha says, leaning over and hissing in your ear. \"She's off her rocker.\"\n \n\n[Choice: Game time!]",

The floodlights turn on, blazing bright and casting harsh white beams across the field. The crowd swells in anticipation as the band begins playing a thunderous tune. Even the fog machines begin to hiss from the far end of the field.\n\nThe machine roars as confetti and streamers explode in a burst of blue and black. Then, with a shout, the Panthers charge onto the field. They burst out, each one of them grinning wide and whooping like they've already won. The cheerleaders are at the sidelines, doing everything they can to build energy.\n\nThe crowd goes absolutely wild.\n\n\"YEAH, PANTHERS!\" someone shouts, voice cracking with excitement.\n\nSamantha cups her hands and hollers, \"LET'S GO, PACIFIC CREST!\" with enough volume to rattle your eardrum.\n\nVincent covers his ears, but can't stop smiling. Even Aurora claps a little, albeit with her gaze fixed on the players as if reading their futures.\n\nThe music pounds louder, layered now with the screams of the home crowd. In the tunnel, the last of the streamers shoot out. The bleachers tremble under the collective jumping.\n\n \n \n The fog machines whir up for the second time, and the crowd quiets down as they brace for the Wolves' arrival.\n\n A sharp burst of blue and black explodes from the machine.\n\n For a split second, there's only confusion. You watch Sierra Heights players start to jog out into the field, only to hesitate. One of them turns his head up, clearly noticing the error. Another slows to stare at the swirling blue and black ribbons raining down from above.\n\n \"Wait, isn't that our colors?\" someone shouts in the crowd.\n\n But the team keeps going. A few of the players shrug, and one just throws his hands up. A few Pacific Crest students snicker. Samantha stifles a laugh behind her hand.\n\n \"They think it's a glitch,\" you whisper.\n\n \"Perfect,\" she replies. \"Nothing throws you off like a system error you're trying to play cool.\"\n\n The Wolves recover rather quickly, continuing their run onto the field, but it's not quite as cohesive. They look a little unsure, like they're trying to figure out what the hell just happened.\n\n You can't help but grin.\n \n \n The marching band begins playing again and the tunnel fills with smoke.\n\n Then a wave of streamers blasts out of the machine.\n\n But instead of the red and silver, it's brownish-green. A sickly tone that resembles vomit. The confetti catches in the air, and a few pieces even flutter straight into the Wolves' faces.\n\n \"What the hell?\" one of them mutters.\n\n Another player recoils, trying to swat the color away. One guy stumbles over his feet in disbelief. A girl from the Sierra Heights section makes a sound like she just swallowed a bug.\n\n You and Samantha are dying of laughter.\n\n \"Oh my God,\" she whispers, practically keeling over next to you. \"This is the best thing we've ever done.\"\n\n One of the Wolves reaches up and rips a streamer from the air, staring at it in horror.\n\n \"I feel like I just ran through a diaper,\" someone mutters.\n\n You bite your knuckle to keep from losing it completely.\n\n \"Confidence officially lowered,\" Samantha states with a victorious smirk.\n \n\n \n The fog machine roars to life again as the Pacific Crest crowd dies down. From the same tunnel, the Sierra Heights Wolves make their entrance.\n\n The streamers and confetti burst forth in a cloud of red and silver. The team charges forward with confidence, arms pumping, helmets gleaming under the stadium lights.\n\n The crowd on their side cheers just as hard, with students waving crimson flags and silver pom-poms.\n\n Samantha exhales, unimpressed.\n\n \"They rehearse that or something?\" you ask.\n\n \"I don't know, dude,\" she mutters.\n\n You watch as the Wolves line up, calm and poised. Their entrance was perfect. For a second, you wonder if Pacific Crest really has a shot.\n \n\n\"Let's fight, Panthers! Blue and white, we own the night!\"\n\nThe cheer squad are in a formation that you can tell they've practiced a hundred times. They're down one person, you can tell. The symmetry's just slightly off. One of the stunt formations is missing a base, and the pyramid they build doesn't go as high as it should. But what they do pull off? It's still impressive.\n\nThe crowd eats it up.\n\nIt looks like fun, even from here. Maybe a little scary too. You wonder how different things would've been in another world where you joined. If you'd been the one launching into flips.\n\nStill, even without you, the team holds their own. They're not perfect, but they're proud, loud, and fierce.\n\nAnd maybe that's what matters.\n\nThe cheerleaders jog off the field with a bunch of grins, waving to the crowd as the music fades.\n\nSamantha leans in. \"Alright,\" she says. \"Let's see if our panthers can handle the wolves.\"\n\n\"Good evening, Pacific Crest High!\"\n\nThe booming voice of the stadium announcer cuts through the music. The band tapers off and the crowd claps politely before falling to a hush.\n\n\"Welcome to the 2024 Homecoming Game! Tonight, your very own Pacific Crest Panthers will take on the visiting Sierra Heights Wolves in what promises to be an unforgettable matchup. We've got a packed house tonight, an exciting halftime performance, and plenty of school spirit. Let's make some noise!\"\n\nThe bleachers erupt in cheers, the applause roaring.\n\n\"Let's bring out our team captains for the coin toss!\"\n\nJordan walks forward with three other players, helmet under his arm and expression sharp with focus. The visiting team's captain approaches from the opposite end of the field, meeting at the fifty-yard line with the referee, who holds a silver coin in one hand.\n\nThe mic picks up the exchange as the ref holds up the coin. \"Heads is the school logo, tails is the state seal. Sierra Heights, you're the visiting team. Call it in the air.\"\n\nThe Wolves' captain, a tall, broad guy with a buzz-cut, nods and calls, \"Heads.\"\n\nThe coin goes into the air, arcing high under the field lights. It spins before landing flat in the grass.\n\n\"Looks like it's heads! Sierra Heights wins the toss. They've elected to receive.\"\n\nThe kicker for the Wolves plants his cleats into the turf, the ball poised on the tee.\n\nA pause.\n\nA whistle.\n\nAnd then his leg swings forward in a smooth, practiced arc, sending the ball soaring into the air.\n\n[Choice: The game begins!]",

You watch from your spot in the bleachers as the cheer team launches into the halftime routine.\n\nIt's clean, even impressive. They hit their stunts with solid control, their formations are sharp, and the timing stays mostly tight. There's a tiny stumble in the basket toss, but the flyer (who looks oddly smug) sticks the landing like a pro.\n\nBy the time the team hits their final pose, the stadium's on its feet. It's not perfect, but it's really damn good. The kind of performance that keeps the momentum firmly with the Panthers.\n\nAs the cheerleaders head off, the field is empty. A few football players are throwing the ball around, but most are catching their breath and grabbing water. Helmets come off, towels come out, and coaches give pep talks. Everyone's sweating, but fired up.\n\nSamantha stretches her arms behind her head. \"I'm gonna go grab snacks,\" she announces. \"Need fuel for the trash I'll be talking once we win.\"\n\nShe hops down the stairs with a bounce, turning back just long enough to toss you a look. \"Want anything, [name]?\"\n\nBefore you can answer, Aurora stands up too. She brushes down her purple plaid skirt and says calmly, \"I need to investigate something.\"\n\n\"Investigate?\" you ask, blinking.\n\nShe doesn't elaborate. Just tucks a lock of purple-streaked hair behind her ear and drifts away into the crowd. Classic Aurora.\n\nVincent, looking overwhelmed by the noise and crowd and Aurora's general existence, scoots further into the corner of the bench. \"I'll just.... stay here,\" he mumbles. \"Guard everything.\"\n\nAnd that just leaves you.\n\nYou watch Samantha weaving toward the concessions, already arguing with someone. you glance the other way, where Aurora has nearly disappeared. And next to you, Vincent sits clutching a sticker sheet like it's somehow going to save him from all this.\n\n[Choice: Go with Samantha]\n[Choice: Follow Aurora]\n[Choice: Stay with Vincent]",

      "text": "The line at the concession stand crawls forward. You find Samantha tapping her fingers against her thigh, arms crossed, eyes narrowed in deep contemplation. Not about anything important, no. That wouldn't be Samantha. She's in a battle with herself.\n\n \"Cheese or no cheese,\" she mutters, staring at the bag of hot chips. \"That is the question.\"\n\n You glance over at her, raising a brow. \"You really like hot chips that much?\"\n \n \"[name], what the hell are you talking about?\" she asks, like you've said the dumbest thing she's ever heard in her entire life. \"Hot chips are the most important food group.\"\n\n You blink. \"They are not a food group.\"\n\n \"Oh, I'm sorry. Did you wake up and decide to be the FDA?\" she says. \"Hot chips are crunchy, spicy, and messy in the best way. They're pure chaos, and I've got to respect that.\"\n\n \"...Okay.\"\n\n She ignores your dubious tone and continues. \"And then there's the cheese. That's what I'm conflicted about. Sometimes, cheese enhances. Sometimes, it drowns the chip. Too much, and it turns into a soggy mess. Too little, and it's dry. It's a delicate balance.\"\n\n \"I've never heard you even half this passionate about our classwork,\" you murmur under your breath.\n\n \"Yeah, 'cause none of our classes offered hot chips.\"\n\n The people in front of you move aside. You're next.\n\n \"Okay, you know what?\" she says, turning to you. \"I'm trusting you with this choice. Cheese or no cheese?\"\n\n [Choice: Cheese]\n [Choice: No cheese]\n\n \n \n You follow Aurora through the tunnel, weaving around stragglers and students until you're away from the crowds. The moment you're far enough from the noise, her gait changes, becoming slower and more deliberate. She doesn't speak, but the air around her ripples with a strange energy. It's not just the way she moves, either. There's something about her sheer presence alone that makes you instinctively stay quiet.\n\n She stops near the bottom of the stairs, eyes narrowing at a hairline crack in the cement wall. It's completely unremarkable until it just isn't. A soft shimmer runs along the surface. You blink, and it's gone.\n\n You step a little closer. \"What is this?\"\n\n \"There's something wrong at Pacific Crest,\" she murmurs, voice low.\n\n You frown. \"Wrong how, exactly?\"\n\n Aurora crouches down and extends her hand just above the crack. Her fingertips never touch it, but a flicker of purple light pulses from her palm. Delicate tendrils spill out. They're faint at first, but quickly sharpen into distinct runes that rotate in the air before fading into smoke.\n\n \"I can't tell you much,\" she says, straightening up. \"Not yet.\"\n\n You take a slow breath, trying to wrap your head around what you're seeing.\n\n \"Are you tracking something?\" you ask. \"Something magical?\"\n\n She doesn't answer, instead opting to step back. A wisp of amethyst smoke trails from her sleeve and dissipates before it can touch the air. You keep following her, letting her do whatever the hell she's doing. Eventually, you speak again.\n\n \"You sure you can't tell me anything?\"\n\n Aurora stops mid-step. You think she might ignore you again, but instead, she turns. There's something indulgent in the way she tilts her head at you.\n\n \"You ask a lot of questions.\"\n\n \"I mean, can you blame me? Look at you.\"\n\n She lifts a hand and closes it slowly, gathering the fading mana into her fist. The glow dies, but the tension remains.\n\n \"Fine,\" she says after a long pause. \"One question. Just one.\"\n\n You blink. \"Seriously?\"\n\n She nods, the faintest glimmer of a challenge in her gaze. \"But make it count.\"\n\n [Choice: What exactly is wrong at Pacific Crest?]\n [Choice: Have you done this kind of thing before?]\n [Choice: Am I involved in any of this?]\n\n \n \n The stands have thinned out a bit during halftime, the crowd either stretching their legs or rushing toward snack lines. The band shuffles somewhere in the background while the cheerleaders are celebrating. You sit back against the bleachers, letting your shoulders drop for the first time in while.\n\n Beside you, Vincent is still holding his notebook protectively. You glance at him, then down at the notebook in his lap.\n\n \"Can I see it?\" you ask.\n\n He hesitates. \"My notebook?\"\n\n \"No, your secret journal,\" you joke, smirking. \"Yes, your notebook.\"\n\n Vincent flushes, his fingers twitching against the cover. \"It's just class notes. Really boring. Probably not your thing.\"\n\n \"I'm bored,\" you say simply. \"Entertain me. I promise I won't judge.\"\n\n He reluctantly chuckles before finally sliding the spiral-bound notebook into your hands. You flip it open, expecting page after page of history. And, to be fair, you do get that. But what really catches your attention is the artwork.\n\n Scattered among the notes are dozens of penciled-in illustrations. They aren't just doodles either, they're really good. Tiny vignettes of the past, nestled between bullet points and historical analysis. Knights charging across foggy battlefields. Camel caravans winding between sandstone cliffs. Soldiers mid-fire from wars that went down centuries ago, uniforms perfectly rendered.\n \n \"Holy shit,\" you say under your breath, flipping back and forth between pages. \"Vincent... these are insane. You drew all this?\"\n\n He shrugs sheepishly. \"Yeah. Drawing helps me focus. If I don't do something with my hands, I start overthinking everything. My brain starts going off on its own.\"\n\n You pause on a two-page spread: a siege scene, complete with battering rams, arrows, and tiny individual soldiers retreating behind cover.\n\n \"And this helps you focus?\" you ask.\n\n Vincent nods. \"It really does. I just... I don't know. History feels more real when I draw it. Like I'm actually there, not just memorizing names and dates. Imagining what they saw, smelled, heard, felt, all that. If I can picture it, i can understand it better.\"\n\n You flip to another page, and this one is covered in careful drawings of early firearms. Muskets, pistols, even a revolver. All labeled in fine pen with the names and manufacturing dates.\n\n \"So, I'm guessing you're a weapons nerd?\" you tease.\n\n \"A little,\" Vincent admits. \"Mostly historical ones. It's fascinating how much you can learn from just one weapon. It's design, materials, even the politics of the time. For example, the French 1777 Charleville musket was standard issue for Napoleon's army. It reflects how France was advancing and refining its military-industrial capacity. They were improving standardization, interchangeability, and accuracy. They had to, in order to go up against the British.\"\n\n You blink. \"That was a lot of detail really fast.\"\n\n He laughs quietly, rubbing the back of his neck. \"Sorry. I tend to do that.\"\n\n \"No, it's cool,\" you say honestly. \"You clearly do love this stuff.\"\n\n He shrugs again. \"It just feels important. Like, so many people have been born and lived before dying. The world we have now, every single inch of it, was shaped by people most of us don't even remember. I don't want to forget them.\"\n\n You turn another page and find a stylized map full of rivers, mountains, and kingdoms. Definitely not real.\n\n \"And this?\" you ask.\n\n \"Oh, that's just from a worldbuilding project,\" he says, grinning faintly. \"It has sky pirates.\"\n\n \"Of course it has sky pirates.\"\n\n He finally laughs. Not awkwardly, but genuinely.\n\n You point to one of the drawings.\n\n [Choice: Tell me more about the knight]\n [Choice: Why the camels?]\n [Choice: I've gotta hear about the sky pirates]",

      "text": "\"Cheese,\" you say. \"Gotta go all in.\"\n\n Samantha squints at you before turning to the snack vendor. \"Hot chips with cheese, please.\"\n\n The guy takes her cash, and she's handed a steaming cardboard tray filled to the brim with hot chips drenched in orange cheese. It smells artificial and probably has way too much sodium, but that's not your concern.\n\n You both walk back to the bleachers, Samantha carefully balancing her prize. The moment you sit down, she digs in, scooping up a chip and popping it into her mouth.\n\n There's a pause before her lips slowly press into an unimpressed line.\n\n She grabs another chip. Another chip. Chews thoughtfully.\n\n Then she lowers the tray onto her lap, glances sideways at you, and says, \"I feel so betrayed right now.\"\n\n You blink. \"Already?\"\n\n \"Dude, they're soggy,\" she says, lifting a limp chip to illustrate. \"Do you see this? This is not the crisp experience I was promised. Not. Even. Close. This is a soggy abomination pretending to be food.\"\n\n \"You said they were the perfect snack.\"\n\n \"They are,\" she shoots back. \"When they're hot and chip. Not wet and... sad.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath. \"You're being dramatic.\"\n\n \"I trusted you with a critical decision,\" she says, dramatically wiping nonexistent tears from her eye. \"And now here I am, wallowing in disappointment and shitty dairy.\"\n\n \"You've still gone through, like, twenty of them.\"\n\n \"Twenty too many.\" She lifts another floppy chip for emphasis. \"It's delicious, but that's because it's a hot chip, not despite it.\"\n\n \"So next time, you want me to say no cheese?\" you ask, snorting.\n\n \"Yes,\" Samantha says. \"I would not feel this betrayed right now if you didn't tell me to get cheese.\"\n\n But even as she grumbles, she pops another chip into her mouth. And another.\n\n \"You're still eating them though,\" you comment.\n\n \"Still hot chips,\" she mumbles between bites.\n \n \n \"No cheese,\" you declare with a shrug.\n\n Samantha squints at you before mumbling, \"You better be right about this.\"\n\n A few minutes later, you're back in your seats, a paper tray of bright red chips balanced in her hands. They smell like spice. You glance over as she digs in, crunching through the first few with purpose.\n\n But by the fourth chip, she pauses.\n\n She lifts a chip slowly, staring at it with a look of pure disappointment. Then she turns to you with the heavy weariness of someone who has known loss in its purest form.\n\n \"I feel betrayed,\" she says flatly.\n\n You blink. \"You literally said you trusted me.\"\n\n \"Yeah, and let me tell you, that was my first mistake.\" She pops another chip into her mouth. She's resigned, like someone who's finishing a subpar meal out of principle. \"[name], these are dry.\"\n\n \"They're still good, though.\"\n\n \"They're fine,\" she admits. \"But they could've been transcendent.\"\n\n You laugh under your breath. \"You're being dramatic.\"\n\n \"Am I?\" she shoots back with her signature sarcastic edge. \"Because I think what's actually dramatic is how you singlehandedly robbed this moment of its potential. I was ready for cheese nirvana, [name]. And instead I'm sitting here eating whatever this is.\"\n\n \"You act like I ruined your entire week.\"\n\n \"I'm just saying, next time I say I trust you with something important, maybe remember that you once said 'no cheese.'\"\n\n Another chip disappears into her mouth. She makes a disappointed little \"hmph\" sound as she crunches.\n\n \"Would've been better with cheese,\" she mutters.\n\n \"Duly noted,\" you mutter, leaning back. \"Cheese next time.\"\n\n <<if [transgender] > 14>> \n Samantha nods. \"Good. Learn from your mistakes.\" Then, under her breath, \"Can't believe I let my best friend decide my toppings.\"\n \n \n Samantha nods. \"Good. Learn from your mistakes.\" Then, under her breath, \"Can't believe I let a man decide my toppings.\"\n \n\n You laugh.\n \n\n \n \n \"What exactly is wrong at Pacific Crest?\" you ask.\n\n Aurora doesn't stop walking. \"I don't know,\" she says, flatly.\n\n You frown. \"Come on. You said I could ask one question. That's my question.\"\n\n \"I am answering,\" she says, casting a glance over her shoulder. \"I literally don't know.\"\n\n You blink. That's... not what you expected. \"Wait, really?\"\n\n Aurora finally slows to a stop by a window. A purple shimmer pulses faintly from her palm, spreading the mist over the glass before vanishing. She lets out a quiet breath.\n\n \"There's something here,\" she murmurs. \"Something wrong. I can feel it. The signs are scattered and hidden, but I have enough to know it's going to be big.\"\n\n You stay quiet, letting her continue.\n\n \"I've been dong this a long time,\" she says, eyes scanning the distance like she's reading something in the shadows. \"Long enough to trust my instincts when they tell me something's off. Even when—no, especially when I can't see the shape of it yet.\"\n\n There's only calm conviction in her voice. It's almost unsettling, how certain she is. You glance around. Everything's been normal today. It's hard to imagine anything ominous happening at your mundane high school.\n\n \"And... it's your job to fix it?\" you ask.\n\n \"It's always my job,\" she mutters.\n\n She doesn't explain what that means, but her tone doesn't invite further questions. You watch her silently for a moment, noting again the slight weariness in her posture. It's not exhaustion, just a weight she's learned to carry well.\n\n You take a breath, the sounds of the game drifting in from a distance. Aurora's already moving again, drawn by something only she can sense. And without really thinking, you follow.\n \n \n You glance at her, brow raised. \"Have you done this kind of thing before?\"\n\n Aurora doesn't answer immediately. Her pause is long enough to feel deliberate, but not so long that you think she didn't hear you. Her gaze lingers on the night sky just beyond the window, and for a moment, you wonder if she's even going to acknowledge the question at all.\n\n Then she speaks softly.\n\n \"Many times.\"\n\n You blink, caught off guard by the clarity of the answer. \"Wait, really?\"\n\n \"It's sort of been my responsibility,\" she says. \"For a while now.\"\n\n That's all she offers.\n\n You open her mouth to ask more, but something about her posture stops you. She's not being evasive for no reason like usual. There's a kind of weight in her voice. Not secrecy for secrecy's sake, but like someone who's learned that saying less is safer. Someone who's carried this around longer than they should've.\n\n You study her for a moment in the moonlight. Her expression is neutral as always. Always unreadable. Always calm. But now that you're really looking, you notice something else: a slight tiredness at the corner of her eyes. The quiet kind of tiredness that doesn't come from missing sleep.\n\n You swallow. \"So you're like... Crestview Bay's secret magical investigator?\"\n\n That earns you the faintest smile. It's not a full grin, not even close, but it is something. She still doesn't answer. Just steps past you, making her way back to the bleachers.\n\n You trail after her in silence, letting the question hang between you. You don't need her to say anything else to know she's done this before. And you don't need her to say anything else to know she'll be doing it again.\n \n \n You swallow and ask, \"Am I involved in any of this?\"\n\n Aurora doesn't look up, but she does pause. The purple shimmer fades from her hand as she exhales. She turns her head just enough to meet your gaze. Her dark violet eyes hold yours like she's seeing something deeper than your face.\n\n \"You are.\"\n\n Your heart gives a confused thud. \"What?\" you ask, voice quieter now. \"How can you tell? What's going to happen?\"\n\n Aurora shakes her head.\n\n \"I don't know,\" she says softly. \"Not yet.\"\n\n \"So I'm involved, but you don't know how?\" you ask, blinking.\n\n \"I know you're going to be a part of it,\" she says again, simply. \"You're connected to it. That's all I can feel for now. But something is pulling at the threads, and you're one of them.\"\n\n You run a hand through your hair, stomach turning. \"But I don't want to be involved.\"\n\n It slips out too fast and too raw, but you really do mean it. You didn't sign up for anything like this. You're not a hero. You're just... you. Someone who came to watch a football game. And now, for whatever reason, you're tangled up in something far bigger than yourself.\n\n Aurora doesn't answer right away. She turns, brushing past you as she steps away from the window. The glow at her fingertips has gone dim. It's just skin, ordinary and human.\n\n \"I didn't want to be either,\" she says, voice low.\n\n You look at her and there's something tired in the way she says it. Not just weary from the long day, but something older. A weight she's used to carrying. A choice she never got to make.\n\n You don't say anything after that.\n \n\n \n \n \"Tell me more about the knight,\" you say, tapping the edge of Vincent's notebook where the knight is charging. The armor gleams with sharp, layered strokes. The chainmail peeks out beneath the plated shoulders, a long cape whipping behind them. A lion crest is drawn across the chestplate in metallic gold ink.\n\n Vincent perks up immediately.\n\n \"Oh! That one's from the High Middle Ages, probably around the 12th century,\" he says, already flipping to a page filled with diagrams of armor, labeled with careful handwriting. \"That was kind of the golden age of knighthood. You know, before gunpowder and longbows made the whole 'walking tank' thing a lot less viable.\"\n\n You nod, and he's off.\n\n \"So, knights weren't just sword-swinging brutes. They were actually part of a super rigid social structure. You didn't just wake up one day and decide to be a knight. You had to be born into nobility, start training as a page when you were, like, seven, then become a squire. And only after years of that, usually by your early twenties, you would oftentimes get knighted by someone important.\"\n\n He flips again, revealing a breakdown of weapons and their uses: longsword, lance, flanged mace. There's even a labeled drawing of a destrier, which is apparently a type of warhorse bred for strength and endurance.\n\n \"They were like the elite warriors of their time. Super expensive to train and equip. That's why most knights also owned land and had vassals and peasants farming for them and all that. That money funded their gear. Some of them had multiple horses. One for travel, one for battle, one for tournaments, and a couple of backups in case one broke its leg.\"\n\n \"When am I getting five horses?\" you joke.\n \n \"When you become a knight,\" he replies, grinning. \"And then there's the chivalric code, which wasn't actually that widespread or consistent. It's just been romanticized like crazy afterward. Y'know what I mean. Honor, bravery, protecting the weak, loyalty to your liege. Most of that came after the fact. Like retroactive PR.\"\n\n \"Your drawings are great,\" you say. \"It's like he belongs to something bigger.\"\n\n Vincent goes quiet at that, then gently closes his notebook.\n\n \"Thanks,\" he says, smiling in that awkward but sincere way of his. \"For letting me ramble. Most people just don't care.\"\n\n \"I do,\" you say, meaning it.\n \n \n \"Why the camels?\" you ask, your eyes landing on the drawing of a caravan. There are half a dozen camels, roped together, with tiny bundles strapped to their backs and riders in windblown cloaks.\n\n Vincent looks up and smiles.\n\n \"Oh. Oh! Okay, so these aren't just any camels,\" he says, scooting a little closer and flipping to the next page, which is marked with terrain maps and trade routes in different colored pens. \"These are Bactrian camels. Two humps, not one. That's important because they were native to Central Asia, especially places like the Gobi Desert, and they were basically the engines of the Silk Road.\"\n\n Vincent continues, already in lecture mode. \"So, during the height of the Silk Road, camel caravans were essential. Bactrian camels could go without water for literal days, carrying hundreds of pounds of goods. They could pass through deserts and mountains. Horses and wagons couldn't really compete in many of these stretches. It was just camels.\"\n\n You nod slowly as he warms up even more.\n\n \"How do I put this. These camels were basically the long-haul trucks of the ancient world. People would trade all across Central Asia, through cities like Samarkand and Dunhuang. China would export a bunch of super valuable stuff like silk, porcelain, and tea. In return, they'd get things like wool, glassware, and gold. Hell, even ideas. Religions like Buddhism spread thanks to these routes.\"\n\n Another flip. Another diagram. This one's got figures in flowing robes, camels kneeling at a market square, little coin purses with currency you don't recognize. The detail is ridiculous.\n\n \"The thing is, most people think trade was just you dropping your stuff off and then going home,\" Vincent says, gesturing excitedly. \"But if you study it, it really wasn't It was like a relay system. No one went all the way from Xi'an to Constantinople. Goods would change hands dozens of times. Prices would increase, languages would shift, stories would mutate. Camels were at the heart of that. They connected the dots. God, they are so underappreciated.\"\n\n You grin, genuinely impressed. \"That's actually really cool.\"\n\n \"Right?\" he says, like he's been waiting for years to say that. \"They look a bit silly, but they're legends. Without them, the Silk Road wouldn't have been the same. No vast caravans, no great exchange of cultures, no Marco Polo. They held the whole thing together.\"\n\n You glance at the caravan one last time. Each camel is distinct, marked with tiny symbols on their saddlebags. One even has a patterned blanket on his back. You hadn't realized how much care he'd put into them until now.\n\n Quietly, you close the notebook and hand it back.\n\n \"Thanks for showing me,\" you say.\n\n Vincent holds it close for a second. \"Thanks for listening.\"\n \n \n \"I've gotta hear about the sky pirates,\" you say, grinning as you point at the jagged coastline and cluster of airships on Vincent's hand-drawn map.\n\n Vincent blinks, startled. It's like he hadn't expected you take an interest. Then a shy but unmistakably proud smile tugs at his mouth. He adjusts his glasses and leans in a bit.\n\n \"Okay, so,\" he begins, flipping to another page filled with tiny airship silhouettes and annotated sketches of floating islands. \"They're not technically pirates. The official term is skyraiders, but everyone just calls them pirates because they don't pay port taxes and rob people.\"\n\n You laugh softly, and he continues, warming up now.\n\n \"Most of the story takes place in the Azure Belt. That's a cluster of floating continents suspended over a shattered sea. People live up there now because the surface got, like, totally wrecked in the Collapse. Some kind of ancient magical-tech war a thousand years ago. It's not really important what caused it, just that it broke the world and now gravity's all weird.\"\n\n He flips the page again, revealing a rough blueprint of a massive airship with mechanical wings and hull plating. There are notes in the margins: steam core balance? turret on deck? use griffin feathers for drift tech???\n\n \"There's like four major factions, right?\" Vincent says, tapping the page. \"You've got the Dawn Accord, who pretends to be all noble but are actually super corrupt. Then there's the Iron Vow, who run the black-market trade routes. The Coral Syndicate controls the water access. And finally, the pirates, who are basically unaffiliated sky scum just trying to stay alive.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"Sky scum?\"\n\n \"In a good way!\" he insists. \"They're scrappy and cool. Their hygiene though...\"\n\n You snort, and he chuckles before continuing, flipping through more drawings. There are rusted cities suspended on chains from drifting mountains, a flying cathedral-ship, and a crew featuring a scowling woman with a peg leg and a robot parrot.\n\n \"And they all fly through these permanent cloudstorms that kind of act like sea currents. Pirates use them to hide, launch ambushes, or slip between borders. They have old maps of the windstreams from the pre-Collapse days, but they're half-lost and written in dead languages.\"\n\n He's moving quickly now, flipping from one page to another, barely giving you time to register the sheer volume of worldbuilding he's packed into this spiral notebook. There are whole sections with super dramatic headings like The Oracle Isles or The Fallen King. One has sketches of ceremonial coins used to buy passage through skygrave ruins.\n\n \"This is crazy detailed,\" you murmur, flipping back to the map.\n\n \"I've been working on it since middle school,\" he admits, cheeks going pink. \"Like... not every day, but I'll think of something and add it in. I've got five notebooks at home. This one's just the geography and military stuff. I have a whole one just for flags.\"\n\n You stare at him, not sure whether to be impressed or overwhelmed. \"So what's the story about?\"\n\n Vincent blinks before his face falls into a sheepish smile. \"I, uh, haven't exactly figured that out yet. I keep meaning to, but every time I sit down to write it, I end up working on the history of the Coral Syndicate's marriage customs or redesigning the pirate bathrooms or... I don't know. I just like building the world.\"\n\n You laugh, and Vincent grins too.\n\n \"Well, at least when you do figure out the plot, you won't have to make up anything else,\" you say, handing the notebook back.\n\n He cradles the notebook and mutters, \"That's the hope.\"\n \n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Airhorns, clapping, screams, whistles. The marching band bursts into a triumphant fanfare as everyone leaps to their feet. The bleachers literally shake under the weight of all the jumping and cheering.\n\n\"And that's it! Final Score, 42-24! Pacific Crest takes the win for their 2024 Homecoming Game!\"\n\nYou get caught up in the tidal wave of sound, and for a moment just take it in. The energy. The chaos. The way people scream with their whole chests like it's the greatest moment in the world. People will be talking about it at the party. People will be talking about it on Monday. Hell, it might still be talked about next year.\n\nTo your right, Samantha throws both arms in the air with a victorious shout. \"Yesss! That's what I'm talking about, dude!\" Her voice is barely audible due to the roar around you, but her smile is unstoppable. She turns to you and punches you arm lightly. \"See, [name]. I told you we'd wipe the floor with 'em.\"\n\nA few rows ahead, someone is literally waving a giant flag like they're leading a medieval army into battle. The Pacific Crest student section chants something rude toward the Sierra Heights student section. The cheerleaders are jumping for joy. A couple of players are tossing their helmets and hugging like they just won the Superbowl. They didn't, of course, but it sure feels like it.\n\nVincent is hunched over his notebook, somehow still furiously scribbling something in the middle of all this. His glasses are slightly fogged from the chilly night air, but his pencil moves like he's documenting something important. He mumbles to himself as he sketches, eyes flicking between the field and the page.\n\nAnd then, to your left, there's Aurora.\n\nShe sits perfectly still, a few strands of her hair drifting in the breeze. She taps her foot, seemingly unconcerned about the game. It's like she knew Pacific Crest had the win far before the game even started.\n\nAs the stadium booms with celebration and the night air grows electric with victory, you can't help but wonder what comes next.\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Pacific Crest blue and black seem to shimmer in the air, carried on banners, jerseys, pom-poms, and streaks of face paint. The air just buzzes with victory.\n\nYou and Samantha make your way down the steps, weaving through clusters of students who shout congratulations and snap photos. Every few feet, someone is hugging a player or lifting their phone to record the chaos. You're not sure if there's an official celebration plan, but it's obvious no one wants the night to end.\n\n\"God, they're gonna be talking about this for weeks,\" Samantha says beside you, tugging her striped sleeves down as the wind picks up. \"We destroyed them.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" you say, grinning. \"That was unreal.\"\n\nNear the end zone, the cheerleaders are all excited, forming a celebratory huddle with a few players joining in. They're laughing and jumping, with some girls tossing their pompoms into the air. They try to form another pyramid, but everyone's laughing so hard that someone nearly tumbles backward. It's chaotic, joyous, and messy.\n\nAmidst it all, Luke comes jogging up to you and Samantha, wearing his helmet under one arm and a stupidly huge smile on his face. His ginger curls are damp with sweat, and he's basically vibrating with excitement.\n\n\"DID YOU SEE THAT?!\" he yells. \"That touchdown. I mean, I told coach I could do it! Did you see it?!\"\n\nSamantha opens her mouth to reply, but before she can, a pair of cheerleaders rush by and grab Luke by the arm.\n\n\"Luke! We're doing pictures! Come on!\" one of them calls.\n\n\"Oh! Uh...\" Luke says, looking at you two. \"I'll be back in like—just hold on a sec!\"\n\nHe's swept away before either of you can answer.\n\nSamantha sighs. \"Yeah, one sec my ass.\"\n\nYou laugh.\n\nA few moments later, Luke reappears from a different angle, eyes locking on you again.\n\n\"Okay! Can we talk about—\"\n\n\"Luke!\" a teammate grabs him this time. \"Coach wants a line-up shot, come on!\"\n\nLuke stumbles after him, looking over his shoulder apologetically. \"I swear, I'll be back!\"\n\nSamantha doesn't even bother answering this time. She just watches him vanish into the sea of people and exhales flatly. \"Yeah, the dude's gone. Let's just go.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" you agree, nodding. \"Good game, though.\"\n\nYou turn away from the field, making your way to the exit. You pass by a few clusters of students already discussing the afterparty. Apparently, it'll be at the local bowling alley, Velocity Lanes.\n\nJust as you two exit the stadium and round a corner, your gaze catches someone moving. He's alone, half-shadowed, and doesn't look like he's in a rush. It's clear he's slipping out before anyone notices.\n\nExcept, he does notice you.\n\nYour eyes meet.\n\nBrown.\n\n<<if [jordanRomance] > 9>>\n Jordan's expression shifts the second he sees you, eyes lighting up immediately. There's no hesitation. His smile isn't small or subtle, but it is shy, like a secret meant only for you. He slows just a beat longer than he needs to before slipping into the woods.\n<<elseif [jordanRelo] > 49>> \n Jordan's face softens with an easy warmth. The kind shared between two people who've known each other through more than a few ups and downs. He gives you a tired but genuine grin, lifts his hand in a low wave, then ducks into the woods with a nod.\n<<elseif [jordanRelo] > 29>> \n Jordan spots you and his expression flickers with recognition. It takes a second, but then he gives a short, relaxed smile. He doesn't stop walking, doesn't wave, just meets your gaze for a beat before disappearing into the woods.\n<<elseif [jordanRelo] > 14>> \n Jordan glances up, catches your eye, and seems to register your presence for a moment. His face remains neutral, and he turns away without slowing down. He ducks into the woods, already moving on from the moment.\n\n \n You can't make out any more details before he slips into the woods.\n \n\nSamantha squints after the retreating figure, one hand raised like she's shielding her eyes from the nonexistent sun.\n\n\"Who is that?\" she asks. \"I couldn't see. Was that someone important? Was it a moment?\"\n\nYou don't say anything, opting to just keep walking. And together, you leave the school grounds behind.\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Good choice,\" she says, already spinning on her heel. \"Let's humiliate some wolves.\"\n\nYou barely have time to open your mouth before she grabs your wrist and starts dragging you across the courtyard. The Pacific Crest library doors swing open with a creak, and within seconds, she's beelining toward the row of computers and printers near the back. It's a quiet corner that's usually used for printing essays and documents. Usually.\n\nSamantha slaps her laptop onto the table and opens it. \"Okay. The Sierra Heights team bus is arriving in thirty. That gives us fifteen minutes to print and prep. Ten minutes to deploy. Five to get out. We'll hang everything along the fence where they'll park, so the first thing they see when they step out is our school spirit.\"\n\nYou blink. \"We don't have a ton of time.\"\n\n\"It's fine, I was born for this,\" she says, eyes glued to the screen as she clicks through folders. \"Alright. I whipped these up in homeroom. You tell me which one's your headliner.\"\n\nShe turns the screen toward you and taps the trackpad. Three options blink back at you.\n\nPoster 1: \"Sierra Frights\"\nA crudely photoshopped image of the Sierra Heights wolf mascot hiding under a blanket, eyes wide with cartoonish fear. A massive Pacific Crest panther looms over it with glowing eyes, like a horror movie villain. The caption reads: \"Welcome to Panther Territory. Hope you packed your nightlight.\"\n\n''Poster 2: \"Baby's First Game\"''\nAn edit of the Sierra Heights football team from last year, except everyone's heads have been swapped with oversized baby faces. The Wolves' quarterback is wearing a bib. The caption says: \"Let the adults show you how it's done.\"\n\nPoster 3: \"Wolf Who?\"\nA missing poster with the Sierra Heights logo crossed out. It says: \"MISSING: Sierra Heights Wolves. Last seen fleeing from Pacific Crest High School. If found, remind them where they are.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow as you squint at the screen. \"Did you seriously photoshop all this?\"\n\n\"Yeah, of course,\" Samantha replies, connecting her laptop to the printer. \"I'm just really passionate about school spirit and constructive bullying.\"\n\nYou snort. \"Constructive?\"\n\n\"Oh, totally,\" she says, clicking through the printer settings with alarming speed. \"It's not bullying if it's in Comic Sans. That's just art.\"\n\nYou stare at the image of the terrified cartoon wolf hiding under a blanket, then over at the one with bib-wearing football babies. \"This is what you did in homeroom?\"\n\n\"Some people study. I slander. I think we all contribute in our own way,\" she says, shrugging. \"We don't have all day, though.

The \"art,\" if it can be called that, is goofy, but the intent is still clear: war.\n\n\"We're gonna run out of wall space before we run out of paper,\" you mutter, scanning for a clean spot.\n\n\"That's the goal, dude,\" Samantha says, sticking another poster to a low-hanging metal sign. \"This needs to be super visible.

Usually I just wear black and complain,\" she says, tossing you the tape roll. \"But today feels fun. I don't know why. Maybe I'm getting soft.\"\n\n\"You?

She peers through a gap in the hedge like a spy on a secret mission.\n\nA hiss, then the creak of hydraulic doors swinging open.\n\nOne by one, the Sierra Heights Wolves begin to hop off the bus. They're big, with wide shoulders, boxy faces, and big arms. They fan out in loose clumps, stretching, yawning, and jostling each other as they glance around.\n\nThen one of them sees a poster.\n\n\"Yo,\" a tall guy near the back says, pointing at the concrete wall. \"What the hell is that?\"\n\nAnother player follows his finger and immediately cracks up. \"Oh my God. Bro. Bro.\" He smacks the nearest teammate on the back. \"You see this?!\"\n\nEveryone goes to look at the poster you chose.\n\n\"Bro, that is fucked up,\" someone laughs.\n\n\"But it is kinda fire,\" another chimes in, already pulling out his phone to snap a picture.\n\nA third guy walks up, squints at the print, then yanks it clean off the wall. \"I'm taking this. This is going in my locker.\"\n\n\"You're gonna hang up our own slander?\" one of his teammates asks, snorting.\n\n\"Absolutely. It's funny as hell.\"\n\nYou watch from your hiding spot as the Wolves point, laugh, and call out to others still climbing off the bus. Some take selfies with them. One jokingly pretends to shrink away from it in fear, hands held up in mock surrender as his friends double over in laughter.\n\nSamantha doesn't move. Her eyes are narrowed, watching with the wary intensity of a general assessing a battle plan that may or may not have backfired. When the crowd starts to migrate toward the stadium entrance, still chuckling and buzzing with energy, she leans back, brushing leaves from her hoodie.\n\n\"Huh,\" she says.\n\nYou glance at her. \"That wasn't the reaction I was expecting.\"\n\n\"Nope.\" She crosses her arms over her knees. \"They're laughing at it. That means they're not scared. Or, they're playing it off.\"\n\n\"Playing it off?\" you echo.\n\nShe tilts her head. \"Yeah. I mean, c'mon now. What else would you do if you were publicly mocked in enemy territory? You either laugh or you look weak.\"\n\n\"So you're saying they're actually terrified.\"\n\n\"Exactly, [name].\"\n\nThe two of you crouch there for a second longer, silent as the bus engine finally shuts off and the last players disappear down the tunnel. The wind rustles the remaining posters just slightly, and somewhere behind you, a bird caws in the distance.

One has a cartoony panther giving a thumbs-up with the words \"Thanks for the win in advance!\" written below. Others are a LOT meaner. One says \"YOUR COACH ALREADY GAVE UP\" with panther claw marks on their mascot. You spot one particularly intense design featuring a scoreboard reading 56-0, with a crying wolf beneath it.\n\n\"Okay, strategist,\" Samantha says, waving the papers in your face. \"What's the tone? Are we playing it cute? Or are we going full war crime?\"\n\nYou look at the stack of paper. There's definitely a spectrum here. Some are just lighthearted teasing while others might give Sierra Heights psychological trauma. Samantha's waiting for an answer, her eyes glinting with that same dangerous glee she always gets right before a prank.\n\n[Choice: Be evil]\n[Choice: Be nice]",

She splits them in half then slides them into your hands. \"You're gonna love it. They're so savage.\"\n\n You both slip through the side doors of the football building and creep into the visiting locker room. It smells like bleach, faint sweat, and mop water. Not exactly great. The overhead lights are off, but just enough sunlight filters through the high frosted windows to see by. Lockers line the walls, most of them closed, their surfaces scratched and dented from seasons of visiting teams passing through.\n\n Samantha hands you a roll of tape. \"You take the left. Tape it up good. I want their self-esteem to rattle.\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow, but start toward your side of the room. The first sheet you look at is a mock newspaper headline: \"SIERRA HEIGHTS FORFEITS AFTER REALIZING THEY'RE BAD. Experts confirm that the Pacific Crest Panthers are actually built different.\"\n\n You let out a quiet chuckle and tape it right at eye level.\n\n The next one is a fake Instagram post showing the Sierra Heights wolf mascot tripping over its own shoelaces. The caption: \"Y'all good??? —@PacificCrestOfficial\"\n\n Another one looks like an inspirational quote, but is actually an insult: \"You miss 100% of the shots you take if you're from Sierra Heights.\"\n\n Samantha's muttering curses at tape across the room while slapping up a sign that just reads: \"This locker room brought to you by: Panther Domination™.\"\n\n You catch one that's so stupid that you can't help but laugh: \"NEW STUDY FINDS THAT THE WOLVES HAVE NO OPPOSABLE THUMBS, NO WINS, AND NO HOPE.\"\n\n \"Okay, this one's iconic,\" you say, and Samantha cackles approvingly.\n\n The whole things feels unhinged yet oddly satisfying. You glance at each locker as you finish, imagining the annoyed faces that will greet these messages. It's chaos, sure. But it's not too bad.\n\n You slap your final poster in the center of the last locker and admire your handiwork.\n\n Samantha appears at your side, arms crossed smugly as she surveys what you two have created. \"God, I love team spirit.\" \n\n \"Technically, this might be illegal,\" you mutter.\n\n \"Technically, so is jaywalking. And I do that all the time.\"\n\n You both smirk.\n\n \"Now, let's disappear,\" she says.\n\n \n \"Let's be nice,\" you say. \"I think the mean ones would piss them off.\"\n\n Samantha sighs, dramatic as always. \"A little lame, but alright,\" she says, plucking the cuter stacks of signs from her folder. She splits them in half, then slides them into your hands. \"We'll go with the feel-good propaganda, I guess. You've got a soft heart, [name]. It's gross.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but the truth is, you don't really want to make enemies tonight. Just a little fun, nothing cruel. The Wolves can handle some Pacific Crest school spirit without needing therapy afterward.\n\n You both slip through the side doors of the football building and creep into the visiting locker room. It smells like bleach, faint sweat, and mop water. Not exactly great. The overhead lights are off, but just enough sunlight filters through the high frosted windows to see by. Lockers line the walls, most of them closed, their surfaces scratched and dented from seasons of visiting teams passing through.\n\n Samantha pulls a roll of tape from her pocket, tears off a piece with her teeth, and slaps the first sign on the back of the door: a cartoon of a panther smiling with the caption: \"Thx for the win <3 Pacific Crest.\"\n\n \"Here.\" She hands you the tape. \"Divide and conquer. Let's show these wolves the power of passive-aggressiveness.\"\n\n You grin and get to work, starting at the row of lockers on the left. You peel off strips of tape and post the signs on the metal doors. Each one makes you smile.\n\n One has a cute chibi panther-girl holding a bouquet of flowers, saying: \"Good luck tonight! But not too much!\"\n\n Another poster shows a scoreboard, 21-17 in favor of Pacific Crest, with the caption: \"Just an example! Manifestation is key!\"\n\n You stick that one right in the center of a locker and step back to admire it.\n\n A third one reads: \"Remember: It's not whether you win or lose... it's whether you get absolutely obliterated by the Panthers.\"\n\n From across the room, you hear Samantha snort. \"That one's funny,\" she mutters.\n\n You slap on another one with cheerful bubble letters: \"Believe in yourselves! Just maybe... less than us.\"\n\n Locker by locker, the room transforms into a weird shrine of supportive (but slightly smug) Panther energy. It'd make you laugh if you saw it in your locker. It's enough sass to feel challenged, but sweet enough not to make anyone angry.\n\n Eventually, Samantha straightens up and takes a look around. \"Okay, this is weirdly wholesome,\" she mutters. \"I feel like we just complimented them into submission.\"\n\n \"Better than starting a brawl.\"\n\n \"Debatable,\" she replies with a wink.\n \n\n[Choice: Watch their reactions]",

They're tall, bulky guys in matching varsity jackets and sneakers. Their voices bounce off the walls of the concrete tunnel, loud and casual.\n\n \n \"Woah. What the hell is this?\"\n\n The first voice is loud and sharp with confusion.\n\n You exchange a glance with Samantha and see that the beginning of a grin is curling at the edges of her mouth.\n\n More footsteps enter the room, and then come the voices.\n\n \"Bro. Look at this.\"\n\n A brief silence, and then someone starts reading out loud:\n\n \"You've entered Panther Territory. Wipe your paws before you embarrass yourselves.\"\n\n There's a pause before a guy says, \"Whoever did this is fucking savage.\"\n\n Laughter erupts as people clap their hands and let out low whistles.\n\n \"These guys have too much time on their hands, man. I respect it.\"\n\n Another voice adds, \"They waged psychological warfare on us. Damn.\"\n\n You can here the distinct crinkle of paper being peeled off a locker, followed by a short chuckle. \"I'm keepin' this one.\"\n\n Samantha nudges your ribs with the back of your hand, smug as hell. You glance over to see her absolutely beaming, trying not to burst into laughter. She leans over just enough to whisper, \"I told you I cooked with these.\"\n\n \"They're not even mad,\" you whisper back.\n\n \"They don't have to be.\"\n\n Back in the locker room, the chatter continues as the wolves keep reading off signs and bursting into laughter.\n\n \"They got jokes. Gonna be real awkward when they lose tonight, though.\"\n\n Samantha grabs your wrist and pulls you into a quiet jog, darting away from the locker room. You follow her, adrenaline still buzzing, barely able to hold back your laughter.\n\n \"Operation Three: Locker Room Loyalty Crisis has been executed flawlessly.\"\n\n You grin back, heart racing.\n\n \n The first guy to enter stops short. \"Woah.\"\n\n There's a pause. \"Yo, what the hell is this?\"\n\n Another player laughs. \"Dude, they're posters or something. Friendly, though.\"\n\n A guy reads one aloud: \"Win or lose, you've made it this far. Now don't trip in front of the Panthers.\"\n\n \"Okay, that's kinda funny,\" another admits.\n\n There's a ripple of amusement as they move deeper into the locker room, reading signs as they go.\n\n \"Your mascot may be a wolf, but tonight you're underdog material. Make it count.\"\n\n \"That's savage,\" one guy laughs. \"But respectfully so.\"\n\n \"Bro, these Pacific Crest people are unhinged. Who the hell has the time to come in and do all this?\"\n\n \"Someone with too much school spirit,\" another answers. \"I can't even be mad. They got jokes.\"\n\n A deeper voice chimes in. \"Now we have to win. Can't let them think we're gonna fold because of some arts and crafts.\"\n\n That gets a round of cheers as they get fired up.\n\n \"I don't know if we just messed up or not,\" Samantha whispers.\n\n You smirk. \"Maybe they're just playing it off. Deep down, they're probably really scared.\"\n\n \"Terrified of positive reinforcement.\"\n\n And before you can say anything else, she grabs your wrist and pulls you up, both of you breaking into a quiet jog.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Velocity Lanes is loud, chaotic, and practically humming with retro energy. The linoleum floors are cracked, the neon signs flicker on and off, and the pins smash down like bones. You're barely three steps inside before the poor college guy behind the counter, eyes heavy with regret and existential dread, peeks up from his phone.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" he mutters. \"Not a team.\"\n\nBut it's too late. You're already inside, and behind you is a swarm of sweaty football players and excited cheerleaders pouring into the alley. They're laughing, yelling, and elbowing each other.\n\nThen, from the far side of the snack bar, a voice cuts through the noise.\n\n\"Ahh!\"\n\nHead turns.\n\nOut strides a man with a sweeping, theatrical gait. He's barrel-chested, wearing a black shirt with a pattern of random shapes, and sporting eyebrows so massive they cast their own shadows. His grin could split brick. His accent is thick, proud, and unmistakably Balkan.\n\n\"Look at this! Look at this!\" he shouts, hands spread wide like he's greeting royalty. \"Is miracle! Is raining Panthers in here, eh?\"\n\nThe college kid sighs. \"Roman...\"\n\n\"Shh.\" Roman raises a finger in the air. \"Tonight, I smell prosperity!\"\n\nHe marches up to your group like a general greeting his troops. \"Welcome, welcome, my beautiful American children! I am Roman, king of Velocity Lanes!\" He sweeps an exaggerated bow. \"You come to bowl? Of course you come to bowl! What else what you do with such strong arms and legs?\"\n\nTori claps. \"I love him already.\"\n\nJessica looks concerned. \"Um, we were thinking ten—\"\n\n\"Ten lanes?\" Roman interrupts. \"You get twelve! Because I am feeling generous tonight. And also, you will pay. Yes?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, we're paying,\" Luke assures him.\n\nRoman spins on him. \"You! You look like you eat many nachos, you football man with big arms. You bring many friends. You will spend money. I will not ask questions about your diet.\"\n\n\"Yup, that's me!\" Luke beams.\n\nRoman claps him on the shoulder. \"Very good. You bowl lucky tonight, Nacho Boy.\"\n\nThen Roman throws his arms out again. \"Tonight was slow night, but now! Look! I have football champions, cheerleaders, sparkles, testosterone, mystery! We will make history, eh? You will laugh, you will scream, you will maybe cry. But mostly, you will bowl!\"\n\nHe gestures dramatically toward the ancient scoring computers. \"Lanes await you. Shoes are over there. Do not lie about your size. I will know.\"\n\nAs your group starts drifting off in all directions, Roman leans in conspiratorially and adds to no one in particular, \"Lane 5 is haunted. Do not send any good players there.\"\n\nThen her marches away, muttering something in Serbian under his breath and grabbing a mop like it's a battle axe.\n\nYou glance at Jessica, who is just standing there with her mouth slightly open. \"Well, he's intense.\"\n\n\"He's amazing,\" Tori says reverently.\n\n\"Can we bowl now?\" Luke shouts from halfway down the lane. \"I'm gonna roll a strike!\"\n\nYou shake your head, laughing, and head to change into bowling shoes.

Someone shouts they're getting a cheese platter. Someone else is already trading shoes two sizes too big. Roman is parading around like a victorious war general, cheering in Serbian every time someone lands a strike.\n\nYou take a slow breath, just watching it all for a moment, trying to decide where to drift.\n\nJessica and Luke are already claiming a lane. Luke's practically vibrating with excitement as he grabs a bright orange bowling ball. Jessica's fiddling with her shoes calmly, looking much more collected now than she did before the game. There's still a gleam in her eyes as she glances at the scoring computer though, clearly wanting to win. They're an odd duo, but it somehow works. Luke and Jessica's energy bouncing off each other like chaotic particles.\n\n\"Get over here,\" Jessica says, waving over at you.\n\n \n \"Hey, uh, cheerleader!\" Luke waves with both arms, nearly dropping the ball on his foot. \"You better join us!

Tori already made a crown out of napkins and is wearing it proudly, announcing herself as \"Queen of Lane 11.\" Ashley sits like royalty herself, legs crossed, sipping on something pink. Mia's smirking as she slowly lines up a shot, pretending she's not taking it seriously. However, you know her well enough now to know she definitely is.\n\n\"Gutterball incoming,\" Tori teases, right as Mia releases her shot.\n\nThe ball rolls smooth and straight before nailing a strike.\n\nTori gasps in betrayal. Ashley raises one eyebrow in approval. Mia just shrugs. \"Pure skill,\" she says smugly, catching your eye and tossing you a wink. \"Come sit with the cool girls, [name].\"\n\nFinally, there's Jordan, sitting alone at the bar.

Sneakers scrape on the floor, someone carrying an empty pizza tray, another person who's stolen the bowling shoes. You step out with them, flushed with warmth and noise and a whirlwind of memories.\n\nLuke and a couple of the football guys are tossing a balled-up napkin back and forth like it's a football. Tori's trying to convince Ashley and Mia to come to a diner for desert. Jordan lingers near the edge of the crowd, quietly talking to someone.

The chaos of the night pulses around you, but your eyes land on the pair you've chosen to join: Jessica and Luke.\n\nLuke, sitting on the couch, is in the middle of his story. His arms are wide, and he gestures with so much energy that he makes a half-full soda cup teeter on the edge of the table.\n\n\"—and then I curved it, right?\" he's saying, mimicking an exaggerated spin with his whole torso. \"BAM! Clean strike. Everyone went wild. Coach tried to high-five me and missed. I was unstoppable.\"\n\nJessica leans back, a soda can in her hand, one brow arched with skeptical amusement. \"Oh really?\" she says. \"Unstoppable?\"\n\nLuke beams like he's already won the game. \"I'm telling you. King of the lanes. They used to call me something. What was it again? Bowling... Beast?\"\n\n\"Pretty sure no one's ever called you that,\" Jessica says, smirking.\n\nHe pouts. \"Not to my face, maybe. But the vibe was there.\"\n\n \n You finally reach them, and Luke perks up. \"Yo! [name]!\" He scoots over to make room on the bench. \"Perfect timing. You're about to witness greatness. Jessica here thinks I'm all talk.\"\n\n Jessica shrugs. \"I just said I wanted to see it for myself.\"\n\n Luke turns to you, a serious expression on his face. \"[name]. My dude. My trusted companion. My rock in times of doubt. You believe in me, right?\"\n\n His eyes are wide and hopeful as he waggles his brows for dramatic effect.\n\n Do you believe in him?\n\n \n You finally reach them, and Luke perks up. \"Oh hey, you're one of the new cheer girls, right?\" he says, pointing a finger in your vague direction like it might jog his own memory. \"I've never seen you at school before, but hey, welcome to the epicenter of athletic excellence.\"\n\n Jessica rolls her eyes. \"He means the lane where he's about to embarrass himself.\"\n\n \"Wow. Harsh. Untrue. Unwarranted.\" Luke turns to you, suddenly very serious. \"Alright. You've just walked into greatness. And you, mysterious cheerleader, get to witness it firsthand.\"\n\n He steps a little closer, lowering his voice like he's letting you in on a secret. \"Jessica doesn't believe in me. She thinks I'm all talk. But I'm not. I'm the real deal.\"\n\n Jessica raises a brow but says nothing, letting him dig his own hole.\n\n \"So, do you believe in me?\" he asks you. \"You think I've got this?\"\n \n\n[Choice: I believe in you]\n[Choice: Absolutely not]",

      "text": "\"I believe in you,\" you say, smirking.\n\n Luke straightens and a wide grin appears on his face. \"You hear that?\" he says, turning dramatically toward Jessica. \"I have believers. I have fans. I have faithful companions who recognize greatness when they see it.\"\n\n Jessica raises an eyebrow. \"Okay, okay,\" she says dryly. \"We'll see how it actually goes.\"\n\n \"You'll regret doubting me, Jessica,\" Luke declares. \"Once I start getting scholarship offers for bowling, it's game over.\"\n\n You chuckle. \"Is that a thing?\"\n\n \"It should be,\" Luke replies confidently, still riding the high. \"And if it's not, it will be. For me. I'm gonna revolutionize the sport.\"\n\n \"You can't even revolutionize your footwork, Luke,\" Jessica mutters.\n\n \"Ouch,\" Luke comments. He gets up, and tightens his grip on the ball. \"This one's for all my doubters. For the haters. For Jessica.\"\n\n \"I'm honored,\" she deadpans.\n\n \n \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n You say it without hesitation, arms folded, gaze steady. Luke freezes, his grin faltering for a half-second. That's just long enough for Jessica to let out a sharp laugh and jab her thumb in your direction.\n\n \"Damn,\" she says, smiling. \"I thought you were smart.\"\n\n \"That is being smart!\" Luke says. \"When I get a strike, you're gonna eat your words, Jessica. You'll all be like, 'Wow, Luke, I was so wrong about you.' And I'll be like, 'Yes. Yes you were.'\"\n\n Jessica just rolls her eyes.\n\n \"So are you saying that failure just makes your narrative stronger?\" you ask, raising a brow.\n\n \"Exactly!\" Luke declares, like it's the most obvious thing in the world. \"Every sports movie has this moment, right? Everyone doubts the guy. The music swells. He looks deep inside himself. Then he does it. Standing ovation. The girl falls in love with him. Fireworks, probably.\"\n\n \"Are you okay?\" you ask, biting back a smile.\n\n He waves a hand. \"Don't ruin this. I'm building tension.\"\n\n You glance sideways at Jessica, who's now pretending to inspect her nails. \"You gonna say anything?\"\n\n \"Oh, I'm enjoying this,\" she says with a little smirk. \"It's like watching someone hype themselves up for a disaster.\"\n\n Luke shoots her a look, then points at the lane like it's a challenge issued by destiny itself. \"Watch and learn,\" he says dramatically, reaching for the ball. He squares his shoulders and sticks his tongue out in focus.\n \n\nYou and Jessica both lean forward instinctively, the air around you thick with the kind of ridiculous suspense that only Luke could generate.\n\nAnd then he starts his approach.\n\nThe bowling ball leaves Luke's hand like a cannonball. For a split second, it looks impressive. His arm follows through with a dramatic flair, and you can hear him whisper \"strike\" under his breath.\n\nBut then... it goes up.\n\nNot forward. Not even diagonally.\n\nStraight. Up.\n\nThere's a gasp as the bowling ball soars like a meteor, spinning awkwardly through the air. It smashes into the massive LCD scoreboard above the lanes with a deafening CRACK.\n\nTime freezes.\n\nFor a moment, nothing happens. Then the screen flashes violently before erupting into chaos. The lane display animation, which was supposed to show a goofy cartoon of a bowling pin riding a missile, instead starts stuttering, glitching wildly. The pin's face morphs and loops, its smile melting into a demonic grin. Distorted bowling alley sound effects layer and overlap like it's haunted.\n\n\"SPARE! SPARE! STRIKESTRIKESTRIKE!\"\n\nJessica stares at the cracked screen with a blank expression. Then she slowly turns to Luke.\n\n\"Wow,\" she says. \"Really proved me wrong.\"\n\nLuke, still frozen mid-pose, lowers his hand like he's just realized he's fucked up. \"Uh...\"\n\nAnd then—\n\n\"NOOOOOOOOO!\"\n\nRoman appears from behind the counter and rushes over. His apron flaps behind him and horror is etched into his face. His voice echoes through the alley like thunder:\n\n\"MY BABY! MY BEAUTIFUL BABY! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?\"\n\nHe drops to his knees in front of the flickering screen, hands raised to the heavens. \"She was so young! Only twenty years old! No more warranty!\"\n\nLuke backs away slowly. \"Okay, so I might have—\"\n\nRoman's head snaps toward him.\n\n\"You! Strong man! Too strong! Too much love in arm! You throw like angry god!\"\n\n\"I'll pay for it,\" Luke says quickly, hands up in surrender. \"I swear! Just send me the bill—\"\n\n\"Bill? Pah!\" Roman scoffs. \"You think money replace love? Can buy memories? No! But still, yes, I take money. Much money.\"\n\nJessica is biting back laughter so hard her shoulders are shaking. You're honestly not far behind.\n\nRoman rises to his feet and brushes imaginary dust from his apron. \"You! All of you! no more throwing ball into sky! This is bowling, not basketball!\"\n\nLuke just nods solemnly. \"Understood, sir.\"\n\nRoman storms off, muttering to himself in Serbian, something about disrespect and silicone chips and the youth of today. The busted screen continues to glitch, now displaying a warped \"CONGRATULATIONS\" banner over a melting smiley face.\n\nLuke turns back to you. \"So... do you think that counts as a strike?\"\n\nJessica covers her mouth, but the snort escapes anyway.\n\nAnd you?\n\n \n You're not sure why you believed in him.\n\n \n You're just glad you didn't decide to believe in him.\n \n\n[Choice: Watch Luke]",

      "text": "Luke's bowling career ends with a busted screen, a panicked apology, and Roman sobbing over the shattered remains of what he called his \"beautiful baby.\" The three of you retreat from the lane, deciding it's safer to just hang out on the couch instead.\n\n Now, Luke sits across from you, drink in hand, slouched back like he's trying to play it cool. It might've worked if his eyes weren't darting toward you every few seconds, like he's trying to check that you're still real. You sip from your ridiculous drink glass, pretending not to notice how pink the tips of his ears are.\n\n Jessica's off to the side, scrolling through her phone, but every now and then, she glances up with a smirk.\n\n Luke exhales hard through his nose. \"So, uh,\" he says, barely meeting your eyes. \"You having fun tonight?\"\n\n You nod slowly, watching him squirm a little. \"Yeah. More than I expected to, honestly.\"\n\n \"Cool. Cool.\" He takes a long sip of soda like it's going to shield him. \"You, uh... you're good at cheering. You've got the whole... thing going on. And jumps. And the yelling.\"\n\n You blink. \"Thanks?\"\n\n He nods rapidly. \"I mean, I really do mean it. I just didn't think you'd actually go through with it. You're still here and you're still doing it. And, uh—\"\n\n Jessica leans forward just enough to interject, dry as ever. \"You gonna say [name] is pretty next, or...?\"\n\n Luke chokes. \"What? No, I mean, shut up, Jessica.\"\n\n You just raise an eyebrow at him, the corner of your mouth twitching.\n\n He groans and drags his hand down his face. \"Look, it's just weird, okay? You're still my best friend. But now you're... you. And that's not bad, it's just...\" He flounders for a second, searching for a word. \"New. It's new.\"\n\n \"New how?\" you ask, humming.\n\n He doesn't answer right away. His leg bounces under the table, and he's chewing the inside of his cheek like he's worried the wrong answer might explode. \"It's like... I've always had this mental picture of you, and now I'm updating it. I guess I'm still figuring it out.\"\n\n Jessica snorts, still not looking up. \"Translation: 'I'm confused because my best friend's hot now.'\"\n\n Luke groans.\n\n You let the silence settle, warm and buzzing with tension. Luke clears his throat, doing his best to break it. \"Just, uh... for the record, you pull it off. All of it. The cheer stuff. The look. It suits you.\"\n\n You get the feeling he's not just talking about your outfit.\n\n \n The three of you eventually give up on bowling.\n\n The busted screen is still glitching like it's trying to learn new languages, and Roman has finally stopped wailing. You're now back on the long couch behind the lane. Jessica's strolling through her phone and Luke... very much not looking at you. Which, of course, means he keeps glancing at you and then turning away the second you look back.\n\n He scratches the back of his neck, clearing his throat. \"Sooo... sorry about that. Not exactly the strike I promised.\"\n\n \"Understatement of the year,\" Jessica says, snorting.\n\n Luke grins sheepishly and leans back, his arm stretched along the top of the couch. His eyes dart toward you again, just a flicker, but when they land on your face, he grins.\n\n \"Uh... hey,\" he says, very eloquently.\n\n \"Hey,\" you reply, playing it cool.\n\n \"You, uh...\" He gestures vaguely at you. \"You bowl?\"\n\n You blink. \"I mean, we're literally at a bowling alley.\"\n\n \"No, I meant, like, do you bowl well?\" He shifts in his seat, his knee bouncing slightly. \"Like, outside of this. Regularly.\"\n\n Jessica doesn't even glance up. \"Oh my God. Luke.\"\n\n \"What?\" he says quickly. \"I'm just making conversation.\"\n\n \"You're sweating.\"\n\n \"I'm not sweating,\" he lies, absolutely sweating.\n\n You bite back a smile. Luke's never been subtle about his type, and you know he's got a thing for cute Asian girls. You can practically see the gears in his brain struggling to connect the dots. To him, you're just a very pretty, very unfamiliar girl who somehow knows Jessica and is way too cool to be this close to him on a Friday night.\n\n He leans forward, elbows on his knees, trying for a casual tone. \"So, uh. You from around here? I mean, obviously, I guess, since you're at our school, but, like, have we met?\"\n\n You raise an eyebrow. \"You don't recognize me?\"\n\n His eyes widen for half a second in panic. \"No! I mean, maybe? I meet a lot of people! Kind of? I'd remember you though. Wait, but not like—\"\n\n Jessica looks up with a smirk. \"Luke,\" she says, \"you're spiraling.\"\n\n \"I'm not spiraling,\" Luke mutters, but his voice cracks halfway through, and he swallows hard like it betrayed him. He clears his throat. \"Anyway. You, uh, seem cool.\"\n\n You blink. \"Thanks?\"\n\n \"And... I like your hair. I mean. It's cool. Very, uh. Shiny.\"\n\n Jessica lets out a single sharp laugh and immediately turns it into a fake cough.\n\n Luke's ears are pink.\n\n You glance at him again, and his knee is still bouncing. He doesn't know who you are. He doesn't realize he's hitting on his best friend. And part of you finds that hilarious. The other part, though, is kind of curious what would happen if you leaned into it.\n \n\n[Choice: Flirt back]\n[Choice: Flirt just to mess with him]\n[Choice: Leave him alone]",

      "text": "Luke is quiet now. He's got a half-smile he always wears when he's unsure but curious, a kind of soft confusion curling at the edges of his mouth. You let the silence settle for just a beat longer, before leaning in a little. Just enough that your face is near his. Just enough to make it obvious you meant to do it.\n\n \"Y'know,\" you say. \"I really do like being around you.\"\n\n Luke blinks. His head turns slightly, like he's not sure he heard you right. \"What?\"\n\n You shrug one shoulder, gaze playful but warmer now. \"You're fun. You're sweet. And you're kind of dumb sometimes, but in a way that makes people feel safer around you. It's... nice.\"\n\n He's blinking again. His mouth is slightly open and words form halfway in his mouth before dying on his tongue.\n\n Jessica picks up on the shift instantly. She raises an eyebrow and leans back, arms folded, watching you both like someone tuning in to a particularly good drama. \"Damn,\" she says under her breath, \"your dream might just come true, Luke.\"\n\n Luke turns red.\n\n \"Jessica—\" he starts, voice cracking.\n\n \"No, go on ahead,\" she interrupts with a grin. \"Don't let me stop you. Keep going, Romeo.\"\n\n He groans and drops his face into his hands. \"I'm gonna die.\"\n\n \"C'mon,\" you say, laughing softly. \"You're not that bad at taking a compliment.\"\n\n \"I just didn't expect—\" He cuts himself off and peeks at you through his fingers. \"Wait, are you serious right now?\"\n\n You don't answer right away. You just meet his eyes and give a small nod.\n\n His expression wavers between baffled and maybe a little hopeful. You see the exact moment something shifts behind his eyes.\n\n \"You're dangerous when you mean it,\" he says quietly.\n\n \"Good thing you know how to deal with it,\" you say, smirking.\n\n Jessica lets out a dramatic sigh and flops sideways across the bench. \"Okay, but seriously, if you two start kissing I'm walking out.\"\n\n You and Luke both laugh, and the moment softens, but it doesn't vanish. The warmth lingers between you. It's new, different, and maybe even real.\n\n \n \n Luke is still kind of pink in the face, sipping his soda like it'll cool down whatever weird heat is rising up his neck. He's trying to act normal and keep it together, but you can see the flickers of something flustered bubbling just beneath the surface.\n\n And, well, you can't resist.\n\n You scoot closer, just enough that your face is right in front of his, and tilt your head at him with a smile that's all innocent mischief.\n\n \"Y'know,\" you say, voice syrupy sweet, \"you're really cute when you get all flustered.\"\n\n Luke visibly freezes. Soda halfway to his mouth. Eyes darting to you like you just short-circuited something in his brain.\n\n \"W-What?\" he stammers.\n\n You rest your chin in your hand, legs swinging a little beneath the bench like you haven't just completely wrecked the poor guy's mental processor. \"Just saying. You get all red and lose your usual confidence. It's kinda adorable.\"\n\n Jessica turns, clearly catching the shift in tone. \"Oh my God,\" she murmurs, barely holding back a laugh.\n\n \"I—I am not flustered,\" Luke says, helpless and flustered.\n\n You widen your eyes in mock surprise. \"You're not? Oh no, then I must've imagined all that stammering. Silly me.\"\n\n \"I'm not stammering,\" Luke protests, and it's an immediate lie because he stammers the word stammering. He slaps his hand over his face. \"This is a setup.\"\n\n You just giggle wickedly. You are way too pleased with yourself. \"Maybe a little.\"\n\n Jessica actually bursts our laughing now. She leans back against the bench and fans herself dramatically. \"This is so much better than the bowling.\"\n\n Luke groans. He drops his head into his hands. \"I knew it. I knew you were messing with me.\"\n\n \"I was just trolling, sorry,\" you say, chuckling. \"Not actually interested.\"\n\n He peeks through his fingers, still pink. \"You suck.\"\n\n Jessica laughs even harder at that, wiping at the corners of her eyes. \"You fell for it so hard.\"\n\n \"I didn't fall for anything,\" Luke mutters, but he's doing that thing where he can't stop smiling even though he's trying to act mad about it.\n\n You stretch your legs out in front of you and lean back with a satisfied sigh, basking in the chaos. You'll play nice for a bit now.\n\n Maybe.\n\n \n Luke's compliment lingers in the air a moment longer than either of you are ready for.\n\n He looks away first.\n\n You shift in your seat, letting the silence settle. You could lean in, tease him a little, chase that flustered expression until he trips over himself again. It'd be easy. Almost too easy. And part of you is tempted to maybe test the waters and see what would happen if you nudged the moment off balance.\n\n But you don't.\n\n You just offer a small, quiet smile. Nothing loaded. Nothing more than a gesture of understanding and appreciation. You don't say anything back and just let it be. Luke seems relieved, though he covers it up with a sip of his soda and a muttered, \"Yeah, whatever,\" like he didn't just bare a piece of himself out loud.\n\n Jessica watches all of this from over her phone with a subtle arch of one brow, lips twitching in amusement. But to her credit, she doesn't say a word. Just goes back to scrolling like she wasn't tracking every beat of the interaction.\n\n \"So, uh, I think I'm banned from bowling here now,\" Luke murmurs, clearing his throat. \"Roman keeps staring at me like I murdered his dog.\"\n\n You glance over at Roman, who's leaned over the counter, glaring at Luke. \"I mean, you did throw a ball at his child,\" you say, laughing.\n\n \"It was a TV,\" he protests weakly, but the blush creeping back up his neck says he knows you're right.\n\n The conversation veers off after that. Safer territory. Topics like food court hot dogs, whether or not anyone's actually finished a full large milkshake from Clancy's is, and how many more games until everyone has to go.\n\n Whatever tension was there a minute ago softens into something easier, something familiar. You don't need to define anything. It's okay to keep things the way they are.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "Bowling Hangout — Jordan Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \nYou make your way toward the neon-lit bar tucked into the corner of Velocity Lanes, navigating around a few stray bowling balls and a couple of football players crowding the vending machine. At the bar, Jordan sits alone on a tall stool, hunched slightly with his elbows on the counter. He's in his usual outfit, varsity jacket sleeves pushed up just enough to show the faint outline of his forearms. They're still tense, probably from the game. His dark eyes are fixed on the glass in front of him, and he doesn't flinch as Roman gestures wildly behind the counter.\n\n\"You must understand,\" Roman is saying, eyes wide with passion. \"This is not just alley. This is temple of strikes! People come here to make memories! To win love! To maybe meet nice girl and—\"\n\nJordan lifts his glass and takes a slow sip.\n\n\"...Or maybe just to unwind,\" Roman finished, eyeing him for a reaction that doesn't come. \"Yes. Of course. You are man of mystery. Like spy. I respect this.\"\n\nYou slide onto the stool next to him. Jordan glances over at you, his eyes a little wide, like he hadn't noticed you walk up.\n\n\"Hey,\" you say, then tilt your head toward his drink. The amber liquid in the short glass gleams beneath the bar lights. \"Is that... beer?\"\n\nJordan blinks, then chuckles. \"No. It's tea.\"\n\nYou pause, eyes narrowing slightly. \"That's... really convincing tea.\"\n\n\"It's in a whiskey glass,\" he mutters, pushing the drink away half an inch. \"Roman said it adds atmosphere.\"\n\n\"Right,\" you reply, trying not to laugh. \"Because nothing says 'refreshing tea' like pretending to be an underage drinker.\"\n\nJordan sighs and rubs the back of his neck. \"I just wanted something warm and quiet.\"\n\n\"It does look nice,\" you say, letting your gaze linger on the drink.\n\n\"Truth be told, I was hoping it'd make people stop talking to me,\" Jordan admits, a little dryly.\n\nRoman, who's only been pretending to wipe a glass, suddenly leans in with a wink. \"But not this one, yes?\" he says, nodding toward you. \"She seems to be exception.\"\n\nJordan doesn't answer that one. He just gives Roman a flat look, which is met with an exaggerated bow before Roman shuffles off to terrorize someone else.\n\nThe moment stretches comfortably. The noise of the bowling alley thrums behind you. Pins crash, someone shouts about a strike, and Tori's unmistakable laugh floating from a lane. You glance sideways at Jordan.\n\n \n His eyes are still on his drink, but he hasn't taken a sip in a while. There's a rare softness in the way he holds himself now, like the tension that usually hangs from his shoulders has finally loosened a bit.\n\n \"So, why'd you come?\" you start, trying to keep your voice light.\n\n Jordan blinks and glances at you. \"To the party?\"\n\n You nod. \"You didn't seem all that interested earlier. You literally tried to sneak off.\"\n\n He huffs through his nose, like he doesn't want to admit the truth but also doesn't have the energy to lie. \"Yeah, well... I was curious.\"\n\n You tilt your head. \"Curious?\"\n\n \"About you,\" he says bluntly. Then realizing how that sounds, he looks away and frowns. \"I mean, not like that. Just, I've been thinking since last week.\"\n\n Your heartbeat skips just a little. You know exactly what he's talking about. You told him the truth, that the new girl on the cheer squad was actually you. He didn't really seem to care back then. But now, here he is, at a party he clearly didn't plan to attend.\n\n \"I didn't get it,\" Jordan continues. \"Still kind of don't. Why you signed up. Why you'd even want to.\"\n\n You watch his profile for a moment. His jaw's tense, but not closed-off the way it usually is. There's something sincere in the way he's looking at the bar, like the words are hard to say but worth saying anyway.\n\n \"It's been stuck in my head, so I figured I should make an attempt to understand it better,\" Jordan says.\n\n You blink. \"Understand what?\"\n\n \"You,\" he says simply. \"The way you're changing. The way you carry yourself now. It's different, but not bad. Just different.\" He frowns like the words taste weird in his mouth. \"I've never seen someone do that before. Decide to just... become someone new. Or maybe become more of who they were all along.\"\n\n You're not sure what to say to that. Jordan doesn't talk like this often, if ever. The usual version of him is cold and distant. But here, now, his words are quiet and careful.\n\n Then he turns fully to you, finally meeting your gaze. \"So I've gotta ask, why'd you really do it? The cheerleading thing. Was it just for fun? Or was it something else.\"\n\n The noise of the bowling alley fades around you. The moment is real, personal, and waiting for your answer.\n\n \n You glance at Jordan, who's seated beside you at the bar, taking a slow sip of his drink. Still not beer. Still tea. Still suspiciously amber-colored.\n\n \"So, why'd you end up coming anyway?\" you ask casually, nudging your elbow. \"Didn't seem like your thing.\"\n\n Jordan doesn't look at you right away. He stares down into his drink for a second, then finally lifts his eyes.\n\n \"I was curious,\" he says.\n\n You blink. \"About the party?\"\n\n \"No,\" he says, turning to you more fully. \"About why you're a cheerleader.\"\n\n The words hit you like a cold splash of water. You freeze for just a second too long, your mouth halfway open before you force a small laugh.\n\n \"What?\" You try to tilt your head innocently. \"Me? What do you mean?\"\n\n Jordan doesn't even blink. \"You might've fooled everyone else. But not me.\"\n\n Your heart thuds in your chest, and this time, your laugh comes out a little more forced. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n \"I know it's you, [name].\"\n\n The air stills a little.\n\n Jordan's tone hasn't changed, but there's something weighty beneath it. He's not teasing you, not bluffing. Just stating a fact.\n\n \"I noticed after the first game,\" he says. \"You thought you were slick, but you've got the same height. Same voice. Same gait. Not to mention we don't have many Asian girls at this school. C'mon.\"\n\n You open your mouth, then close it again. There's no point in denying it anymore.\n\n \"I wasn't going to say anything,\" he continues. \"I figured maybe you had your reasons for keeping it to yourself. But since we're here...\"\n\n He leans forward slightly, resting an elbow on the bar, and for once, the usual guarded edge in his voice softens.\n\n \"Why'd you do it?\"\n\n You glance down at the counter, then back at him. He's watching you intently now. Not pressing. Just waiting.\n\n \"Was it for fun? A dare? Or was it something else?\" he asks, more quietly this time.\n\n The din of the bowling alley hums around you, but it might as well be a mile away. In this moment, it's just you and him.\n \n\n[Choice: I just wanted to]\n[Choice: I did it as a favor to Jessica]",

The buzz of pins, yelling, and Roman's booming laugh from somewhere off to the side all fade under the weight of your silence.\n\n You glance down at the bar top, fingers drumming on the table. You could deflect. Joke. Say it was a dare or a bet or just something stupid. But somehow, with Jordan watching you like that, it feels wrong not to answer honestly.\n\n So you take a breath. Let it out. And say, quietly but clearly, \"I did it because I wanted to.\"\n\n Jordan raises an eyebrow, just slightly. \"Yeah?\"\n\n \"Yeah.\" You glance over at him, searching for the right words. \"I didn't think I'd... I mean, I never expected to enjoy it. Not really. But once I was out there—moving with everyone, hearing the crowd, being part of it—it felt...\" You pause, trying to untangle the knot of feelings that's been building for weeks. \"It felt right. Not just the cheering. The outfit, the energy, the way people saw me.\"\n\n Jordan doesn't speak. Just listens.\n\n You shift a little on your stool. \"I still don't know what it means,\" you admit. \"I don't know if I'm... you know. Whatever. I'm not trying to pretend I have it figured out. But when I'm with the squad, when I'm in uniform and moving in sync and smiling without having to fake it, it's like something clicks. Like it's okay to not know. Like it's okay to just be.\"\n\n Jordan's eyes soften. He nods slowly, almost imperceptibly.\n\n You continue, your voice steadier now. \"I've spent so much of my life just going along with what I thought I was supposed to do. Supposed to be. This is the first thing I've done for myself. Just because it made me feel... good. Like me.\"\n\n For a while, Jordan doesn't say anything. He looks away, nodding once, as if absorbing it all.\n\n Finally, he murmurs, \"That makes sense.\"\n\n \"It does?\" you ask, blinking.\n\n \"Yeah.\" His tone is low, but honest. \"You don't have to explain more than that. Wanting to feel like yourself? That's enough.\"\n\n You don't realize how tense you were until your shoulders relax.\n\n He leans back slightly, watching you with a kind of quiet curiosity now, the corners of his mouth just barely tilted upward. \"It's good that you did it, then. Even if it took me longer than it should have to figure it out.\"\n\n \"Well, you still figured it out in a few hours,\" you point out. \"Guess I wasn't that convincing, huh?\"\n \n \"No,\" Jordan says. \"You were terrible at hiding it. I don't know how I'm the only one who's figured it out.\"\n\n You laugh again, this time more freely. And when your laughter fades, what's left is a quiet, easy silence.\n\n Somewhere behind you, a cheer goes up as someone bowls a strike. Roman shouts something about destiny. But here, at the bar, the moment stays soft. Real.\n\n \"Thanks,\" you murmur.\n\n \"For what?\"\n\n \"For not making it weird.\"\n\n He shrugs. \"Didn't seem weird to me.\"\n\n And maybe that's the best part.\n\n \n \n \n You glance down at the countertop, fingers drumming on the table. Jordan's question lingers in the air. You let out a breath and lean back slightly, trying to act casual.\n\n \"It wasn't really a big thing,\" you say. \"Jessica needed someone. They were short for the first game of the season, and I happened to be there. So I stepped in.\"\n\n You shrug, like that's all there is to it. No big deal. Just a one-time favor.\n\n Jordan raises an eyebrow, but doesn't interrupt. He gives you space.\n\n \"I figured I should help because she's always been cool with me,\" you continue, your voice a little quieter now. \"She was really nice to me in homeroom. So when she asked, I said yeah. That's all.\"\n\n You expect him to challenge you, maybe. Ask again, press deeper. But he just watches you for a second, then glances back down at his drink.\n\n \"Jessica asked me about it again later,\" you admit. \"I thought it wouldn't be the worst thing to help out once more. They needed someone, and it's not like I was doing anything else. I don't really think of myself as, like, a cheerleader. Or anything. It's just something I did to help out.\"\n\n Jordan turns his head, watching the way your expression tightens slightly when you say that last part. He's just reading you.\n\n You shift in your seat.\n\n \"I guess people assumed it meant something more,\" you murmur. \"But it didn't. Not really. It's just a thing I did. That's it.\"\n\n There's a short pause.\n\n Then, Jordan nods slowly, thoughtful. \"Alright.\"\n\n You blink, surprised.\n\n \"That's fair,\" he says. \"Helping someone out. Doesn't have to mean more than that.\"\n\n It's not the reaction you were expecting. No lectures. No questions about what it 'means' or who you're becoming. Just quiet acceptance. And maybe that's the thing about Jordan. He sees a lot, but he doesn't always feel the need to say it out loud.\n\n You sit there for a while longer, the bowling alley alive around you. The pins crash. Laughter from somewhere in the back. Mia shouting that she totally got a strike when she definitely didn't. Tori arguing over toppings.\n\n You steal a glance at Jordan again. He's watching the lanes, that unreadable calm still settled on his face.\n\n You exhale, feeling... lighter, somehow.\n\n Not everything needs to be figured out tonight.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

It's just the two of you at the bar.\n\n Jordan has a half-finished drink in front of him. You're still not sure whether its tea or something more daring. He seems more relaxed now, his eyes not darting away every other second like they used to.\n\n \"I've been getting emails,\" Jordan says suddenly. \"Calls too.\"\n\n You glance over. \"From recruiters?\"\n\n He nods, but there's a tension. Something tight in his jaw. \"Alabama's been calling. The Crimson Tide. They've been showing a lot of interest.\"\n\n Your eyes widen. \"Wait, seriously? That's huge.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" he says, giving a small laugh. \"Scary huge.\"\n\n You blink. \"Scary? Shouldn't that be a good thing?\"\n\n Jordan looks at you then, and for once, there's no smirk or wall or shrug to deflect it all. \"C'mon,\" he says, voice quieter now, \"you know where my heart's at.\"\n\n You do.\n\n Jordan's not just the team captain or the star quarterback. He's the guy who sits through plays with his eyes glued to the stage, the one who offered to help build set pieces for the upcoming play even though nobody asked. The one who knows more about stage lighting than anyone else on the actual tech crew.\n\n \"My family doesn't really get me,\" he adds, looking down at the condensation on his glass. \"Football's the legacy. Dad played, his dad played. If I told them I didn't want to go to Alabama...\"\n\n He trails off.\n\n \"They'd freak out,\" you finish for him.\n\n He nods, grateful you said it for him. \"Yeah.\"\n\n You nudge your shoulder lightly against his. \"Well, for what it's worth... I think you should do what you actually want to do.\"\n\n \"Thanks,\" Jordan says quietly. He exhales slowly, and it seems like a weight in his shoulder has dropped. \"I'm not good at this stuff. Being honest.\"\n\n \"You're doing fine,\" you say. \"Better than most.\"\n\n The noise of the bowling alley floats back in. A group of football guys howl about someone guttering twice in a row, Tori gasps, and pins crash.\n\n Jordan straightens up, casting you a sideways glance that's somewhere between amused and grateful. \"Alright, no more of this sappy shit,\" he says. \"I'm getting you a drink.\"\n\n He raises his hand to flag down the same exhausted college-aged employee who's been stuck working all night. The guy trudges over with the energy of a man twice his age, towel slung over his shoulder, eyes dead inside.\n\n \"What'll it be?\" Jordan asks, turning to you.\n\n \n \"You ever think about quitting?\" Jordan asks.\n\n You blink. \"Cheerleading?\"\n\n He shrugs, not looking at you. \"Or just... not doing the thing everyone expects you to do.\"\n\n You consider it for a second. \"Sure. I mean, who hasn't?\"\n\n Jordan lets out a low hum. \"I've been getting emails about football. Recruiters from colleges and all that. I'm sure there was a scout at the game today.\"\n\n You nod slowly, trying to follow where this is going.\n\n \"But...\" he pauses, finally glancing your way, \"I don't think I want to do this forever.\"\n\n You tilt your head. \"Then what do you want to do?\"\n\n Jordan actually chuckles. It's a quiet sound, more from the chest than the mouth. \"Now that,\" he says, setting the glass down, \"would be saying too much.\"\n\n You grin. \"You brought it up.\"\n\n He shrugs again. \"Maybe I'll tell you one day.\"\n\n \"Big secret?\"\n\n \"Nah,\" he says simply. He stretches lightly, cracking his neck to the side before glancing down at you. \"C'mon, I'll get you a drink.\"\n\n You blink. \"Uh, I'm good.\"\n\n \"Nope,\" he says firmly, already flagging down the poor overworked employee behind the bar. The guy looks like he'd rather be anywhere else, but trudges over anyway.\n\n \"What'll it be?\" Jordan asks, nudging you. \"Pick your poison.\"\n \n\n[Choice: Water]\n[Choice: Milk]\n[Choice: Orange Juice]\n[Choice: Beer]",

You sure your system can handle that much excitement?\"\n\n You snort. \"Hey, I like to live dangerously.\"\n\n The poor college-aged employee just lets out an exaggerated sigh and lumbers off toward the back. You and Jordan fall into an easy silence. You hear the soft whirr of the soda machine, and the sound of glass.\n\n \"You know, I really wasn't drinking beer earlier,\" Jordan says, lowering his voice.\n\n \"I'm still a little suspicious,\" you say.\n\n He grins. \"Just wait.\"\n\n When the employee returns, he's holding what you think is water. The issue is that it's been poured into a ridiculously tall, delicate champagne glass. A paper cocktail umbrella is on top. It clinks gently as he sets it down in front of you like it's a luxury item.\n\n \"See?\" Jordan points out. \"Told you. They just do this.\"\n\n You blink at the glass, trying not to laugh. \"I guess you're right.\"\n\n You pick it up delicately and take a slow, dramatic sip.\n\n Jordan chuckles under his breath. \"You pull that off way too well,\" he mutters. \"You sure you haven't done some drinking before?\"\n\n \"I'm sure,\" you say, taking another sip.\n \n Water has never tasted so refined.\n\n \n You lean forward against the counter, scanning the drink options. \"I'll take the milk.\"\n\n \"Milk?\" Jordan asks, turning to you like he's not sure he heard you right.\n\n \"Yup,\" you say, nodding firmly.\n\n A beat.\n\n Jordan squints at you. \"Milk.\"\n\n \"Don't hate,\" you say, resting your chin in your hand and grinning. \"It's good for your bones.\"\n\n Jordan lets out a slow, theatrical sigh, turning back toward the bar like he's disappointed in the youth of today. \"Fell for the propaganda.\"\n\n \"I did not,\" you mutter, groaning.\n\n He raises an eyebrow. \"You totally did.\"\n\n \"Calcium is important,\" you say. \"And besides, milk is versatile. You can drink it. You can put in cereal. You can put it in coffee. It's elite, actually.\"\n\n \"You sound like a weird spokesperson for the dairy industry,\" Jordan says, amusement tugging at his mouth.\n\n You shrug, pleased. \"Someone has to be.\"\n\n The employee returns, looking as exhausted as ever, and sets down your milk in a stemmed glass. There's even a cherry in it for some reason. The glass clinks lightly as he slides it toward you, then trudges off with the defeated gait of someone who stopped caring a long time ago.\n\n You take a long sip. It's delicious.\n\n \n The glass of orange juice arrives with a cheery clink, the surface pulpy and orange. You take it in both hands, grateful for something cold and citrusy after everything tonight.\n\n Jordan glances at it, then huffs a little through his nose. \"Orange juice, huh?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, glancing sideways. \"What, you don't like it?\"\n\n He shrugs, drumming his fingers against the counter. \"Used to.\"\n\n \"Used to?\" you ask.\n\n \"Yeah,\" he replies, rolling his shoulder like he's trying to get something unstuck. \"I swapped to orange Gladiraid a while back. Got tired of the pulp, I think.\"\n\n You smirk and take a long sip of orange juice before answering. \"Isn't that unhealthy?\"\n\n \"Probably,\" Jordan states. \"Tastes good, though.\"\n\n \"You know what, I guess I can't judge,\" you say. \"Orange juice isn't exactly super healthy either.\"\n\n He glances over at you, eyes amused. \"The type you buy at the store is probably, like, 90% sugar.\"\n\n \"Fair,\" you admit, setting the glass down with a soft thunk. \"Still better than soda.\"\n\n \"Debatable,\" Jordan mutters, snorting.\n\n \"Okay, but Gladiraid is basically neon-colored sugar water. You can't even argue with that.\"\n\n \"Exactly,\" he says, not even bothering to defend himself. \"Sometimes you want sugar water. With electrolytes.\"\n\n \"Well, sometimes I want juice,\" you say, grinning. \"With vitamin C.\"\n\n \"That's fair,\" Jordan says, chuckling.\n\n \n \"Can I have a beer?\" you ask.\n\n The employee stares at you with a flat expression from behind the counter.\n\n \"...Beer?\" he repeats.\n\n You nod, trying your best to keep a straight face. \"Yeah. Just one.\"\n\n The guy squints at you. \"Didn't you just get out of a high school homecoming game?\"\n\n \"...Yeah,\" you admit.\n\n He gives you a long, unamused look. \"Yeah, you're not old enough for beer.\"\n\n Before you can say anything else, he turns and walks off, muttering something under his breath about teenagers.\n\n Next to you, Jordan lets out a short bark of laughter. He leans forward on his stool, shaking his head. \"Did you really think you were gonna get away with that?\"\n\n You crack up, the ridiculousness of it finally catching up with you. \"I mean, it was worth a shot.\"\n\n \"You didn't even have a fake ID or anything,\" Jordan says, grinning. \"You just asked.\"\n\n \"Maybe I've got that kind of face,\" you say with a shrug. \"Mature. Responsible. Deserving of beer.\"\n\n \"Yeah, you do not got that kind of face,\" he responds.\n\n \"Ouch,\" you say.\n\n He chuckles again, shaking his head and leaning back. \"Should've gone with milk.\"\n\n \"You would've judged me for that, too,\" you state.\n\n \"Oh, absolutely,\" he says without missing a beat.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Mia, Tori, Ashley, and some other girls occupy the lane like it's a throne room.\n\n\"Look who finally came to the winning lane,\" Mia says the moment you step into view, her voice smooth. She's lounging across the couch, arms draped dramatically behind her head.\n\nAshley tilts her chin in greeting, cool as ever. \"You made the wise choice,\" she says, voice low and dry.\n\nTori waves at you. \"[name]! We were just about to summon you physically. We all closed our eyes and chanted your name, didn't we, Mia?\"\n\nMia rolls her eyes. \"We didn't.\"\n\nAshley tosses a crumped up napkin at her. \"She did.\"\n\nYou can't help but smile. The vibe here is different from the other groups. It feels easy and bright.\n\nTori hops up from her seat, grabs a swirly green bowling ball that looks like it was churned from toxic sludge, and marches up to the lane.\n\n\"Watch and be amazed,\" she declares. \"This ball has chosen me.\"\n\nShe plants her feet in a truly terrible stance, wiggles her fingers, and releases the ball. It wobbles its way down the lane like a drunk puppy, veers wildly toward the edge, and somehow gets seven pins.\n\nEveryone cheers.\n\nTori spins around, arms raised triumphantly. \"Did I not just tell you the ball and I are spiritually linked?\"\n\n\"I hate that it worked,\" Mia mutters.\n\nAshley shrugs. \"Chaos gets results.\"\n\nTori blows a kiss and plops back into her seat. \"Okay, Ash, your turn!\"\n\nAshley rises with the grace of someone who knows she doesn't need to prove anything. She picks up a marbled blue ball and glides to the front. Her form is fluid, unbothered, and confident. When she releases the ball, it rolls clean and straight, knocking down eight pins in a single, crisp hit.\n\n\"Calculated,\" she says, barely reacting.\n\nMia claps twice.\n\nThe other girls go, and a lot of balls end up guttering. Eventually, though, it's your time to shine.\n\n\"Now it's your turn, mystery girl,\" Mia says smugly, looking at you directly.\n\nYou laugh under your breath and grab a ball, feeling the weight of it in your hands. It's heavy and a little awkward to hold, but you steady your fingers in the holes and take a few steps toward the lane.\n\nBehind you, you hear Tori whisper loudly, \"Everyone hush. History's about to be made.\"\n\nAshley adds, \"No pressure or anything.\"\n\nYou glance back at them. \"That is extremely comforting, thank you.\"\n\nMia grins. \"You're welcome.\"\n\nYou step up to the edge of the lane. You bend your knees, square your shoulders, and prepare to let the ball fly.\n\n[Choice: Deliver it!]",

You take a breath, shift your weight, and step forward. The motion is fluid, a little more graceful than expected for someone who's only bowled a handful of times before.\n\n You release the ball with a clean, practiced flick of the wrist, and it glies down the lane like it's on a mission. It's not too fast or too slow. It curves ever so slightly, angling into the pins.\n\n CRACK.\n\n The sound is sharp and satisfying. Pins scatter. Nine go down instantly, the lone survivor wobbling on its base before stubbornly deciding to stay upright.\n\n You blink. \"Huh,\" you say, barely suppressing a grin. \"That felt kinda nice.\"\n\n Behind you, there's a pause. A long stunned silence.\n\n Then—\n\n \"Oh my God,\" Mia says flatly. \"Of course.\"\n\n Tori lets out an exaggerated groan and collapses into her chair like she's just been personally betrayed. \"Why are you good at everything?\"\n\n Ashley squints at the pins, arms folded. \"Nine on your first try? You sure you're not lowkey a professional?\"\n\n You walk back to them, trying to keep a straight face, but a grin is definitely starting to show.\n\n \"I mean, I don't know,\" you say innocently. \"Maybe I'm just naturally gifted.\"\n\n Mia shoots you a sharp look. \"You just stroll into cheerleading, and do a flip. Strolls into bowling and knocks down a whole family of pins. Next you're gonna tell me you have a 4.0 GPA and knit sweaters for orphans on weekends.\"\n\n \"I'm not perfect, though,\" you reply, chuckling. \"I didn't get the last pin.\"\n\n Ashley raises an eyebrow. \"Wow. So humble.\"\n\n Tori throws a handful of popcorn at you. \"Get out of here with your balance and coordination and inner core strength or whatever. Some of us are just trying to live!\"\n\n \"I'm just here to bowl, man,\" you say, throwing your hands up.\n\n \n You steady yourself at the edge of the lane, gripping the ball a little too tight.\n\n It's heavier than you thought it'd be. Awkward and unbalanced, like it's just waiting to slip right out of your fingers. You try to mimic what you've seen the others do, but your arm is stiff, your shoes are too slippery, and your legs numb. Everything just feels a little... off.\n\n You start your approach, taking one step before immediately regretting it. Your pace is weirdly choppy, like your body's forgotten how walking works. You try to salvage it, swinging the ball forward with a bit of momentum, but it ends of slipping early.\n\n Way early.\n\n The ball thuds to the floor with a loud clunk and spins wildly off-course, wobbling toward the left gutter. There's a brief moment where it almost looks like it might veer back toward the center, until it doesn't. It kisses the edge of the lane and drops straight into the gutter with a dull echo.\n\n \"Oh nooo,\" Tori wails like a soap opera actress.\n\n Mia just mutters, \"Tragic.\"\n\n Ashley, to her credit, doesn't laugh. But she does raise one eyebrow. \"You okay there? With your luck, I thought you'd strike.\"\n\n \"That was worse than I expected,\" you say, sighing.\n\n \"Honestly?\" Tori says, grinning as she leans over the ball return. \"If the gutter wasn't there, I think it might've looped back and hit you.\"\n\n Mia crosses her arms. \"That was less of a throw and more of a surrender.\"\n\n You gesture helplessly at the lane. \"The ball's, like, heavier than it looks, alright? And my wrist... I don't know. My wrist just...\"\n\n Ashley nods solemnly. \"Sudden wrist pain, how tragic.\"\n\n \"I am never living this down, am I?\" you ask, groaning and slumping into the torn-up seat.\n\n \"Absolutely not,\" Mia says.\n\n \"Not a chance,\" Tori echoes cheerfully.\n\n Ashley shrugs. \"Maybe if you get a strike next time, we'll consider pretending this never happened.\"\n\n You roll your eyes, but there's a smile tugging at your lips anyway. Because even though you guttered the ball in the most humiliating way possible, it still feels okay. Like you're in on the joke, not the butt of it.\n\n \"You're up again in a few minutes, you know,\" Mia says, nudging your shoulder.\n\n You groan louder. \"Do I have to?\"\n\n \"Yes,\" Ashley says flatly. \"For character development.\"\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "Ashley nods decisively as you say the words: \"Let's get nachos.\"\n\n \"Good choice,\" she says, already standing up. \"Classic. Reliable. Can't go wrong with melted cheese.\"\n\n Mia throws her hands up. \"Ughhh, fine. But I still think we should've gotten fries. Like, with the works.\"\n\n \"We're already getting the works,\" Ashley replies coolly. \"It's just melted on corn chips instead of potato fries.\"\n\n Tori shrugs. \"I'll take it. As long as it comes with questionable amounts of cheese, I'm good.\"\n\n You all head toward the counter, where the same tired-looking college-aged employee from earlier is still manning the food stand, now visibly more dead inside than he was twenty minutes ago. His eyes widen slightly as the four of you approach.\n\n \"Uh,\" he begins, voice lifeless. \"Please tell me you're just here for napkins.\"\n\n \"A nacho platter please,\" Ashley says, calm as ever.\n\n He sighs, reaching for the register. \"Of course you are.\"\n\n Before he can tap it in, Roman swoops in from seemingly nowhere. \"Ah! Nachos! Very good, very American choice! You know, in Serbia we do not have such thing. We just eat the corn, yes?\" He slaps the counter with both hands, startling the college kids. \"I love it. I add to bill.\"\n\n He winks at you as he marches off with the order slip in hand, shouting toward the kitchen, \"One special tray of cheesy national pride!\"\n\n You make your way back to the table, half-laughing as Mia slumps dramatically into the booth. \"I have mixed thoughts on Roman. I kind of want him to narrate my life. I think it'd be interesting.\"\n\n \"Roman wouldn't just narrate your life,\" Tori says. \"He'd scream it into a megaphone.\"\n\n Ashley just slides into her seat without a word, arms crossed like she's already preparing for the nachos.\n\n When the tray finally arrives, it is beautiful. Glorious. A shimmering golden mound of tortilla chips, smothered in gooey cheddar and mozzarella, dotted with jalapeños. There's a dollop of sour cream on one side, a swirl of guacamole on the other, and more than enough salsa to go around.\n\n Even Mia has to stop and admire it. \"Okay,\" she says. \"Okay, maybe you have taste.\"\n\n \"That's a big compliment coming from you,\" you say, grinning.\n\n \"I said maybe. Don't get ahead of yourself.\"\n\n Tori grabs a chip, already stringing a melted strand of cheese halfway to her mouth. \"I feel like this is what winning tastes like.\"\n\n Ashley plucks a chip off the top. \"And this is why nachos always win. The structure, the texture, the distribution of toppings. It's perfect.\"\n\n You're halfway through your first chip when Mia sighs, savoring the cheese. \"Fine. [name] made a good choice.\"\n\n You try to act humble. \"Thank you. I try.\"\n\n She narrows her eyes. \"Don't get used to it.\"\n\n The four of you dig in, laughter bubbling up between bites. It's just you and the squad on a cheap tattered couch under the buzz of flickering bowling alley lights.\n\n \n The moment you say, \"Let's get the pizza,\" Tori slaps her palms on the table and practically jumps out of her seat.\n\n \"Yes! [name], you genius!\" she exclaims. \"You have taste. Like, actual taste. I knew I trusted you for a reason.\"\n\n Ashley raises an eyebrow, clearly skeptical, but doesn't object. \"Alright. As long as it's not one of those cardboard pizzas they leave under a heat lamp for several hours.\"\n\n Mia, arms crossed, snorts. \"It's bowling alley pizza. Prepare your standards accordingly.\"\n\n You make your way to the counter, your little trio shuffling behind you, and come face-to-face with the emotionally defeated college-aged employee. He sees your approach and visibly braces himself.\n\n \"Please don't say it,\" he mutters before you're even fully in earshot. \"Please don't say the word.\"\n\n You smile innocently. \"Can we get a pizza?\"\n\n The guy lets out a long, tortured breath. \"Yeah. Sure. Of course you can.\"\n\n But just like before, Roman materializes out of nowhere like a magician. His giant eyebrows are practically flapping from excitement.\n\n \"Pizza!\" he booms. \"Yes yes! Bellissimo! You know, in Serbia we have many opinions about pizza. Some say too much cheese, some say not enough. I say that it is art! It is like... Italy and America had beautiful love child and baked it in oven!\" He places a hand over his heart. \"I will make for you special pizza. Best pizza in entire city of Crestview Bay!\"\n\n \"There are a lot of authentic pizza places here,\" the employee says. \"They probably taste better then what we whip up in the back.\"\n\n Roman ignores him entirely. \"I put toppings! Many toppings! Pepperoni, mushroom, onion, and more! Whatever you want! No charge! It is homecoming! It is special night!\"\n\n \"We'll just take whatever's most popular,\" you say before he starts listing every ingredient in existence.\n\n \"Yes!\" Roman exclaims, clapping his hands. \"I love it. I make it beautiful. I add to bill.\"\n\n He spins off dramatically toward the kitchen, shouting something in Serbian, and the smell of bread and cheese soon starts wafting through the air.\n\n Back at the table, the four of you slide into the booth again, bantering while you wait. Tori is practically vibrating with excitement. \"Do you think they're gonna give us, like, the fun cheese? You know the one that stretches all long and gooey like in commercials?\"\n\n \"I'm more worried about whether it'll be edible,\" Mia says, arms still crossed.\n\n Ashley leans back. \"Roman said he'd make it beautiful. I'm holding him to that.\"\n\n Eventually, the man himself emerges from the back, red-faced and triumphant, balancing a large tray. \"Behold! Pizza of champions! I put my soul in crust!\"\n\n You take the tray from him with a grateful nod.\n\n To your surprise, it actually looks good. Like, really good. The crust is golden and crisp, the cheese is bubbling in all the right ways, and there's a generous layer of pepperoni, peppers, and onions all layered evenly. It's steaming hot, smells incredible, and looks like it came out of an actual pizzeria oven.\n\n Tori grabs the first slice and lets out a delighted squeal as a long strand of cheese follows. \"It's happening. My taste buds are ascending.\"\n\n Ashley takes a bite and pauses, eyebrows lifting. \"Okay. This is better than it has any right to be.\"\n\n Even Mia, who made a point to be unimpressed, chews slowly and mutters, \"I hate how much I like this.\"\n\n You grin, sliding a slice onto your plate. The first bite hits with a salty, cheesy, slightly spicy mix of perfection. It's not gourmet, but for a random bowling alley pizza, it might as well have 3 Michelin Stars.\n\n \"Well,\" you say, leaning back with a smirk. \"I make good choices.\"\n\n Tori gives you a mock bow. \"All hail [name], Bringer of Pizza.\"\n\n Ashley raises her soda in a toast. \"To edible miracles.\"\n\n And as you all dig in, laughing and arguing over who gets the slice with the most toppings, the bowling alley hums around you. Neon lights, thudding pins, and the comfortable rhythm of a night well-spent.\n\n \n The second you say, \"Let's just get the fries,\" Mia flashes a victorious smile so smug it's blinding.\n\n \"Knew I liked you,\" she says, already pushing back from the table like her word is final. \"Finally, someone with taste.\"\n\n Tori groans, flopping forward in exaggerated despair. \"We could've had pizza. Cheesy, stretchy, golden pizza. [name], I thought we were friends.\"\n\n \"Fries are safe,\" Ashley says, just shrugging. \"Hard to mess up fried potatoes.\"\n\n Together, you make your way toward the snack counter again. The employee behind it, poor soul, sees the group approaching and slumps forward. He lifts his head with all the enthusiasm of a man facing a firing squad.\n\n \"Let me guess,\" he says, already reaching for the grease-stained fry basket. \"Fries.\"\n\n \"Fries!\" you confirm with a grin.\n\n \"Lots of toppings,\" Mia adds with a devilish glint in her eye. \"We're taking cheese. Chili. Jalapeños. Maybe even some ranch drizzle.\"\n\n Tori's mood instantly rebounds. \"Ooh, can we get the curly ones too? Or like, a crinkle-cut mix?\"\n\n \"Yeah, sure, let me just open up all the bags real quick,\" the employee mutters, punching in your order.\n\n Before he can finish sighing, Roman bursts through the double doors again, eyes wide, arms flailing.\n\n \"Fries!\" he bellows. \"Yes! The humble potato! A food of great culture! French in name, but American in spirit! The crunch, the grease, the salt, all of it! It is like music for the tongue!\"\n\n He plants a firm hand on the counter, his other arm already gesturing wildly. \"You know what we do for homecoming heroes? We bless them! I give you cheese! I give you sauces! I give you mountain of flavor!\"\n\n The college worker groans. \"That means I have to—\"\n\n \"You shut mouth!\" Roman roars. \"They are champions! You are potato assistant!\"\n\n You try not to laugh as the toppings pile up. Cheddar, diced onions, little crumbles of bacon, chili, and even a zigzag of ranch for chaos. It's a glorious, greasy masterpiece by the time it's passed over in a massive cardboard tray.\n\n You and the others bring it back to the lane. Everyone leans in, inspecting the fry mountain like it's something special.\n\n Tori snatches the first bite. \"Oh my God. This is divine. This is, like, fries from heaven.\"\n\n Ashley nods, already chewing. \"Not bad.\"\n\n \"See?\" Mia says, smirking. \"Good choice.\"\n\n You grab your own handful. They're still hot, the cheese perfectly gooey, the chili a little spicy, and the fries underneath still crisp despite the mountain of toppings. It's rich and comforting and messy in all the best ways.\n\n You glance down at the tray and grin. \"I think Roman might've actually gone overboard.\"\n\n \"And yet, no regrets,\" Ashley says, wiping some sauce off her cheek.\n\n Mia leans back, smug again. \"Still think pizza would've been better?\"\n\n \"Okay, fine, maybe this was worth it.\" Tori admits, shrugging.\n\n You just laugh, the warm hum of the bowling alley surrounding you. For a post-game hangout on a Friday night, it doesn't get much better than this.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

You just lie there, flat on your back, eyes barely open. You groan and shift under the blanket, half-kicking it off as you blindly reach for your phone on the nightstand. You knock some stuff over before your fingers find it. You squint at the screen.\n\n8:41 AM.\n\nYour heart stutters. That's late. That's so late. School's already halfway into first period.\n\n\"Shit,\" you breathe, bolting upright.\n\nThe blankets tangle around your ankles as you scramble out of bed. Your pajama pants get caught under your heel and you nearly trip trying to shake them off. You snatch your favorite pair of cargo shorts from a chair and step into them one leg at a time, hopping in place to pull them up.\n\n\"Mom!\" you shout toward the door, voice cracking. \"Why didn't you wake me up?! I'm gonna be late. Seriously, I'm so late.\"\n\nYou start grabbing at your pajama top's hem while rummaging for a top, everything still fuzzy around the edges.\n\n\"Mom!\"\n\nYou hear the soft shuffle of slippers against the hallway floor for a moment before the door creaks open. Your mom appears, holding a mug of coffee in both hands. She's wearing her thick robe, the old one she's had for years, a pair of reading glasses propped up on her head. Her expression is somewhere between confusion and amusement.\n\nShe leans into the doorway and takes one long look at you. You're half-dressed, your hair is everywhere, you have no socks on, and you're clutching a rumpled white T-shirt like your life depends on it. She raises her eyebrows.\n\n\"[name],\" she say, smiling gently. \"Sweetheart. It's Saturday.\"\n\nYou freeze.\n\n\"...What?\"\n\n\"It's Saturday,\" she says again, clearly trying not to laugh. \"There's no school today. You went to the game last night, remember?\"\n\nYou just stand there, holding the T-shirt in one hand, your pajama top barely on, your cargo shorts sitting crooked on your hips. Your brain spins its wheels like it's still trying to catch up. Hold up, you did go to the game. Last night wasn't a dream. And if that was yesterday...\n\nYou blink.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n[Choice: So... not late?]",

      "text": "Your mom chuckles softly as she steps into the room, taking a small sip of tea. The smell of chamomile drifts with her, warm and soothing. She probably brewed it for herself and was drinking it right before she heard you yelling.\n\n\"It happens,\" she says gently, walking over to the edge of your bed and sitting down. \"I've done it more times than I can count. One time I got all the way to the freeway before realizing it was a holiday.\"\n\nYou let out a breath laugh and sit next to her. She runs a hand through your hair, trying to get to flatten a little. It doesn't.\n\n\"I can't believe I did that,\" you say, gesturing vaguely to yourself. \"I was about to start brushing my teeth. If you didn't tell me, I might've sprinted out the door in mismatched shoes.\"\n\nShe smiles at that, the corners of her eyes creasing.\n\n\"And the best part?\" you add, holding up your phone for dramatic effect. \"There wasn't even an alarm. I just panicked on instinct. My body betrayed me.\"\n\n\"Poor thing,\" she says, setting her mug down on the nightstand. \"You've had a lot going on lately. You shopped, and with the game last night...\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" you say. \"It was kind of a lot.\"\n\nThere's a quiet moment between you, with the only sound you can hear being the neighbor's dog barking.\n\nThen s he reaches over and brushes a piece of hair away from your eye, her fingers cool and gentle.\n\n\"Are you planning on going to Homecoming tonight?\" she asks, her voice light but careful.\n\nYou glance at her, then back at your lap, where your phone still rests in your hands. It's turned itself off. You tap it once just to have something to do.\n\n\"...I'm thinking about it,\" you say after a moment.\n\nShe hums, nodding slowly, like she's giving you time to find the shape of your own thoughts.\n\n\"I remember my senior year Homecoming,\" she says suddenly, smiling to herself as she leans back like she's settling into a memory. \"It was... oh, gosh. 1999, maybe? I had this spaghetti strap dress from Sears. I thought I was so cool.\"\n\nShe's already off.\n\n\"And I tried to do one of those zigzag parts in my hair, because it was all the rage back t hen, but mine just looked horrible. I begged your grandma to let me borrow her purse. She let me borrow it, but it was tiny. It could only fit, like, a tube of lipstick.\"\n\n\"I went with a boy named Marcus Vasquez,\" she continues. \"Very cute. Great smile. He wore this powder blue tuxedo with ruffles. Ruffles, [name]. Apparently, his mom picked it out. I thought it was charming. He thought it was ugly. He really wanted to impress me.\"\n\n\"We danced to ...Baby One More Time. Britney Spears, I'm sure you've heard the song at least once. It's a classic.\" Her eyes are distant in that way adults get when they think they're giving you something meaningful, but they're really just recounting their teenage history. \"And then, get this, his shoe came off during a dance! It just flew away. He kicked the other one off to match. Danced the rest of the night in his socks. I thought that was the coolest thing I'd ever seen.\"\n\nShe looks at you fondly, eyes sparkling with parental glee. It's clear she knows she sounds ridiculous, but is telling you anyway.\n\n[Choice: I don't have a date, is that okay?]\n[Choice: I can't believe this is my last high school homecoming]\n[Choice: I don't really care about what you did 25 years ago, Mom]",

      "text": "\"I don't have a date,\" you say, the words coming out more hesitantly than you expected. \"Is that... okay?\"\n\n Your mom blinks at you, caught a little off guard. It's not by the question itself, but rather the way you asked it. She takes a few seconds before turning toward you, resting one hand on the bed between you both.\n \n \"[name],\" she says, her voice gentle, \"of course that's okay.\"\n\n You shift a little on the edge of the mattress, not quite looking at her, but not turning away either.\n\n \"You don't need a date to go,\" she continues. \"And you definitely don't need one to have a good time. I promise.\"\n\n You nod a little, not sure what to say. It's not like you were desperate for one. But when everyone else is pairing up, when you hear people talking about who's taking who and what outfits match what necklace, it's hard not to feel like you're supposed to show up with someone.\n\n Your mom must see that flicker of doubt still hanging around your eyes, because she leans in a little, her voice softening even more.\n\n \"Can I tell you something?\" she asks.\n\n \"Sure,\" you murmurs.\n\n \"I've learned, maybe a little too late, that the only person who can really make you happy... is you.\"\n\n She gives your hand a light squeeze.\n\n \"You know, for a long time, I kept thinking if I just had the right person, or the right job, or people saw me a certain way... I'd feel okay. Like I'd finally be happy. But it doesn't work like that. No one thing fixes everything. Life's still hard. People are still complicated. What matters about today is not whether you bring a date or what people think of you, it's where or not you have a good time and have fun. That's what I want you to keep in mind, [name]. I want you to be happy more than anything else.\"\n\n You let her words settle.\n\n \"Got a little serious there, huh?\" she asks, smiling sheepishly. \"Sorry. I mean to keep it light. I was just thinking about how far you've come lately. And I guess I didn't want you going into tonight thinking you had to meet anyone's expectations but your own.\"\n\n The corner of your mouth tugs upward despite yourself. Then, without saying anything, you lean over and rest your head against her shoulder. She puts a hand on your head and ruffles your hair lightly.\n\n No pressure. No rush. Just a mother and her child sharing a moment.\n\n \n \n \"I can't believe this is my last high school Homecoming,\" you say, voice low and thoughtful. You feel like you were running around the playground just a few days ago, and now here you are.\n\n Your mom chuckles. Not because she isn't taking your feelings seriously, but rather because she knows this feeling all too well. \"I remember my high school graduation,\" she says, smiling faintly. \"After I went home, I looked at myself in the mirror and I was absolutely convinced that that night was the end of something huge. I cried. A lot, actually. I couldn't believe this part of my life was over.\"\n\n She glances over at you, her voice steady but warm.\n\n \"And in a way, I was right. It was the end of something. High school gave me so many moments, so many memories. But what I didn't understand yet is that endings like this are just the start of something else.\"\n\n You nod.\n\n \"I know it probably feels like everything's moving way too quickly. And you're not wrong. Everything does move quickly. It doesn't slow down. But you're eighteen, [name]. You've barely taken your first step out the door, and there's a whole world waiting for you outside.\"\n\n You finally look at her then. \"That's... kinda comforting.\"\n\n \"Growing up really sneaks up on you, huh?\" she asks. \"You know, when I was your age, I thought I was old. Eighteen, an adult. But now that I'm in my forties, I look at you and still see someone that's so young. Not in a bad way. Just full of time. Full of possibility. [name], you're not behind. You're not running out of anything.\"\n\n \"I just thought I'd feel more like a grown-up by now,\" you admit. \"But everything still feels like I'm just pretending. Like I'm still a kid, but taller.\"\n\n That makes her smile. \"Sweetie, everyone feels like that. We're all confused people in a confused world doing the best we can. And I'm so, so proud of who you've grown up to be so far. I can't wait to see more.\"\n\n You nod, soaking in the words.\n\n \"Thanks,\" you say.\n\n \"Anytime,\" she replies.\n\n She sets her mug aside and reaches out, wrapping her arms around you in a slow, deliberate hug. You hesitate for a half second before hugging her back.\n\n \"You've got a lot more firsts coming, you know,\" she says. \"So don't let one last thing convince you it's all behind you. It's not. It's barely even gotten started.\"\n\n \n \"I don't really care what you did 25 years ago, Mom.\"\n\n <<if [momRelo] > 89>> \n The words come out sharper than you mean them to, but you don't take them back. You're still tired, still in these rumpled cargo shorts, your chest tight from the spike of adrenaline from the morning panic.\n\n There's a long pause.\n\n You don't hear her sip her tea. You don't hear her laugh. You don't hear anything, actually. When you finally glance over, she's still sitting on your bed, but her expression has changed. She's not angry, your mom's never really been the yelling type. She's not even disappointed, exactly. Just... quiet. She tucks her hands into the sleeves of her robe and lowers her gaze, her mouth pressing into a soft line.\n\n \"I thought I could talk about that now,\" she says carefully. \"With how things have been lately.\"\n\n You don't say anything.\n\n \"I know I'm not always the easiest person to talk to,\" she continues, gently. \"I know I try too hard sometimes, or say things at the wrong time. But when I came in here, and you were listening, I thought maybe we were finally...\" She trails off like she doesn't want to say it out loud.\n\n She looks down at the floor.\n\n \"I was hoping to get to know you better,\" she says. \"And I thought it'd only be fair for you to get to know me better, too.\"\n\n That last part is quiet. She's not bitter or trying to guilt-trip you. She's just being honest. She lets out a breath through her nose and carefully stands up. She doesn't look mad or like she's on the verge of tears. She just looks... older. Smaller.\n\n \"Well... I won't bother you then,\" she says. \"There's a few microwavables in the kitchen if you're hungry. Or I can cook you something, if you want. Just let me know.\"\n\n She smiles again, but it's small. Then she turns and walks to the door, not closing it all the way behind her. She doesn't slam or sigh, leaving only a door that's cracked open, waiting for you to step through.\n \n \n The words come out sharper than you mean them ton. They're flat, tired, and a little edged from the lingering fog. Yet, despite all that, they linger. It's a sentence that shouldn't really have even been imagined, let alone said.\n\n A part of you expects her to laugh it off. Maybe she'll tease you about being cranky in the morning or make some corny comeback about how at least her Homecoming didn't involve \"panic cargo shorts.\"\n\n But she doesn't.\n\n After a few agonizing seconds of silence, you finally glance over. She's still sitting next to you on your bed, hands folded in her lap. The mug has been forgotten on the nightstand. Her expression isn't angry. She's not going to yell at you, but that might just be easier.\n\n Instead, she just looks smaller.\n\n \"...Right. Of course.\"\n\n She forces a smile, but it doesn't quite reach her eyes. \"I guess I'm showing my age, huh?\" she says. \"I just thought it might... I don't know. Never mind.\"\n \n She picks up her mug again, but doesn't bother drinking from it. Just cradles it as if it might warm something that your words left cold.\n\n You shift uncomfortably, but she doesn't say anything else. No reminder of everything she's done for you. No mention of the night she stayed up washing your clothes after you fell asleep, or how she rearranged her schedule so she could drive you across town to a camp you only stuck with for two weeks. No stories about the little things she remembers: how you hated itchy tags on your shirts or how you once cried because you thought she'd forgotten your birthday, even though she'd spent weeks planning the surprise.\n\n She just sits there for a moment longer.\n\n Then she stands, brushing a wrinkle from her robe, like it gives her something to do.\n\n \"Well... I won't bother you then,\" she says. \"There's a few microwavables in the kitchen if you're hungry. Or I can cook you something, if you want. Just let me know.\"\n\n She smiles again, but it's small. Then she turns and walks to the door, not closing it all the way behind her. She doesn't slam or sigh, leaving only a door that's cracked open, waiting for you to step through.",

You call on the group chat, and they quickly pick up.\n\n\"Hey, [name], what's up?\" Luke asks.\n\n\"Yeah, why'd you call?\" Samantha's familiar voice says over the speaker.\n\n\"Do you guys want to hang out real quick?\" you say. \"It's the weekend, you know?\"\n\nYou quickly make plans and end up meeting up at the town square. You start making your way toward the Cedarbrook town square when you smell the aroma of meat. You speed up, and after a minute, make your way to the town square. You spot that a few food trucks have set up for the weekend, and a bunch of meat is being cooked. You look around the benches to see Luke lounging on a bench and Samantha waving you over.\n\n\"Finally, took you long enough,\" Samantha grins as you approach. \"How are you going to plan the hangout and show up late?\"\n\n\"He was probably staring at the mirror,\" Luke snorts, putting his phone away. \"You've been doing that a lot lately, [name].\"\n\n \n \"You know why,\" you say, rolling your eyes. You're surprised that even Luke noticed that you've been staring in the mirror more lately.\n\n \n \"I have my reasons,\" you say, a little nervous.

Can't get fat now, can you?\"\n\n\"I'm the most athletic person here and I eat double what you eat,\" Luke laughs, clearly not taking Samantha's comment seriously.\n\nLuke picks up a massive BBQ burger, Samantha a burrito, and you get a taco plate with a mix of flavors. You guys settle back on the bench, paper plates in your hands.\n\n\"So, how was the first week of school, everyone?\" Samantha asks, trying to spark a conversation.\n\n\"It would've been good if I didn't embarrass myself in gym class,\" Luke sighs and shakes his head. \"I got someone else's gym kit by accident.\"\n\n\"Hold up, what?\" \n\n\"I accidentally took someone else's gym clothes and didn't even notice,\" Luke chuckles to himself. \"I was like, why the fuck are these so tight today? I thought I grew bigger over the summer or something. Turns out I just took the gym kit of someone three inches shorter than me.\"\n\n\"You're stupid,\" you can't help but laugh, and Samantha joins in.\n\n\"That's not even the worst part,\" Luke holds up a finger. \"The guy whose gym kit I stole came out with my gym kit on because he couldn't find his.\"\n\n\"Dumb and dumber, huh?\" Samantha asks, snorting. \n\n\"Maybe,\" Luke shrugs.\n\nAs the three of you finish up your meals, you throw away the plates and make your way toward a record store.\n\n[Choice: Check out the record store]",

The three of you jump in surprise, swinging around to see an old man. He appears to be the owner of the shop. \"Vinyl captures audio in analog form without any compression, so it sounds much better.\"\n\nThe three of you quickly murmur apologies, realizing the store owner heard everything you said.

      "text": "You move through the aisles of the record store, letting your fingers lightly graze the spines of vinyls. You make your way to the rock section, and notice several legendary album covers. Nestled in between The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd is Led Zeppelin IV. You take the album out from the shelf, admiring the design.\n\n \"Boring!\" Samantha says, looking at the album you have in your hands. \"What is this, even? I've never seen this before.\"\n\n \"You're uncultured, Samantha,\" Luke rolls his eyes. \"I don't even like rock but I know Led Zeppelin.\"\n\n \"Led Zeppelin?\" Samantha furrows her eyebrows. \"Isn't that the group that made Smoke on the Water?\"\n\n \"No, that's Deep Purple,\" you say, a little disturbed about Samantha's lack of knowledge. \"Have you ever heard of Stairway to Heaven?\"\n\n \"I would be pissed if they made me go upstairs to reach heaven,\" Samantha laughs. \"Like, I just died. Give me a break.\"\n\n \"Ignore her,\" Luke can't help but chuckle.\n\n \"Hey, it's not my fault I don't know these bands from prehistoric times.\"\n \n You share a knowing look with Luke, disappointment crossing both of your faces. \n\n \n You weave through the record store, eventually ending up in the indie section. The vibe of the store shifts, as even the decor in this section is different. There are posters of old underground bands plastered across the walls and handwritten staff recommendations. The records here aren't very mainstream, but that might be exactly why you're drawn to them.\n\n Your eyes scan over some well-loved indie staples—records from The Smiths, Joy Division, and The Velvet Underground are on the shelves. But one album in particular catches your attention: Doolittle by the Pixies. You slide it off the shelf, staring at the cover art. You know a few songs by the Pixies but never listened to a full album of theirs. You remember hearing that Doolittle was a very important part of indie rock history.\n\n \"What are you looking at?\" Samantha asks, peeking her head over your shoulder. She stares at the monkey on the album cover and giggles. \"Look, Puke, that's you.\"\n\n \"That is not me,\" Luke sighs and shakes his head. \"I do have the strength of an ape though.\"\n\n \"Too bad you have the brain of one too,\" Samantha sighs.\n\n \n You wander over to the pop section, where there are a ton of recent albums that you know of. Rows of popular records line the shelves, from classic pop acts like Michael Jackson to today's artists like Taylor Swift. There's a sense of familiarity since you've grown up listening to many of these artists. You end up picking up an album that was an essential part of your childhood, Doo-Wops & Hooligans by Bruno Mars.\n\n \"Oh my God, a good album!\" Samantha says, excited to see Bruno Mars. \"This section has albums I actually know.\"\n\n \"Yeah, because you don't listen to anything other than what's charting,\" Luke rolls his eyes. \n\n \"I know some real underground stuff, alright?\" Samantha says, moving her hands around trying to be mysterious. \"For example, do you know of the Arctic Monkeys? I just found out about them a week ago.\"\n\n \"Yeah, she's hopeless,\" Luke says, shaking his head. \n\n \"They're pretty unknown,\" Samantha crosses her arms. \"They only have 40 million monthly listeners on Spotify.\"\n\n You share a knowing look with Luke, disappointment crossing both of your faces. \n\n \n You end up in the hip-hop section, and you can feel a raw energy buzzing in the air. The passion of the artists shines through the striking album covers. You glance over the selection, noting some of the biggest names in hip-hop. Nas, Kanye, Tupac, and Biggie all line the shelves. \n\n Your eyes end up settling on Good Kid, M.A.A.D City though, an album that you're a little familiar with. You know it has a great concept, with an intense and engaging story.\n\n \"Ooh, that's a classic,\" Luke says, his eyes filled with approval. \"I really like Kendrick and this is, in my opinion, his best album.\"\n\n \"Oh my God, that's the guy who feuded with Drake?\" Samantha asks, picking up on Kendrick Lamar's name.\n\n \"You didn't know?\" Luke asks.\n\n \"I listened to the diss track but that's it,\" Samantha shrugs, clearly not too interested in Kendrick's artistry. \n\n You share a knowing look with Luke, disappointment crossing both of your faces.\n \n\n\"Anyway, we can't buy anything,\" Luke says, shrugging. \"That is unless you have a record player at home.\"\n\n\"Aw, okay,\" you say, putting the vinyl back on the shelf. \n\nYou end up leaving with your hands empty, feeling a little bad that you didn't buy anything. If you had a record player, you totally would've bought an album.\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

You look around, trying to decide where you should go.\n\nNestled on a quieter street, there's an inviting little bookstore known for its selection of popular novels. It's a little messy, but in a charming way, with a faded wooded sign reading Chapter & Page. If you walk a little though, you can make your way to Sycamore Park. It's full of lush green, and there are a bunch of trees, ponds, cute critters, and an expansive walking trail. It's a really popular spot for people to hang out on the weekend, and you haven't gone in a while.\n\nJust down the street, the colorful arcade also draws your attention. The air near Pixel Palace is thick with whooping, the sound of 8-bit music, and the furious clicking of buttons. You could dive into a quick game to blow off the stress of the first week of school. Your final option would be to go behind the main strip to a small community art studio called Creative Corner. You haven't ever gone there before, the best you could draw was a stick figure, but you could take some time to sketch something.\n\n[Choice: Go to the bookstore]\n[Choice: Go to the park]\n[Choice: Go to the arcade]\n[Choice: Go to the art studio]",

You can already imagine it dangling from your backpack as you walk through your school's hallways. You carefully maneuver the claw, aiming it just right. With a quick press, the claw drops, but you're completely off. The claw grabs at the air, and you're left with nothing. You chuckle at the missed opportunity.\n\n \n Your attention is caught by the glow-in-the-dark alien. It's mysterious and a bit quirky, exactly what you wanted. You can imagine it perched on your desk, glowing slightly green when the lights go out. You take aim with the joystick, moving the claw over the little alien. With a surge of confidence, you press the button and watch as the claw descends. Just as you think you've got it, the claw suddenly weakens and drops the alien. You laugh, a little frustrated by how the claw suddenly lost power. \n \n\nYou step back from the machine, and although you didn't win a prize this time, you're still left smiling.

He turns the book toward you, showing you the title, The Stars Beyond. \"It's not just action and fights — it really does go a lot deeper than that. The synopsis is that each multiverse they explore reflects something about the crew's own personalities! They're basically exploring different versions of themselves each time they go to another dimension.\"\n\n \"Huh, sounds like it messes with your head a little,\" you nod, intrigued by how Vincent is describing the book. \"I didn't realize sci-fi could get that philosophical.\"\n\n \"Well, science fiction is one of those genres that can really explore a lot,\" Vincent replies, a sparkle in his eyes. \"There's this one chapter where the main character is literally staring at a version of herself in a world where she made different choices. She ended up with a different career, relationships, and has a totally different life. It really is haunting if you think about it because it makes her question if she'd be happier that way. I'll stop rambling, but it really makes you think about who you could've been.\"\n\n \"No, don't worry,\" you say, trying to soothe Vincent as he looks embarrassed. \"That sounds really cool, thanks for letting me know.\"\n\n \"I really love that about sci-fi,\" Vincent sheepishly grins. \"Most people think it's just about the technology and the adventure, but it's really not! It's about exploring who we are and the paths we didn't take. Thanks for letting me yap, I love talking about this kind of stuff.\"\n\n \n \"So, I'm starting to think you've got a bit of a book addiction, Vincent,\" you say as you lean in with a smirk. \"How many have you read this month? Fifteen? Twenty? Maybe one every day?\"\n\n \"Oh, come on!\" Vincent laughs, his cheeks faintly turning red. \"It's not an addiction. I just really enjoy reading.\"\n\n \"I see you with a book every time I spot you at school,\" you chuckle, unconvinced by Vincent's rebuttal. \"At this rate, you're going to end up becoming a librarian.\"\n\n \"What's wrong with that, exactly?\" Vincent chuckles, hugging the book to his chest. \"At least I'll be well-read. On the other hand, you'll be clueless about all the amazing worlds out there.\"\n\n \"Is that your goal?\" you tease, crossing your arms. \"To be the most well-read guy in the city?\"\n\n \n \"Knowledge is power,\" Vincent smirks. \"I know you like reading too! Don't tease me for it.\"\n\n \"It's just funny to tease you about,\" you chuckle. \"But I don't read nearly as much as you do.\"\n \n \n \"Knowledge is power,\" Vincent smirks. \"Maybe one day I'll convince you to pick up a book too! That would be nice.\"\n\n \"One of these days, you might just be able to convince me to,\" you feign a dramatic sigh. \"But today is not that day.\"\n \n\n \"You know, if I'm the city's unofficial librarian, you'll have to keep coming back for updates on the latest books.\"\n\n \"I can't promise anything, but I'll try,\" you smile. \n\n \n \n \"So, do you come here a lot?\" you ask, glancing around the cozy space. \"Like, to Chapter & Page, I mean.\"\n\n \"I do, it's kind of my go-to place whenever I'm bored,\" Vincent chuckles. \"I mean, it's close enough to walk to, and they have a lot of nice books. Plus, the owners always bring in interesting new titles.\"\n\n \"I can see the appeal,\" you say, nodding. \"It seems like a nice place to be.\"\n\n \"I know, right?\" Vincent's eyes light up as he talks about the shop. \"Not to mention, they actually care about books here. It's not just another boring bookstore opened by a corporation.\"\n\n \"Oh, are you a regular?\" you ask, intrigued. \"Do you know the owners?\"\n\n \"Of course, they're Mr. Patel and Mrs. Patel,\" Vincent smiles. \"Mr. Patel's really into sci-fi and fantasy, and he's always giving me recommendations after I blaze through a book. Matter of fact, he's the one who recommended me the book I'm reading right now.\"\n\n \"This sounds like a nice place to hang out,\" you can't help but smile too at Vincent's enthusiasm. \"You have a spot that's just yours here.\"\n\n \"Exactly! If you ever need a break from everything, this place is always welcoming. Give it a shot sometime.\"\n \n\nAs you continue the conversation, you two have a lot of fun talking. The conversation naturally winds down after a while, and Vincent looks back at his book. it seems like he's caught between continuing the conversation and going back to his book.\n\n\"Well, I should probably get back to this,\" Vincent raises his book slightly. \"But it was really cool running into you today. I don't usually get to chat with anyone.\"\n\n\"Same here, I wasn't expecting to run into you today,\" you feel the warmth of his sincerity. \"Maybe I'll catch you around again,\" you say. \"I could use a few recommendations myself.\"\n\n\"I'll keep an eye out for you,\" he promises. \"If you ever need a book recommendation, you know who to come to. I have a few hundred stored up.\"\n\n\"I'll remember that,\" you say. You wave and head off, exiting the bookstore.

A vivid memory of you playing dress-up with your sister, Lily, comes to mind. Your mom had dragged down an old box filled with a bunch of old clothes from the basement, and the thing was basically a treasure chest for you.\n\n With each outfit change, you'd become a different character. Superheroes, fantasy characters, and aliens were all within the realm of imagination. You remember at one point, you found a dress that was just your size. It fit perfectly, and you soon were lost in the folds of an elegant, flowing dress. You turned this way and that, admiring how the dress shifted and shimmered. The fabric brushed against your skin in a way that none of your boring male clothes had.\n\n In the sketch, you draw yourself gazing into the mirror, a wide-eyed expression on your young face. You try to capture the moment the best you can, the sense of awe you felt when you stared at your reflection. It felt both familiar and foreign like you were seeing a piece of yourself you hadn't quite met yet. The memory brings a pang of nostalgia, as well as a faint ache deep inside of you that you can't quite place.\n\n As you finish the drawing, you sit back and study it. The image stirs a quiet realization within you, but you can't quite articulate it. There's a spark there, a connection that you hadn't noticed as a kid. \n\n \"That's really beautiful,\" Ms. Harper says, glancing over your shoulder. Her expressions soften as she sees your art. \"It seems like a very special memory.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you nod. You're not sure what this memory means for now, but it lingers, leaving you with some questions that you're not sure you want answered. \n\n \n \n \n You stare at the blank page in front of you, remembering your younger days when you used to play soccer. You spent countless hours on the soccer field, hair drenched in sweat and cleats scuffing against the grass. The thrill of the competition fills your memory as you pick up a pencil and begin to bring it to life.\n\n Steadying your hand the best you can, you start to sketch a scene from a match. You draw yourself in your old soccer uniform, charging toward the ball with determination. The small details that faded away with time come back to you as well, and you remember the dirt on your knees, the adrenaline coursing through your veins, and the pride that rushed through you when you scored a goal.\n\n Soccer had been one of the few things that made you feel powerful and confident, almost invincible. It was a time before all the complicated feelings you deal with now. As you finish the drawing, your gaze lingers on your younger self. There's a sense of nostalgia, a bittersweet longing for those carefree days. \n\n \"It looks like you captured the spirit of a fighter,\" she nods approvingly. \"Soccer seems to mean a lot to you.\"\n\n \"It used to, yeah,\" you reply, managing a small smile. \n\n \n \n Memories of your family camping trip come flooding back into your mind. You remember the summer when your family had packed up a rented RV with camping gear and supplies, and heading out into the woods. It was one of those rare times they'd all been together without work, school, or anything else getting in the way. Just nature and each other's company.\n\n You begin sketching the towering pine trees that had surrounded the campsite, remembering how they seemed to stretch up endlessly. You begin to remember the chilly morning air, the soft crunch of leaves underfoot, and the sunrise reflecting on the nearby lake's surface.\n\n You add detail to the sketch, remembering how your dad showed you how to set up the tent. Your mom laughed as you fumbled through starting a fire, with Lily not helping at all. You finally decide on a moment to capture, putting the four of you by the campfire. You add a faint smile to your sketched self, sitting by the fire and looking at your family. That moment feels safe, like a memory frozen in time. \n\n You step back to view the finished sketch, and you realize just how grounding that trip had been. It was a time you felt connected. Surrounded by those you cared about. Moments like that felt increasingly harder to come by, and you felt a newfound appreciation for your family.\n\n \"That's a beautiful memory,\" Ms. Harper leans over to take a look, her eyes warm with approval. \"It's clear you put a lot of yourself into it.\"\n\n \"Yeah, that was a good time,\" you nod. \n \n\nYou hold the piece of paper in your hands and feel a swirl of emotions—nostalgia, curiosity, and perhaps a hint of longing. You feel like you truly captured a piece of yourself on the paper. You look at Ms. Harper, who gives you an encouraging smile.\n\n\"You're more of an artist than you give yourself credit for,\" she says, her eyes filled with understanding. \"That art you created, that moment you drew, it's a reflection of who you are. Art has a funny way of bringing out things we didn't even know we had inside of us.\"\n\nYou smile, feeling oddly proud. Your sketch is rough around the edges, sure, but you think you did pretty well for the first attempt. \"Thank you, I didn't really think about it like that.\"\n\n\"Look, try and keep at it,\" Ms. Harper says. \"You'll be surprised at what you discover.\"\n\nYou step out of the studio, feeling a sense of satisfaction. \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

A part of you is a little excited to find out more about the curse, but another part of you feels some unease. This part of the park is quiet, with only the sounds of a light breeze rustling the leaves and the faint ripple of water from the nearby pond. Aurora stands there, arms crossed, looking like she didn't have a care in the world.

The more you understand yourself, the more control you'll gain over what's happening.\"\n\n\"So, if I start making choices based on who I want to be, it'll affect the changes?\"\n\n\"Yes, but the deeper you go, the harder it'll be to turn back\" she replies, looking over you to gauge your reaction. \"I can help you gain some control over it if you're ready.\"\n\nYou swallow, feeling a lump in your throat.

So I started doing my own studies on the topic.\"\n\n\"Your own studies?\" you ask in a soft whisper.\n\n\"I've read texts, practiced rituals, and even met people like Madame Serena who understand more than I do,\" Aurora looks at you, her eyes filled with a burning intensity. \"Magic is real, [name]. It's not the kind of magic you see in movies, with a bunch of wizards and flashy spells, but it's real enough. It's about channeling energy, understanding intention, and unlocking parts of yourself you didn't know were there. I could notice your energy was off as if it was affected by magic. That's how I figured out about your spell.\"\n\n\"I mean, I knew magic was real, but hearing it like this...\" you trail off, not quite knowing what to say. \n\n\"You know, I could teach you,\" she says. \"It won't be easy, and I'm not sure if you even want to learn.

The idea of learning magic is enticing, but the enormity of it all scares you.\n\n\"I don't know, to be honest,\" she laughs softly. \"When I started down this path, I was all alone. Nobody believes in magic, even at school everyone thinks I'm just weird. I want to help others that are interested in this, that's why I'm the leader of the occult club. Maybe I just want to give someone else a chance to walk this road, but without the confusion I had to go through.\"\n\nFor a moment, the two of you stand in silence, the breeze rustling the trees around you.

After some internal debate, you walk over to Jordan.\n\n \"Hey, Jordan,\" you begin awkwardly. \"Do you mind spotting me?\"\n\n Jordan's eyebrows furrow further, clearly not having expected you to ask for help. He hesitates, seeming to gauge if you're serious or not. After a while, he shrugs and makes his way toward you.\n\n \"Alright,\" he says. \"If you go for too much weight though, I'm letting it drop.\"\n\n \"I'll stick to what I can handle,\" you say, adjusting the weights on the barbell. \n\n He moves into place behind you on the bench. His eyes are sharp and focused as he watches you settle and get into position. \"Go for it.\"\n\n You start your reps, feeling a little safer with Jordan. His hands hover close to the bar, ready to assist if needed. With each lift, you can sense his presence.\n\n \"Slow down a little,\" he says, voice low. \"Don't rush it. Just focus on controlling the weight.\"\n\n You nod, adjusting your rhythm. You immediately feel a difference, but after a few more reps, your arms begin burning.\n\n \"Last two, come on,\" Jordan encourages you, much to your surprise. \"Finish strong.\"\n\n You complete the final rep, setting the bar back on the rack with his help. You let out a relived breath, taking a second to rest on the bench.\n\n \"Not bad,\" Jordan crosses his arms. \"Watch your grip though, you'll strain your wrist if you do it like that.\"\n\n \"Thank you,\" you nod, grateful for the tip. \"I'm glad you didn't let the bar drop.\"\n\n \"No problem,\" he shrugs nonchalantly, but his eyes hold some approval. \"Just don't go overestimating what you can lift.\"\n\n \n You notice Jordan going through an intense set, each movement controlled and precise. The sheer determination on his face is striking, and it's clear he's spent hours upon hours in the gym. Your curiosity gets the better of you, and you step a bit closer. You wait for Jordan to finish with his set before piping up.\n\n \"You're making that look way too easy. How long have you been working out?\"\n\n Jordan glances up at you, seeming surprised. \"Long enough,\" he says gruffly. He wipes his brow with a towel. \"It doesn't come easy though, it's all about consistency. Even on days where I'd rather do anything else, I come to the gym.\"\n\n \"It shows, you're amazing,\" you nod. \"I can barely handle a few pounds, meanwhile your weights are super big. Do you have any advice for me?\"\n\n Jordan glances away, and you're scared he'll just ignore you. He looks back though, sighing. \"First, don't focus on trying to look cool. Some people just go for the heavy weights to flex or something, but their form is terrible. Just take it seriously and don't rush.\"\n\n \"Trust me, I don't have much of an ego,\" you chuckle.\n\n \"Good,\" you can Jordan's lip twitch a little. Did he almost smile? \"If you're looking to stick with this, don't just mess around either. Figure out what you want from it.\"\n\n \"I'm just looking to be a little healthier, I guess,\" you respond.\n\n \"That's a good goal to have,\" Jordan's expression softens slightly, although he quickly hides it. \"As long as you're not wasting your time here, I guess that's a start.\"\n\n \"Thanks, I'll try not to mess up too much,\" you say, grateful that Jordan took his time to chat with you.\n \n\nWith a final nod, Jordan heads back to his own weights. There's a slight shift in his demeanor. While he's not warm by any means, he's no longer as distant. You sense a tiny crack in his tough exterior. It's a start, and as you return to your own routine, you feel a tinge more confident. \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "You notice a sign advertising a yoga class that'll begin in a few minutes. You've never tried yoga before, but you feel a little curious as you stare at the sign. The class has already begun to gather in one corner of the gym, with a mix of people stretching, some setting down mats, and a calm instructor greeting everyone. You shrug and head toward them, deciding to give it a go.\n\nYou grab a mat and find a spot near the back, feeling too scared to be up in the front. The instructor, a tall woman with a soothing voice, introduces herself.\n\n\"Welcome, everyone, I'm Ms. Delaney!\" she says, a serene smile on her face. \"Whether you're a yoga veteran or brand new, this is the space to relax, unwind, and challenge yourself. Let's get started with some breathing.\"\n\nAs you move from one pose to the next, you quickly realize yoga is not as easy as you thought. Holding the warrior pose required a lot more strength and energy than you anticipated. There is still something grounding about the whole experience though, as you move through the poses in sync with the others. You find your mind clearing as you focus on each breath and stretch. \n\nWhen the class shifts into a seated forward fold, you notice some of the other students sneaking curious glances at you. Most people here seem to be women in their 20s, and they're surprised to see a high school guy in a yoga class. Instead of feeling nervous though, you just focus on your breathing.\n\n\"Let go of any thoughts or worries you have,\" Ms. Delaney says. \"Breathe into the moment, my dears.\"\n\nAfter a while, she leads you into a final resting position called Savasana. Lying flat on your back, you feel a deep relaxation wash over you, as if you're floating. It's a rare, peaceful moment of stillness. \n\nAs the class ends, Ms. Delaney thanks everyone for coming. You feel surprisingly refreshed, your muscles pleasantly stretched. Your mind seems a little clearer too, although you're unsure if that's a placebo or not. You're a little sore, but you appreciated the challenge.\n\n[Choice: Thank the instructor]\n[Choice: Leave quietly]",

She's tidying up the front of the class area, cleaning everything up for future classes. \n\n\"Hi, Ms. Delaney,\" you say, a hint of awkwardness in your voice. \"I just wanted to say thank you for the class. I didn't realize yoga could be so challenging.\"\n\n\"That's wonderful to hear,\" she laughs softly. \"Yoga is about both physical and mental strength. It takes time and practice.\"\n\n\"It really does, doesn't it?\" you laugh too. \"I've done other workouts a few times but this felt like a whole different experience. I felt focused and relaxed.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what yoga is for,\" she says, a warm smile growing on her face. \"I notice you're new here. If you enjoyed today's class, you're welcome to join us again. We meet every Saturday at this time.\"\n\nYou consider it, feeling oddly drawn to the idea. Ms. Delaney's encouragement is genuine, and there's something appealing about returning for more. You realize that maybe you can use this time each week to clear your mind.\n\n\"I'll think about it, thanks,\" you say.\n\n\"Just remember each practice builds on the last,\" she says before you leave. \"It's about progress, not perfection.\"\n\nAs you walk away, you're glad you decided to join this yoga class.\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

Your dad is hunched over by the old wooden gate, toolbox open beside him. he has a screwdriver in one hand and a fierce look of concentration on his face. \n\n\"Oh, [name],\" he says, sounding a little surprised as he notices you. \"Do you need something?\"\n\n\"No, I wanted to help, actually,\" you respond, nervous now that you're actually out here. \"It seemed you were having a tough time, so I wanted to ask if I could do anything.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course you can help!\" your dad interrupts, a wide grin on his face. You haven't seen him look so happy in a long time, and his enthusiasm brings a smile to your face as well. He hands you a screwdriver and starts giving directions. \"Here, you can start with the lower hinge. It's loose, and I could use an extra set of hands.\"\n\nYou two work together, your dad talking you through the process of tightening the screws, aligning the hinge, and checking the balance.

I would appreciate it though.\"\n\n \"Yeah, sounds like a dream job,\" you snort.\n\n The two of you share a quiet laugh, and any tension still lingering melts away.\n\n \"Alright, I think this gate should finally stop squeaking every time we open it,\" your dad tests the gate, a faint smile appearing on his face as it moves smoothly. \"Good work, partner.\"\n\n \"Partner?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow. \"Don't push it, Dad.\"\n\n \"Fine, assistant it is,\" your dad retorts, laughing as he packs up the toolbox and heads toward the house. \n\n You follow him, and you can't help but be a little happy that you spent some quality time with your dad. You don't have a ton of memories with him, but you can already tell you'll remember this one for years to come. Your dad pops open the fridge and hands you a cold soda.\n\n \"Oh, what's this?\" you ask, looking at the red can.\n\n \"You're a little young for a beer, so this is the best you'll get,\" your dad chuckles, patting your back. \"Thanks for helping out.\"\n\n \n \n \"So, how were things like with Grandpa?\" you say after a moment of hesitation. Your dad is far too adept at this, and he tightens a bolt like he's done it a thousand times before.\n\n \"Grandpa was always tinkering around the house,\" your dad looks out across the yard, his eyes seeming to focus on a distant memory. \"I used to be his assistant for everything, just like you're doing right now.\"\n\n \"Are you trying to recruit me?\" you ask, raising your eyebrows.\n\n \"No, don't worry,\" your dad chuckles. \"I want you to do what you enjoy doing. But I really did enjoy helping out around the house. Your grandpa always had all these little projects everywhere you went, you couldn't take a few steps without running into some contraption. I was usually just out there holding the tools, getting my hands dirty. He had me wedged under the sink with a flashlight while he taught me. His idea of teaching was more like barking instructions and hoping things would work out though.\"\n\n \"So, how'd you end up getting this good at fixing stuff then?\"\n\n \"Compared to Grandpa, I'm nothing,\" your dad says, the warmth of nostalgia lingering in his voice. \"He wasn't a great teacher, but he loved spending that time with me. I think those were his favorite memories. Just something as simple as the two of us fixing a gate.\"\n\n \"It must have been nice to spend time with him like that,\" you say, feeling the breeze shift gently around the two of you.\n\n \"Yeah, I didn't realize it at the time though,\" your dad nods slowly. \"But looking back, those were some of the best memories I had with him. Those afternoons felt endless like we had all the time in the world. I'd do anything to go back to one of those days, even just for a few minutes.\"\n\n There's a pause as you look at the gate in front of you. You can sense something in your dad you hadn't seen before though. A kind of longing, a deep respect for those few specks of time when everything made sense.\n\n \"I know I've missed a lot of that with you, [name],\" your dad with quiet sincerity in his voice. \"I'm not perfect. I'm not even decent. Work kept me busy, and I got distracted. Much more distracted than I should have.\"\n\n \"You're here now, Dad,\" you whisper.\n\n \"Thanks, [name],\" your dad's gaze softens as he claps a hand on your shoulder. He lightly squeezes it as he looks into your eyes, his gaze saying everything. \"It means a lot to me that you decided to come out here and spend some time with me today. Grandpa would've been proud of you, you know that, right?\"\n\n \"Thanks, Dad,\" you say, a lump forming in your throat. The words hit you harder than you expected. \n\n The two of you finish up the gate, working together in a comfortable silence. The project is just a gate in the backyard, but to you, it feels more like a bridge. It's more than just a squeaky hinge, it's a shared memory to look back on.\n\n \n \n You look down at the ground, taking a moment to think. After a few moments, you speak up.\n\n \"You know, Dad,\" you begin, glancing up to gauge your father's reaction. \"I know work is important, and I get that you do what you do to take care of us, but sometimes it feels like you haven't really been here.\"\n\n Your dad stops tightening a screw and looks at you, his expression surprised. You take a deep breath and continue.\n\n \"Like, I don't even know what to expect when you're home,\" you say, trying to keep the frustration that's been boiling inside of you for so long from bubbling over. \"I don't really know who you are, and I especially feel like you don't really know me. It makes things complicated for me, not to mention for Lily.\"\n\n \"I'm sorry, [name],\" your dad says quietly, his voice thick with regret. He takes a slow breath, his brows drawn together as he processes what you just said. \"I didn't realize it had gotten that bad. I know I've been gone a lot, but I convinced myself that as long as I was providing, it was enough. That financial stability was the most important thing. But I realized it wasn't enough, not nearly so. That's on me.\"\n\n \"It just sucks sometimes,\" you sigh. You're glad your dad isn't brushing it off or making excuses, but words just spill out of your mouth. \"There were things I wanted to talk to you about, things I wanted to show you. Even when I had a bad day at school, I always wished I had my dad to talk to. I missed having you here.\"\n\n \"I'm sorry I missed so much,\" his face softens, guilt crossing his features. \"I thought I was doing what was best for the family, but maybe I was just hiding behind work. I apologize, [name]. I'm truly sorry.\"\n\n \"Will things change?\" you ask, your voice quiet.\n\n \"Yes, they will,\" your father says, a new determination in his eyes. \"I'm going to do my best to change. I want to be really present with you, with Lily, with your mother. I don't want to miss out anymore. I know you're already an adult now, and I know that you're well on your way to leaving the nest. But let's make this last year a good one.\"\n\n You nod, feeling a weight lift off your chest. Your dad's words don't fix everything, but they are a very good start to repairing the fractured relationship the two of you share. There's a new understanding as you finish working on the gate, side by side.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

I couldn't even get any sleep before freshman year, I was freaking out about everything. What if I got lost? What if my teachers hated me? What if I embarrassed myself in front of everyone? I think everyone feels that way, no matter how confident they might appear.\"\n\n \"Really?\" she asks, her eyes widening slightly. \"I always thought you just walked in and dealt with it.\"\n\n \"I wish it was as easy as you make it seem,\" you say, giving her a reassuring nudge with your shoulder. \"I think that's the thing about high school, though. You're not supposed to have it figured out when you start. Some people say you need to know what major you want to go into and have everything planned out from the get-go, but that's nonsense. Even in college, almost everyone changes their major at least once. It's a process, Lily.\"\n\n \"You're right,\" Lily processes what you just said. \"But I'm just worried I'll make a bad impression or something. What if people think I'm weird?\"\n\n \"Lily, you're going to make friends,\" you laugh softly, shaking your head. \"Yeah, maybe you'll have a few awkward moments, but everyone does. You'll find people who get you, and those are the friends that matter.\"\n\n \"I just hate not knowing what to expect,\" Lily says, a hint of nervousness still in her voice.\n\n \"High school is full of surprises, trust me I know,\" you say, shrugging. \"Some of it's weird, and some of it's great. The nerves though, they go away. After a while, you get used to it, and suddenly you're just living it.\"\n\n \"Thanks, [name],\" Lily smiles, her shoulders relaxing. \"I didn't know you went through all that too.\n\n \"What's family for, huh?\" you ask, grinning. \"If you ever need advice or want to know of some embarrassing stuff I did in freshman year, I'm always here.\"\n\n \"Didn't have to tell me, I knew you were embarrassing,\" Lily snorts, her usual personality returning. She leans into you though, a rare show of affection.\n\n The two of you sit in comfortable silence, and you realize your little sister really is growing up. You hope that your reassurance will make her transition to high school a little bit easier when the time comes.\n\n \n \n You glance at the notebook in Lily's hands, noticing the dense page of notes she's working on. You shift a bit closer to her, reaching out to look over her shoulder.\n\n \"I felt nervous before high school, but I feel learning how to study efficiently is the key to doing well,\" you begin, pointing at her page. \"It looks like you're putting in some serious effort, but you don't need to study everything at once.\"\n\n \"That's easy for you to say, you're already in your senior year,\" she frowns, looking up from her notebook with some skepticism. \"I don't want to fall behind on anything.\"\n\n \"I get it, but you need to be smart with how you study, especially for some of the more difficult classes,\" you say, taking her notebook and flipping through her notes. \"Try and take a break every now and then. Studying in shorter bursts is way more effective than doing it in one go. I think a five-minute break every twenty-five minutes is good.\"\n\n \"Five minutes doesn't sound like much of a break,\" Lily makes a face, clearly intrigued.\n\n \"It sounds short, but it actually keeps you from burning out,\" you explain. \"Not to mention it makes studying feel way less like a marathon. Also, when you take notes, try breaking things down into bullet points instead of full sentences. It's a lot easier to remember that way.\"\n\n Lily looks down at her notes, where she has long paragraphs on each topic. \"Okay, that makes sense,\" she nods, thoughtfully going over what you're saying. \"Anything else?\"\n\n \"For the stuff that's really hard to remember, I make flashcards. They're actually a lifesaver, you can quiz yourself, and it makes the stuff stick in your head better. It really makes the stuff stick in your head better. Plus, you can quiz yourself or if you have a friend you can quiz each other.\"\n\n \"I thought flashcards were for little kids learning words,\" her face crunches as she tries to envision it.\n\n \"Hey, they're really useful, don't knock them,\" you say with a grin. \"They've saved me more times than I can count. Speaking of friends, try and form a study group. You can share notes and your friends can point out things you missed.\"\n\n \"Alright, alright, I'll try these,\" she considers, nodding. \"If it doesn't work and I flunk out of high school though, I'm blaming you.\"\n\n \"Hey, my tips are the best, they'll help a ton,\" you laugh.\n\n \"Whatever you say,\" Lily says with a smirk on her face, some of her worries eased away. \n\n \"You're going to do great, Lily,\" you pat her on the shoulder. \n\n \n \"Well, I felt a little nervous, but it's really not a big deal,\" you shrug. \"You'll probably end up napping through half of it anyway.\"\n\n \"Napping through it?\" Lily frowns, looking up from her notes. \"Seriously?\"\n\n \"I'm just saying it's mostly a bunch of random quizzes, weird food, and teachers yapping about random things for ages. It's really not worth stressing over.\"\n\n \"Yeah, but I don't want to mess it up,\" Lily bites her lip, glancing back down at her notes. She's clearly not reassured by your words. \"What if I don't make any friends or I can't keep up with the homework?\"\n\n \"If you can't keep up, just pretend you're too cool for it,\" you say, waving a hand dismissively. \"Besides, you're pretty smart.\"\n\n \"I don't think I want to be too cool for school, [name],\" Lily looks at you, her frown only growing deeper. \"I actually care a lot about this, you know.\"\n\n \"Just don't overthink it,\" you give a small, awkward laugh.\n\n \"Yeah, thanks, I guess,\" she sighs, pulling her notebook a little closer. \"I just thought you'd have some actual advice.\"\n\n You feel a pang of regret, realizing you may have misread the moment.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

You end up sneaking spoonfuls of cookie dough and chocolate chips though.\n\n\"We won't have enough for the actual cookies,\" your mom laughs as she swats your hand away. \"Be careful.\"\n\n\"They're so good though,\" you say with cookie dough in your mouth.\n\nAs the two of you bake, your mom shares little stories. She talks about how she learned her favorite cookie recipe from her own mother, and how she almost set the kitchen on fire the first time she tried to make it. You find yourself relaxing, feeling a connection with your mom that you sometimes miss.\n\nOnce the cookies are in the oven, you have a moment to finally rest and chat with your mom. \n\n[Choice: Ask about old family recipes]\n[Choice: Jokingly ask if she's a master at baking]\n[Choice: Thank her for everything she's done for you]",

The kitchen feels cozy, the warmth of the oven mixing with the smell of chocolate. \n\n \"Hey, Mom,\" you start, a hint of curiosity in your voice. \"Do we have any other family recipes?\"\n\n Your mom pauses, looking up from the tray of cookies. Her eyes soften as she takes a moment to reflect, a fond smile growing across her face.\n\n \"Well, there's the apple pie recipe that my mom used to make every fall,\" your mom begins. \"I was so curious as to what the secret ingredient was.\"\n\n \"So, what was the secret ingredient?\" you ask, tilting your head.\n\n \"Cinnamon,\" your mom can't help but smile. \"Your grandpa also used to make this stew that was just amazing. It was a bunch of random ingredients, but it all came together to make something special. I've tried to recreate it but it doesn't taste quite the same. If you're interested in making it, I could try and find the recipe.\"\n\n \"That actually sounds really nice,\" you lean back a little, intrigued by the idea of learning more about your family's culinary roots.\n\n \"You know, we could make it into a family thing, if you'd like,\" your mom laughs gently, a wistful look in her eyes. \"Maybe next weekend we'll do something together. It's nice to share a moment like that.\"\n\n You smile, feeling a sense of connection with your family's past. \n\n \"I'd like that,\" you whisper. \n\n \"Just say the word, and we'll make it happen,\" your mom nods. \"If you ever want to learn any of my other recipes, let me know.\"\n\n \n You glance at your mom rolling the cookie dough and arranging it on the tray. It's a familiar motion, and you can tell she's done it a ton in the past. \"So, you're kind of a master at baking, huh?\" you ask, chuckling.\n\n \"I wouldn't call myself a master,\" she looks up and laughs. \"I'm not a bad baker though, I'll give myself that.\"\n\n \"You always make it look so easy though,\" you say, a skeptical look crossing your face. \"Lily and I tried to make cookies once, and it was a disaster.\"\n\n \"You don't have to tell me,\" your mom shakes her head, although there's a hint of a smile on her face. \"I remember the two of you left the mess for me to clean up.\"\n\n \"Oops, sorry,\" you apologize.\n\n \"Don't worry, you have to practice to learn. My first few attempts at making cookies weren't good at all, trust me. My mom, your grandma, got angry after I burnt all of them. The oven smelled like burnt chocolate and dough for weeks.\"\n\n \"Wait, so you're telling me you weren't born with your baking skills?\" you tease. You can't imagine your mom, who always seems to be put-together in the kitchen, doing that.\n\n \"Not at all, did you listen to anything I just said?\" she tousles your hair. \"Your grandma always told me I'd figure it out one day. Look at me now, she was right.\"\n\n \"Maybe one day I'll become a master baker too,\" you murmur.\n\n \"We can always make this a regular thing, if you want,\" your mom winks at you. \"I can pass down all the Yoon family secrets to you.\"\n\n \n You glance over at your mom, who's rolling the cookie dough and arranging it on the tray. She hums softly to yourself, and you feel a sense of gratitude. She's always been busy, and you're sure she's had a lot of personal issues she hasn't told you. \n\n \"Hey, Mom,\" you say, leaning against the counter. \"Thank you for doing this with me, and for everything you've done for me in general.\" \n\n Your mom pauses, surprised by your sincere tone. A soft smile crosses her face and her eyes water up a little.\n\n \"Oh, [name],\" her voice trembles slightly. \"You don't have to thank me for that, I'm just doing what a mother should. Spending time with you is as much for me as it is for you.\"\n\n \"I guess,\" you murmur. \"It's just, I know raising a kid isn't easy and you've always done your best. I've never felt unloved or anything before. I guess I realized I should say thank you.\"\n\n \"Thank you,\" your mom says, pulling you into a tight hug. After a few seconds, she pulls back, staring at you. \"You're all grown up now, aren't you?\"\n \n\nYou feel a warmth swelling in you at her words, and you know that these small, intimate moments carry a lot of meaning. The conversation drifts back to lighthearted chatting as the cookies bake, but you feel like there's a whole new world of memories waiting to be uncovered now. \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

The wait is long, but after what feels like forever, you finally reach the front of the line.\n\nA ride operator gestures for you to step forward, and you and your friends file into the capsule. The door clicks shut behind you, locking the three of you inside the small glass-enclosed space.\n\n\"Let's go!\" you exclaim, pumping your fist into the air.\n\n\"Someone's excited,\" Samantha remarks, raising an eyebrow. \"But yeah, I think it'll be fun. Well... as fun as a Ferris wheel can be.\"\n\nLuke grins. \"Hey, sometimes simple things are the best.\"\n\nThe ride jerks slightly as it starts moving, lifting you all into the sky with a steady rhythm. The sounds of the festival—laughter, game booths, the distant hum of music—grow quieter as the capsule rises above the ground. The higher you go, the more the festival spreads out below you in a dazzling display of glowing lights and autumn colors. Beyond the fairgrounds, Crestview Bay stretches out in the distance, bathed in sunlight.\n\nBy the time you reach the peak, the view is breathtaking.\n\nSamantha leans against the glass, peering down at the scenery. \"Okay, I've got to admit it. This is pretty cool.\"\n\nYou nod, taking it all in. From up here, the festival looks almost surreal—tiny figures moving between booths, the racetrack and archery range barely visible from this height. The entire town feels so small from this perspective, like you could reach out and touch the rooftops below.\n\nLuke exhales, his eyes lingering on the sight before him. \"It's a shame this is all going to end soon.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" you ask, glancing at him.\n\nHe shakes his head. \"After this year, we're all gonna go off to college or something. No matter what we do, we'll start drifting apart.\"\n\n\"Jesus, Luke,\" Samantha says, scoffing. \"You're acting like we're all about to die or something.\"\n\nLuke lets out a quiet laugh, but the usual brightness in his expression is muted. \"I just mean... it won't be the same, you know? We've been friends for years, but once life pulls us in different directions...\" He trails off, his gaze lowering to the festival below.\n\nSilence settles over the capsule, the weight of his words sinking it.\n\nYou don't want to admit it, but he's probably right. You, Luke, and Samantha have been inseparable for so long—years of inside jokes, late-night study sessions, and lazy weekends filled with movies and pizza. People do drift apart, no matter how much they promise to keep in touch. It's just... life.\n\nThe Ferris wheel begins its slow descent, bringing you back down toward reality.\n\nYou shake your head and force a smile. \"Hey, come on. We'll figure it out. I mean, we're not just gonna stop being friends overnight.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" Samantha murmurs, biting her lip as she looks out the window again.\n\nA minute later, the capsule reaches the bottom, and the door unlock with a soft click. You and your friends step out, back into the warmth and noise of the festival.\n\nYou take a deep breath, pushing away the lingering weight of the conversation.\n\nToday is supposed to be a happy day.\n\n[Choice: Choose where to go next]",

The booth is small but decorated with colorful, glowing strips of light, adding to the festival's cozy atmosphere.\n\n\"Hmm... let's do four pictures,\" she decides. \"Oh, wait—it's starting already?\"\n\n\"Already?!\" Luke blurts out, his eyes widening as he suddenly realizes what's happening. \"What do I do with my face?\"\n\nSamantha rolls her eyes. \"Dude, it's not that complicated. Just stand there and smile like a normal human being.\" She positions herself on the right, tilting her head slightly as she flashes a bright, picture-perfect grin. \"Come on, you two! The first shot's coming up in a few seconds.\"\n\nLuke scrambles to the left, hurriedly pasting on a huge grin that looks way too enthusiastic. You step into the middle, doing your best to force a natural smile onto your face. It doesn't quite work. Smiling on command has never been your strong suit, but whatever—the camera beeps, and the first photo is taken.\n\nAs soon as the screen displays the preview, Luke immediately relaxes, his grin vanishing. \"Okay, what's next?\"\n\nSamantha tips her chin thoughtfully. \"Hmm... let's all wink this time. It's fun, but not too ridiculous.\"\n\n\"I don't know, I suck at winking,\" you say, hesitating.\n\nTo prove your point, you attempt one, but instead of a smooth wink, you just end up blinking awkwardly.\n\nLuke bursts into laughter. \"Oh, come on, [name]. Just close one eye. You've got like five seconds.\"\n\nYou try again, struggling for a moment before finally managing a barely passable wink right as the camera snaps. The result appears on the screen, and to your surprise, it actually looks decent.\n\n\"Not bad,\" Samantha admits. \"Now, what's next?\"\n\nShe looks at Luke, giving him the chance to choose. He pauses and rubs his chin with exaggerated thought before a slow, devious grin spreads across his face.\n\n\"Alright, flex your muscles!\" he declares, rolling up his left sleeve and striking the most dramatic bodybuilder pose he can manage.\n\nYou and Samantha both stare at him, unimpressed.\n\n\"Bruh,\" Samantha deadpans.\n\n\"What?

Samantha half-heartedly joins in, rolling her eyes as she strikes an exaggerated pose next to you. The camera flashes, capturing the moment forever in digital memory.\n\n\"And now, for our grand finale,\" Samantha says, turning to you. \"What's our final pose, [name]?\"\n\n[Choice: Do a manly pose]\n[Choice: Do a girly pose]\n[Choice: Do bunny ears on Luke]\n[Choice: Do bunny ears on Samantha]",

The playful energy in the booth is contagious, and just as the machine beeps, you all lean in slightly to lock in the perfect goofy pose.\n\n \n \n \n \n \"Let's do bunny ears on each other,\" you suggest, already lifting your fingers behind Samantha's head. \"I'll do Samantha.\"\n\n She lets out a short laugh and shakes her head. \"Had to choose me, huh?\" Her smirk is teasing, but she doesn't seem to mind. \"Fine, then I'll do bunny ears on Luke, and Luke can get you.\"\n\n \"Classic,\" Luke says, grinning. \"Alright, let's do it.\"\n\n The three of you shift into position, fingers lifted behind each other's heads, forming a perfect loop of playful sabotage. You all flash bright smiles, the mood light and easy.\n \n\nJust as you all settle into position, the photo booth beeps. A bright flash fills the small space, followed by the familiar snap of the camera capturing the moment.\n\nA second later, the screen flickers, and the little animated bear from before reappears. It wiggles happily as it processes the photos. A mechanical hum sounds from the slot below, and your photos slide out, freshly printed and glossy.\n\nSamantha grabs them first, flipping through them with a smirk. \"Alright, one for you, one for you, and one for me,\" she says, handing them out.\n\nShe looks down at the final strip in her hands, her smile softening just a little. Then, without warning, she pulls both you and Luke into a tight, almost bone-crushing hug.\n\n\"To our senior year,\" she says, voice warm but firm.\n\nLuke lets out a gasp. \"Oh my God, Sam, is this emotion?\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up,\" Samantha groans, although she's still grinning as she squeezes you both even tighter.\n\nYou laugh and shake your head. Moments like this—you'd make sure they lasted.\n\n[Choice: Choose where to go next]",

You did pay 20 dollars for an entry ticket, after all. You were going to get your money's worth.\n\nThe ride itself is tucked away behind a row of brightly lit carnival booths, its entrance framed by a heart-shaped archway outlined in soft lights. A wooden dock leads down to the water, where small, swan-shaped boats bob gently along a slow-moving canal. The tunnel ahead is dimly lit which allows warm golden lights to cast shimmering reflections on the water. Somewhere inside, the distant melody of a romantic song drifts through the air.\n\nAs the three of you step closer, Samantha suddenly pauses.\n\n\"There's only space for two people per boat,\" she says, shifting her weight. \"So... who's riding?\"\n\nLuke and Samantha exchange glances, a silent conversation playing out between them before they turn toward you in unison.\n\n\"Well,\" Samantha says, tilting her head with a smirk, \"you're the one who suggested we check out the Tunnel of Love, so you're definitely going on the ride, [name].\"\n\nYou glance at the swan boats drifting past, then back at her. \"Are you seriously going to make me ride this alone?\"\n\n\"Oh no, you won't be alone, don't worry,\" she replies, her grin widening. \"You just have to pick who's riding with you.\"\n\nLuke laughs, casually resting his arms on the railing. \"I really don't mind,\" he says, shooting you an easygoing smile. \"It's just a festival ride, not a marriage proposal.\"\n\nSamantha shrugs. \"Yeah, I don't care either. Your call, bro.\"\n\nYou hesitate for a moment, glancing between them as the next boat approaches the dock.\n\nWho are you going to ride with?\n\n[Choice: Go with Luke]\n[Choice: Go with Samantha]",

The boat rocks slightly beneath you, but right before you lose your balance, Luke places a firm hand on your shoulder to steady you. You mumble a quick thanks as you scoot into place. He hops in right after, sliding into the seat beside you. Your elbow brushes against his chest, and for some reason, you feel your face heat up a little.\n\nBefore you can say anything, Samantha bursts into laughter. \"Look, don't be mad, but you two look like gay lovers!\" she teases, whipping out her phone before either of you can protest. The camera shutter clicks loudly as she snaps a picture. \"I have to post this on Insta.\"\n\n\"Fuck off, Sam,\" you say, rolling your eyes. But despite yourself, you can't help but crack a small smile at her antics.\n\nLuke just chuckles, shaking his head. \"Come on, [name],\" he nudges you lightly, pointing toward the ride operator. \"It looks like we're about to start.\"\n\n\"Bye, lovebirds!\" Samantha calls, waving as the boat begins to drift forward into the tunnel.\n\nAs soon as you enter the tunnel, the dim lighting shifts to a warm, dreamy glow. The tunnel walls are decorated with heart-shaped lights and tiny cherub statues holding bows, ready to strike riders with imaginary love arrows. The air is filled with soft, romantic music—something slow and melodic, the kind of song that would play in an old black-and-white film when the leads finally confess their feelings.\n\nYou lean back slightly, exhaling as you take it all in. Glancing over at Luke, you realize his features are easy to make out even in the dark. His strong jawline, the way his ginger curls falls just a little messily over his forehead, and his broad shoulders from years of football. Despite all that though, he doesn't carry himself like one of the typical jocks. He's always been your Luke—the same guy who used to get excited over fantasy novels and superhero comics with you and Samantha back when none of you were even remotely cool.\n\nHe easily could have ditched the both of you to hang out with the football team, but he never did. Even when his popularity rose, even when people started noticing him more, he stayed right here. Your friend.\n\nFor some reason, that thought lingers a lot longer than it should.\n\n\"Heh, it's a little awkward,\" you say, rubbing the back of your neck. \"Maybe we should've skipped this one.\"\n\nLuke raises an eyebrow. \"Aren't you the one who wanted to come here?\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't think it'd be this romantic,\" you mutter, gesturing to the flashing pink hearts. \"This is definitely for couples.\"\n\nLuke shrugs, completely unfazed. \"Meh, I don't mind. You're one of my closest friends, [name]. Can't avoid a little awkwardness sometimes.\"\n\nYou're caught off guard by his sincerity. There's no teasing or discomfort, just Luke being Luke. He's the kind of guy who makes people feel safe just by existing.\n\nYou nod slowly, appreciating his words more than you expected.\n\nThe rest of the ride continues in a comfortable silence, the boat gliding gently along the winding waterway. Neither of you says anything, but it doesn't feel weird.\n\nThe tunnel's exit finally comes back into view, and the boat drifts back toward the dock. As you approach, you spot Samantha waiting for you with her phone still in hand, an absolutely devious smirk plastered on her face.\n\n\"So,\" she says, barely able to contain her laughter, \"who's the top and who's the bottom?\"\n\n[Choice: Choose where to go next]",

She settles into the seat with an exaggerated sigh, making a show of how positively thrilled she is to be here. Once she's in place, you hop in too, doing your best to not get wet in the process.\n\n\"Have fun, you two,\" Luke calls out, smirking as he waves at you from the dock. \"Do your best to not fall in love.\"\n\n\"Fuck off, Luke,\" Samantha shoots back as the boat begins to drift forward into the tunnel.\n\nAs soon as you enter the tunnel, the dim lighting shifts to a warm, dreamy glow.

You've never really thought about your best friend in that way, but you have to admit—she's pretty cute.\n\nStill, that kind of thing would be weird, right? You've been friends for way too long to suddenly see her differently now.\n\n\"Heh, it's a little awkward,\" you say, rubbing the back of your neck. \"Maybe we should've skipped this one.\"\n\nSamantha lets out a short laugh. \"Hey, you're the one who wanted to come here, not me.

You guys are my best friends.\"\n\nHer tone is casual, but there's a rare softness underneath it—one that she doesn't show often.

Your head throbs and your limbs feel heavy. A groan escapes your lips as you try to piece together what's happening.\n\nThe last thing you remember is Madame Serena, her piercing gaze, the way her voice wrapped around your thoughts like a lingering echo. The memory sends a shiver down your spine.\n\nYour eyes flutter open, and the blurred shapes hovering above you sharpen into familiar faces—Samantha, Luke, your mom, and your little sister, Lily, all watching you with varying degrees of concern. The warm glow of your living room lamp replaces the flickering candlelight of the fortune teller's tent. You're not at the festival anymore. You're on the couch in your own home.\n\n\"You good, [name]?\" Lily asks, tilting her head as she pokes your arm, her usual smirk missing for once. There's an uncharacteristic softness in her voice, almost like she's actually worried about you.\n\nThen, just as quickly, she ruins it.\n\n\"You better be okay! I don't wanna go to your funeral and have to stare at your ugly photo all day!\"\n\nThere it is. The real Lily.\n\n\"Come on, Lily, be nice,\" your mom sighs, rubbing her temples. She looks exhausted, like she's been worrying for hours. \"I was terrified when I got a call from your friends saying you passed out at the festival. What happened?\"\n\nYou sit up slowly, still feeling lightheaded, your mind scrambling to put the pieces together. The tent. Madame Serena. The tarot cards. You remember the way her voice dropped, the strange weight that pulled at you, and then... nothing.\n\n\"I swear, she said something weird,\" you murmur, your voice still groggy. \"I—I think she cursed me or something.\"\n\nLuke frowns, exchanging a quick glance with Samantha before shaking his head. \"Dude... we went back into the tent after you didn't come out.\" His voice drops slightly like he's still trying to process it himself. \"It was empty.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, empty?\" you ask, blinking.\n\n\"The whole setup was gone,\" Samantha clarifies, crossing her arms. \"There was a tent, but inside? No table, no candles, no seer. Just... nothing. Like no one had been in there at all.\"\n\nThat doesn't make any sense. You were just in there, sitting across from her, watching her flip those cursed tarot cards. It was real. It had to be real.\n\n\"No, wait, I have proof!\" Panic surges through you as you scramble for your phone, flipping to your camera roll. If you really recorded everything, then—\n\nYou stop.\n\nThe screen stares back at you, perfectly normal. The last image in your Photos app is from earlier—a copy of the photo booth pictures with Luke and Samantha that you captured.\n\nNo recording.\n\nNo video.\n\nNo proof.\n\nYour stomach drops.\n\n\"What?\" you whisper, scrolling frantically, fingers swiping through your gallery in desperation. But there's nothing. No footage of Madame Serena, no trace of the tarot reading, nothing but the festival photos you remember taking before any of this happened.\n\nLily snickers from beside you, shaking her head. \"Yep. He's lost it.\" She leans over and gives you a light punch on the arm, grinning. \"Welcome back to reality.\"\n\nYour mom sighs, stepping closer. \"Alright, let's get you to your room.\" She gently grasps your arm and helps you off the couch, her touch firm but careful. Then she turns to Luke and Samantha, offering them a tired but grateful look. \"Thank you for calling me and making sure he got home. I'll take it from here.\"\n\nSamantha stretches her arms above her head, stifling a yawn. \"No problem, Mrs. Yoon. See you at school tomorrow, [name]. Try not to pass out again, yeah?\"\n\n\"Yeah, man.

You weren't the worst student, but you weren't exactly excelling.

You could get into a good university, have an easier future, be set for life. But the issue was always the same—time. Between school, friends, distractions, and now... whatever the hell this was, how were you supposed to find time to actually study?\n\n Your mind drifts back to Madame Serena. The missing recording. The empty tent. That creeping sense of unease that still hadn't quite left you.\n\n You shake your head, forcing yourself to refocus. No. Not now.\n\n Hours pass as you grind through problem sets, reread passages, and try to make sense of concepts that always seem out of reach. Eventually, exhaustion starts to creep in.\n\n You stretch your arms above your head, letting out a long, groggy groan. That's enough for today. Classes hadn't even officially started yet—you weren't about to waste that much energy studying material that might not even show up.\n\n Leaning back in your chair, you glance at the clock. It's late. Maybe now you can finally relax.\n\n \n You pull up Google and type in the name:\n\n Madame Serena fortune teller Crestview Bay Autumn Festival.\n\n The results are underwhelming. There's no official website, no social media presence—just a handful of blog posts from festival-goers recounting their experiences.

Madame Serena gave me a great fortune—she predicted I'd land my dream job, and two years later, I did!\"\n\n \"She told me to trust myself, and honestly? Best advice I ever got. Would definitely recommend getting a reading if she's there next year.\"\n\n \"Creepy but cool! Her tent has such a vibe, 10/10.\"\n\n You groan. Nobody else mentions anything weird happening. No talk of passing out, no strange feeling, no vanishing recordings—nothing that even remotely resembles what happened to you.\n\n For the next few hours, you dig deeper, searching for anything more obscure—old mentions of her name, discussions on niche forums, local news articles—but there's nothing substantial.\n\n Eventually, you sigh and lean back in your chair, rubbing your eyes. It's no use. You've hit a dead end.\n\n You jot down a mental memo—you'll go back to the Autumn Festival and try to get some information from the people running it. Someone has to know who she is and how to contact her.\n\n For now, though, you shut down your computer, pushing the unsettling thoughts to the back of your mind.\n \n\n[Choice: Get ready for bed]",

You can't quite put your finger on it, but the feeling lingers, refusing to be ignored.\n\nYou ignore it and splash cold water on your face, letting the chill shock you back into clarity. Droplets cling to your skin as you straighten up and glance at yourself in the mirror.\n\nYour stomach clenches.\n\nAt first glance, everything looks normal—same face, same messy black hair, same tired eyes staring back at you. But as you lean in, tilting your head slightly, unease creeps up your spine.\n\nSomething is different.\n\nYou scan your reflection carefully, eyes darting across every familiar feature. Your nose, your jawline, the slight bags under your eyes—nothing has changed. And yet, something feels off.\n\nThen, it clicks.\n\nYour eyes.\n\nThey're... bigger. Rounder.\n\nIt's not a huge change, nothing dramatic or obvious, but it's enough for you to see it. Your eyes have always been sharp, a little narrow, but now they seem softer—more open, almost like they belong to someone else.\n\nYour breath hitches as your mind flashes back to Madame Serena's words.\n\n\"To see yourself fully, you must first experience the other side of that reflection.\"\n\nYou grip the edge of your sink, fingers pressing into the cold porcelain as your pulse quickens. No. This is ridiculous. Maybe you're just tired. Maybe it's the lighting.

Your arms, your torso, your legs—everything is the same. No sudden curves, no changes in height, and, most importantly, nothing missing or altered where it really counts.\n\nYou exhale, somewhat reassured.\n\nMaybe you really are overthinking this.\n\nAfter rinsing off, you step out of the shower and grab a towel, drying yourself off before moving to the sink again. Your reflection is still waiting for you, but this time, you force yourself to ignore it as you go through your usual routine.\n\nOnce you're done, you pull on your pajamas—soft plaid pants and an oversized long-sleeved shirt. Comfortable and familiar. Something to help you feel normal again.\n\nAnd yet, as you crawl into bed and stare at the ceiling, your mind refuses to settle.\n\nNo matter how much you try and brush it off, the image of your slightly altered reflection lingers in your thoughts.\n\nMaybe it's nothing. Maybe it's just exhaustion.\n\nBut the thought lingers.\n\nAnd as sleep finally pulls you under, one last question echoes in the back of your mind.\n\nWhat if this is just the beginning?\n\n[Choice: Fall asleep]",

      "text": "\"You won't believe what I just saw—a horrifying monster,\" you announce, struggling to keep a straight face.\n\n Samantha gives you a skeptical look, arms crossed over her chest. \"Oh yeah? What kind of monster, huh?\"\n\n You hum thoughtfully, drawing out the suspense. \"Let's see here. She was about average height and had tan skin and wavy black hair. Oh, and she was wearing a black T-shirt with an anime girl pointing up at the sky.\"\n\n Samantha's eyes narrow as she listens. Then, as if on cue, she glances down at her own outfit—a black T-shirt with an anime girl. A beat of silence. Then, her expression shifts from confusion to realization.\n\n \"Oh, fuck off,\" she groans, rolling her eyes before jabbing you in the ribs with her elbow. \"You're talking about me, aren't you?\"\n\n You let out a laugh, finally unable to contain yourself.\n\n \"For your information,\" she continues. \"I am not horrifying. I am a goddamn delight.\"\n\n \n \n \n \"I'm good, I just had a flashback to physics last year,\" you say. \"It was that bad. Honestly, I think it traumatized me.\"\n \n Samantha groans dramatically, rubbing her temples as if just thinking about it gave her a headache. \"Oh God, Mr. Trent and his bullshit. Like, yeah, sure, let me just casually understand quantum mechanics while you scribble an equation on the board. The worst part is when he stared at us like we were the problem.\"\n\n You nod solemnly. \"The way he would pause after explaining something, like he was waiting for us to be enlightened? The man had more faith in us than he should have.\"\n\n \"Oh, don't forget the tests,\" Samantha adds, her voice dripping with exasperation. \"We'd spend weeks on momentum, but then—boom—half the test is on circuits. Like, how the hell were we supposed to know?\"\n\n You shake your head. \"The real horror story isn't ghosts or monsters—it's walking into a class and realizing you forgot there was a quiz.\"\n\n Samantha clutches her chest dramatically. \"Stop, I can still feel that panic.\"\n \n\nLuke cuts in, his voice carrying a casual excitement. \"Anyway, I wanted to suggest something.\"\n\nHe shifts his backpack higher onto his shoulder and picks up the pace slightly, stepping ahead of you and Samantha before turning to face you both, walking backward with an easy grin.\n\n\"We should hit up the local Autumn Festival after school today,\" he says, his hands slipping into the pockets of his hoodie. \"You know, start the year off right. Food stalls, games, rides. It'll be fun.\"\n\nYou hesitate for a moment, shifting the strap of your bag on your shoulder, then glance at Samantha.\n\nShe's already looking at you, amusement flickering in her green eyes. A slow, knowing smile spreads across her lips, and she tilts her head just slightly. \"Sounds like a good idea, doesn't it, [name]?\"\n\nThere's something in her tone that suggests she already knows your answer.\n\n[Choice: Hell yeah!]",

Instead, the morning is filled with dull introductions—teachers droning on about senior year expectations, college applications, and the usual warnings about keeping up with coursework. It's all very boring, and by the time the equivalent of two class periods have passed, you're more than ready for a break.\n\nWhen the lunch bell finally rings, you and your two closest friends make your way to the cafeteria. The air is filled with the familiar hum of conversation, the occasional burst of laughter echoing from different tables. The three of you claim your usual spot, trays of cafeteria food set in front of you.\n\n\"So, what's the deal with that carnival thing? Or festival, or whatever it is,\" you ask after swallowing a bite of food.\n\n\"Here, take a look,\" Luke says, pulling out his phone. He holds it up in front of your face, the screen glowing with a website.\n\nYou take the phone from his hand and tilt it toward Samantha so the two of you can scan the details together. The website is simple but colorful, advertising an event called the Crestview Bay Autumn Festival. There's a list of attractions—classic fairgrounds, a food stall lineup, and a photo booth. At the bottom, a section labeled Special Attractions catches your eye.\n\n\"A seer?\" Samantha reads aloud, frowning as she peers over your shoulder. Her gaze flickers to the small, grainy image on the screen of a striking woman in her forties with piercing violet eyes, seated behind a crystal ball. \"What, is she gonna tell us our fortunes or something?\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" you say with a shrug. \"Maybe she'll give us a glimpse into our futures.\"\n\n\"Obviously, I'm going to be a rich football star,\" Luke says confidently, grinning as he holds out his hand. \"Now, if you two are done, I'd like my phone back. Can't have you two snooping through my unlocked phone for too long.\"\n\n\"Hmm?\" Samantha's expression shifts into something far more mischievous. Before Luke can react, she swipes the phone out of his hand with a triumphant smirk. \"You want to take a peek, [name]?\"\n\n[Choice: Take a look]\n[Choice: Respect his privacy]",

      "text": "\"Go on, look fast,\" you say, grinning as you brace yourself against the cafeteria table, using one arm to fend off Luke. He's lunging at Samantha, his hands swiping wildly through the air, but she's far too quick, holding his phone just out of reach.\n\n \"Let's see what kind of juicy secrets he's hiding,\" you add, your grin widening as you glance at Samantha.\n\n \"Hey, give me my phone back!\" Luke barks, his voice a mix of panic and frustration. He tries to snatch it again, but Samantha twists her body, keeping it just beyond his grasp.\n\n \"Hold your horses, I want to see what all the fuss is about,\" she says, tapping rapidly at the screen. \"Let's see what we have here...\"\n\n Luke's face is frozen in apprehension, his eyes darting between you and Samantha. You can just tell he's mentally running through every questionable thing on his phone, probably regretting ever pulling it out in the first place.\n\n Then, after a few moments of scrolling, Samantha lets out a dramatic gasp, her eyes going wide.\n\n \"Oh my God, Luke,\" she says, her voice dripping with mock scandal.\n\n Luke's expression instantly shifts to sheer panic. \"What? What is it?!\"\n\n Samantha turns the phone toward you, biting her lip to keep herself from laughing. \"A 10-gigabyte porn folder on his Google Drive,\" she announces, her tone somewhere between amusement and disbelief. \"Completely filled to the brim with Japanese adult videos. Oh my, can you believe it?\"\n\n Luke's entire face turns an alarming shade of red. \"They take a long time to load, so I downloaded them!\" he blurts out, waving his arms as if trying to physically swat the embarrassment away.\n\n You burst out laughing, doubling over slightly as Samantha shakes her head in feigned disappointment.\n\n \"That's... so much porn, Luke,\" you wheeze between laughs.\n\n \"How do you even have that much space?\" Samantha adds, scrolling a little further. \"That's like... several USB sticks worth of porn just sitting in the cloud.\"\n\n Luke groans, burying his face in his hands. \"Can we not talk about this?\"\n\n Samantha hums thoughtfully, still scrolling. \"Well, at least the content's pretty vanilla,\" she says, letting out a loud sigh. \"No weird kinks, no cursed tags. Nothing too exciting, sadly. Kind of a letdown, honestly.\"\n\n She pins the phone in her hand before tossing it back to him.\n\n Luke snatches it mid-air, glaring. \"You guys are the worst.\"\n\n \"You love us,\" you say, grinning as you nudge him with your elbow.\n\n \"Yeah, yeah,\" he grumbles, shoving his phone deep into his pocket like it might erase the last few minutes of his life. He exhales before shifting the conversation to safer ground. \"Anyway, are we going to the Autumn Festival or what?\"\n\n You glance at Samantha who meets your gaze.\n\n \"Eh, why not?\" she says, shrugging.\n\n You shrug back. \"Yeah, it could be fun.\"\n\n Luke leans back, seeming relieved that the topic has finally moved on. \"Great. Then it's settled.\"\n\n Samantha grins. \"Hey, who knows? Maybe the fortune teller will predict your very bright future in the adult film industry.\"\n\n Luke groans loudly as you and Samantha dissolve into laughter once again.\n\n \n \n \n \"I'll be honest, I'm really tempted to,\" you admit, eyeing the phone still in Samantha's grasp. The screen is right there, a treasure trove of things you can blackmail Luke with—but after a brief internal battle, you decide to take the high road. \"But we should respect Luke's privacy.\"\n\n With a reluctant sigh, you reach over and gently take the phone from Samantha before things can escalate.\n\n Samantha groans and dramatically tilts her head back. \"Aww, fine,\" she whines, crossing her arms. \"I guess that's the right thing to do.\"\n\n Luke lets out a sharp exhale, fixing you both with a deadpan stare. \"Yeah, so—give me my phone back before you two get any more ideas.\"\n\n Samantha eyes the phone one last time before you hand it over, but not without shaking her head in disapproval. \"What a waste of potential,\" she mutters. \"I was hoping for something spicy. A scandal, a secret, something.\"\n\n Luke snatches his phone like it's a priceless artifact, shoving it deep into his pocket. \"You guys are not invading my privacy, thanks.\"\n\n Samantha just flashes him a smug grin. \"Oh well. Maybe next time.\"\n\n \"There won't be a next time.\"\n\n Before Samantha can poke at him any further, Luke shakes his head and changes the subject.\n \n \"Anyway,\" he says. \"Are we going to the Autumn Festival or not?\"\n\n You glance at Samantha who meets your eyes with a relaxed shrug.\n\n \"Eh, why not?\" she says.\n\n You mirror the gesture. \"Yeah, sure. Could be fun, I guess.\"\n\n \"Great,\" Luke says, stretching his arms behind his head. \"Then it's settled.\"\n \n\n[Choice: Let's go!]\n[Choice: Change your mind and decide not to go]",

You meet up outside the school, where students are dispersing—some climbing into their cars, others waiting for their rides.\n\n\"Alright, just follow me,\" Luke says, eyes fixed on his phone as he pulls up the directions.\n\nSamantha crosses her arms and lets out a dramatic sigh as she watches a few students drive off. \"Man, what are the chances that none of us have a car? It would be really nice if we didn't have to walk everywhere.\"\n\nLuke raises an eyebrow. \"Well, maybe if someone actually got their license instead of putting it off, we wouldn't be in this situation.\"\n\nSamantha shoots him an unimpressed look. \"Even if I had my license, I still wouldn't have a car. So really, nothing would've changed.\"\n\nLuke huffs. \"Well, you could be driving us around in someone else's car.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I could,\" Samantha says, pretending to think about it. \"But that sounds like a lot of responsibility. So no thanks.\"\n\nYou chuckle as the three of you begin walking. The crisp autumn air carries the scent of fallen leaves and the faint sound of carnival music drifts toward you as you get closer.\n\nA large purple banner with white lettering stretches over the entrance, swaying slightly in the breeze:\n\nCRESTVIEW BAY AUTUMN FESTIVAL\n\nBeyond the entrance, the festival is alive with movement. The scents of fried dough, kettle corn, and caramel apples fills the air, mingling with the cheerful sounds of chatter and distant laughter.\n\nA massive Ferris wheel dominates the skyline, its gondolas rotating against the blue sky. Near the entrance, a small wooden stand houses a photo booth. Further down, a curtained-off attraction labeled Tunnel of Love sits nestled between other festival attractions, its entrance framed by a glowing arch of pink lights.\n\nThe three of you step forward and hand over twenty dollars each, receiving wristbands in exchange. The good news is that once you're inside, all the rides are free.\n\nSamantha takes a deep breath and looks around with an impressed nod. \"This is actually really nice. It's way better than I expected.\"\n\n\"Where should we start?\" Luke asks, scanning the area.\n\nYou glance around at the different attractions before turning to Luke. \"Aren't you the one who planned this whole thing out? What are our options?\"\n\nLuke furrows his brown, taking a few moments to think before speaking. \"Well, there's the Tunnel of Love, which is meant for couples and all that jazz. Then there's the Ferris wheel, obviously.\"\n\n\"Yeah, wow, I totally didn't notice,\" Samantha says, pointing up at the massive Ferris wheel towering over the entire festival. \"That gigantic thing in the middle of everything? How could I possibly have seen that?\"\n\nLuke shoots her an unamused look. \"Okay, okay, geez. I was just listing things.\" He gestures toward the entrance. \"There's also a photo booth over there if you guys want to take pictures.\"\n\nSamantha tilts her head, considering the options. \"I've got to admit, those are all pretty solid choices. But the question is, where do we go first?\"\n\nSamantha and Luke gaze at you expectantly, waiting for your answer as the lively festival buzzes around you.\n\n \n \n \n[Choice: Go to the Tunnel of Love]\n[Choice: Go to the Ferris Wheel]\n[Choice: Go to the photo booth]",

From pumpkin carving to craft stations, there's no shortage of small activities to enjoy. The games are lighthearted, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is lively. But after a while, as the festival starts to wind down and the crowd begins to thin, you realize there's not much left to do.\n\nSamantha stretches, looking around. \"Are we done now?\" she asks, her voice carrying a slight edge of boredom. \"I feel like we've hit everything—photo booth, Ferris wheel, pumpkin bowling...\" She trails off, scanning the fairgrounds as if something new might magically appear.\n\nLuke frowns, pulling out his phone. \"Let me read the website, just to make sure we didn't miss anything.\" He scrolls for a moment, his expression unreadable. Then, he looks up. \"There's one thing left—we can visit the seer.\"\n\nSamantha lets out a loud laugh. \"Ohh, is that what the creepy tent in the distance is for?\" She gestures toward the large, purple tent standing at the edge of the festival grounds, its fabric rippling slightly in the breeze. The entrance is draped in heavy velvet curtains, a faint glow from inside casting eerie shadows against the fabric. \"What's she gonna do? Tell us we're a Scorpio and that the moons and stars say someone close to us will die?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" you chuckle. You've never really believed in that kind of thing—the supernatural, fortune tellers, all of it. But at this point, you've already paid for the festival, so why not check it out? \"Let's just go. We've got nothing to lose.\"\n\nLuke pockets his phone. \"Yeah, let's do it.\"\n\nThe three of you make your way to the seer's tent, the noise of the festival fading as you approach. Unlike the other attractions, there's no line—no excited chatter, no bustling crowd, just the quiet rustling of the tent's entrance shifting with the wind. It seems that most festival-goers didn't find the idea of a fortune-telling session all that appealing.\n\n\"Alright,\" Samantha says, stopping just outside the entrance. \"Who's going in first?\" She flashes a grin, clearly not expecting anything from this so-called seer.\n\nLuke takes a step back and shakes his head. \"Not me. One of you can go in first and let me know if it's worth it.\"\n\n\"It's not like I want to go first either,\" Samantha complains, crossing her arms stubbornly.\n\nThe two of them turn toward you, eyes expectant.\n\nLooks like it's your decision.\n\n[Choice: Volunteer]\n[Choice: Flip a coin]",

Will you become rich? Will you finally get a girlfriend?\"\n\n \"Or maybe I'll just find out I'm doomed,\" you say dryly.\n\n Luke chuckles and gives you a solid slap on the back. \"Good luck in there man.

He holds it up. \"Alright—heads or tails?\"\n\n \"Heads,\" you state, fully confident.\n\n Luke flicks the coin into the air with his thumb, watching as it spins rapidly before snatching it mid-fall. He slaps it onto the back of hand, then lifts his fingers.\n\n Tails.\n\n \"Good luck, [name],\" Luke grins, clapping you on the shoulder.\n \n\nYou sigh, turning toward the tent, resigned to your fate. Just as you're about to step forward, Samantha suddenly grabs your arm.\n\n\"Hold on a second.\" Samantha points at a wooden sign staked into the ground beside the entrance. The letters, painted in bold black strokes, read:\n\nNO PHOTOS. NO RECORDINGS. RESPECT THE SEER.\n\nSamantha's grin turns downright wicked. \"You know, [name], you could record it,\" she says, holding up her fingers in the shape of a camera and pretending to take a photo. \"Snap! Come on, let's all see your future together.\"\n\nYou blink at her. \"Are you serious? That sign literally says no recording.\"\n\n\"Which is why it's perfect,\" she says, nudging you playfully. \"Think about it—what if this lady actually says something insane? We need proof.\"\n\n\"It would be kinda fun,\" Luke admits, rubbing his chin. \"Maybe we could even upload it.\"\n\nYou hesitate, glancing back at the entrance. The purple fabric of the tent flutters slightly in the breeze as if beckoning you forward. It's probably just some lady in a costume, telling people vague fortunes for fun.\n\n\"...Fine,\" you mutter, pulling out your phone. You open the camera app and press the red button to start recording before tucking the device behind your back. \"Wish me luck.\"\n\n\"Don't die!\" Samantha teases.\n\nLuke chuckles. \"Yeah, man. If she says you're doomed, at least we'll have it on tape.\"\n\nYou roll your eyes, shaking your head as you reach for the tent's entrance.

Candlelight flickers low, gold flames making shadows flicker. The walls of the tent ripple with mystery, every corner whispering secrets you were never meant to hear.\n\nAt the center, she waits.\n\nDraped in violet silk that clings like a lover's touch, the woman reclines beside an open book of strange, swirling script. A sheer veil covers her lips, teasing the imagination, while gold jewelry shimmers along her arms and neck like captured fire. The silk wraps snug around her ample chest, lifting and framing her curves. Her dark hair spills beneath a headpiece, feathers and gems framing her face like a portrait come to life. Every detail about her is deliberate—every line, every movement, every glance.\n\nShe doesn't speak. She doesn't even need to.\n\nThen, suddenly—her eyes snap open.\n\nViolet, piercing irises settle on you with an unwavering gaze, as if she's already seen everything she needs to know.\n\n\"Welcome,\" she says, her voice low and steady, carrying the weight of someone who has spoken many truths before. \"I am Madame Serena, teller of fortunes.\"\n\nYou shift slightly, the hidden weight of your phone pressing against the palm behind your back. Even though you know this is just a festival gimmick, something about her presence makes you sit up a little straighter.\n\n\"Uhh... yeah, hi,\" you say, keeping your tone casual.\n\nShe gestures toward the seat across from her. \"Sit, sit. Fewer seek the guidance of the unseen these days. It seems people no longer wish to know what fate has in store for them.\"\n\nYou nod absently, though you don't exactly share her sentiment. \"Yeah, what a shame,\" you say, more out of politeness than anything else. \"So, what's my fortune? Am I gonna be rich and famous?\"\n\nA flicker of amusement crosses her expression.\n\n\"You seem eager,\" she says. Then, after a brief pause, her gaze sharpens slightly. \"But before we begin... you brought no recording devices inside, did you?\"\n\nYour breath hitches for half a second.\n\nWhy would she ask that?\n\nYou clear your throat and force an awkward laugh. \"Of course not,\" you lie, your fingers subtly adjusting around the phone you're keeping hidden behind your back.\n\nShe watches you for a moment, long enough that you feel the weight of her stare. But then, she simply nods. \"Then let us begin.\"\n\nLifting a deck of tarot cards, she shuffles with practiced ease, the cards slipping smoothly between her fingers. The motion is fluid, effortless, like she's done this a thousand times before. With precision, she lays three cards in front of you, their backs facing upward.\n\n\"The mirror reveals what you hide, what you fear, and what you refuse to see,\" she murmurs.\n\nYou don't know why, but the words send a slight chill down your spine.\n\nMadame Serena turns over the first card.\n\nA man in a jester-like outfit stands at the edge of a cliff, head tilted toward the sky, blissfully unaware of the drop below.\n\nThe Fool.\n\nShe taps a finger toward the card. \"This is you,\" she says. \"You believe yourself in control, yet you walk blindly toward an unseen fate.\"\n\nYou scoff lightly, shifting in your seat. \"I think I'm doing just fine, thanks.\"\n\nBut the words don't settle as easily as you expected. You steal a quick glance at your phone, ensuring it's still recording.\n\nMadame Serena studies you, then moves to the second card. As she flips it over, a pale moon emerges, looming over a dark, rippling landscape.\n\n\"The Moon,\" she says. \"Deception. Illusion. The world you know is not whole.\" Her voice remains steady, but there's something behind her words—something firm, like a truth you haven't realized yet. \"You see yourself as one thing, but that is not the whole of your being.\"\n\nYou feel a strange tightness in your chest.\n\nThis is stupid.\n\nShe's just saying vague, mystical-sounding nonsense, the same way all fortune-tellers do. And yet... something about the way she says it lingers.\n\nYou say nothing as she moves to the final card.\n\nShe flips it over, revealing an illustration of two skeletons leaning into a kiss, their hands intertwined. \n\nThe Lovers.\n\nYour throat goes dry.\n\n\"Two halves,\" Madame Serena says softly. \"Masculine and feminine. You are out of balance.\"\n\nHer violet eyes meet yours, steady and unwavering. \"You mock what you do not understand,\" she says. \"But the mirror will show you the truth you fear. Your reflection is incomplete.\" She tilts her head slightly. \"To see yourself fully, you must first experience the other side of that reflection.\"\n\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\" you spit out, pulse quickening. The words come out sharper than you intend.\n\nMadame Serena doesn't blink. \"Each time you act on what you cannot see, the mirror will shift.\"\n\nBefore you can react, she reaches forward, her fingers snapping around your wrist with startling speed. You jolt, eyes widening as she twists your arm slightly, revealing the phone clutched in your palm.\n\nA sharp pang of fear spikes through your chest.\n\n\"It was a dare!\" you blurt out, your voice a little too high, too rushed. \"I swear, it was just a joke!\"\n\nMadame Serena doesn't look angry or even surprised. If anything... she looks like she expected this.\n\nThen, leaning forward slightly, she speaks.\n\n\"The mirror will reveal your truth, piece by piece, until you learn.\"\n\nA strange, heavy sensation washes over you—something deep, pulling, like invisible hands gripping onto your very core. The edges of your vision blur.\n\nThe last thing you see is Madame Serena's calm, knowing expression.\n\nThen—\n\n E \n v \n e \n r \n y \n t \n h \n i \n n \n g \n \n f \n a \n d \n e \n s \n \n t \n o \n \n b \n l \n a \n c \n k \n . \n\n[Choice: Wake up]",

Your hair, medium-length and tousled from sleep, falls unevenly across your forehead and around your face. It's still recovering from a long night of tossing and turning. You try not to focus on your eyes—the rounder shape you still don't have an explanation for—and instead turn your attention to the mess you call your hair.\n\nGrabbing your sister's brush, you begin to run it through your hair. The bristles glide much more smoothly than your own brush had a few moments prior, pulling tangles free. You continue brushing, watching as your hair gradually shifts with each stroke. It starts to loosen, becoming softer, silkier, and straighter.\n\nYou keep going, lost in the rhythm of the motion. A little more here and a few strokes there.\n\nWhen you finally stop, you nod to yourself. It looks... good. Not just passable or less messy, but actually good. The brush had done a lot more than you expected.\n\nYou reach up and casually tuck a few strands behind your ear, then take a step back to look at yourself in the mirror again.\n\n[Choice: You feel a chill]",

Out of the entire mall?\"\n\nSamantha snorts, throwing a glance at the sign above the doorway like it personally offended her. \"Wow. We could've gone to the arcade, the smoothie place, literally anywhere with flashing lights or food. But no. [name] wanted... books.\"\n\n\"Hey, it's cozy,\" you insist. \"It smells nice and it's quiet.\"\n\nLuke sniffs the air. \"It just smells like paper.\"\n\n\"You mean knowledge,\" you correct, walking inside.\n\nThe scent hits you first—aged pages, faint vanilla, and that comforting musty warmth unique to old shelves. The air is cooler in here and a thick carpet muffles your footsteps. A soft piano instrumental plays overhead, competing only with the occasional hum of someone flipping through a paperback.\n\nSamantha follows with a dramatic sigh, already pulling out her phone like she's shielding herself from the threat of literacy. \"Ten minutes,\" she mutters. \"I'm putting a timer on.\"\n\nLuke stays by the doorway a second longer, peering in like he's afraid the books might leap at him.\n\n\"Come on,\" you nudge him. \"You might find something you like.\"\n\n\"I like pictures,\" he says. \"And explosions. This place is sorely lacking in both.\"\n\nYou roll your eyes. \"Okay, so you've never read a book you enjoyed?\"\n\nLuke squints, thinking real hard. \"I read the Percy Jackson series when I was twelve,\" he finally says. \"Those were pretty cool. The sword fighting, the Greek gods, the crazy superpowers—felt relatable.\"\n\n\"Wow.\" Samantha perks up. \"A whole middle grade series. How brave. What's next? Captain Underpants?\"\n\nLuke frowns. \"Hey, those books had surprisingly deep lore.\"\n\n\"Dude, you are literally proving my point.\"\n\nYou wander back toward the Young Adult section, where a display of newly-arrived paperbacks catches your eye. Most of them are the usual—fantasy sagas and angsty romance—but two books stand out from the rest, neatly propped up be side each other like they're daring you to choose.\n\nThe first one has a clean, minimalistic cover—white background, sharp serif title, and a stack of old books overlaid with a diagram of a double helix. It looks like the kind of book that would teach you something.\n\nThe second one is the opposite: bold colors, a stylized silhouette mid-jump, muscles outline in dramatic motion. It's about someone chasing glory—training, improving, striving. You're not even sure if it's fiction or a memoir, but its energy is magnetic.\n\nLuke peers over your shoulder. \"Ooh, are you gonna get the sciencey one? Or the one with the guy doing backflips?\"\n\n\"Don't let Luke peer pressure you into getting the one with abs on the cover,\" Samantha says from across the aisle.\n\nLuke raises his hands. \"Hey, I'm just saying it looks cool. Like, I'd read that one.\"\n\n\"You haven't finished a book since seventh grade,\" Samantha fires back.\n\nYou roll your eyes with a laugh and glance down at the two books again, feeling a flicker of curiosity.\n\nOr... maybe you'll pass for now. It is ten dollars after all.\n\n[Choice: Buy the book with the academic cover]\n[Choice: Buy the book with the athletic cover]\n[Choice: Skip buying a book for today]",

      "text": "You turn the academic book over in your hands, thumbing along the clean spine. Something about it keeps pulling you in. The back cover synopsis promises a deep dive into perception, cognition, and the way identity can shift depend on how we're seen—or not seen—by others. It sounds intense, maybe even a little above your level, but you've been craving something like this lately. Something that might help you make sense of the weird blur your life's become.\n\n \"This one,\" you say, lifting the book up. \"It feels like something I should try reading.\"\n\n Luke peers over your shoulder and squints at the back cover. \"Let me see. 'And exploration of the liminal self in transitional adolescent through the lens of postmodern psycholinguistics...'\" He trails off, his eyebrows slowly knitting together. \"Okay, no offense, but what the hell does any of that mean?\"\n\n You suppress a laugh. \"It means it's not for you.\"\n\n Luke tilts his head, eyes still locked on the tiny print. \"Dude, my brain just gave up. Like, I felt it. It waved the white flag.\"\n\n \"Poor baby,\" Samantha says dryly. \"Did the mean book use too many syllables?\"\n\n Luke holds up a finger in protest. \"I read all of Percy Jackson twice, thank you.\"\n\n \"Didn't you read the graphic novel version?\" Samantha snarks.\n\n He doesn't deny it.\n\n You shake your head, still grinning, and head toward the register. The cashier barely glances up as you place the book down, and you're already tapping your phone to the reader. A soft beep, a digital receipt, and the book is yours.\n\n You tuck it under your arm as you turn back to your friend. Luke is still rubbing his temples like he's just walked out of a midterm.\n\n \"That book gave me psychic damage,\" he mutters.\n\n \"You didn't even read it,\" you point out.\n\n \"I tried,\" he says, solemnly. \"And it tried back.\"\n\n Samantha finally joins you both, arms folded and eyebrow arched. \"So, what's the plan? Gonna read it over coffee while wearing a turtleneck and silently judging the rest of us?\"\n\n \"I don't own a turtleneck,\" you say, stepping out of the store. \"But now I kind of want one.\"\n\n Luke makes a thoughtful noise. \"I think you'd look smart in a turtleneck.\"\n\n You don't answer. You're too busy flipping through the first few pages as you walk, already getting pulled in by the dense text and quiet promise of meaning just under the surface.\n\n You're not sure if you'll understand all of it. But for some reason, it feels like the right kind of challenge.\n\n \n \n \n You pick up the athletic book, the one with the bold cover. The back cover mentions themes like perseverance, team drama, self-discovery, and finding confidence through movement. You're not sure why it grabs you the way it does... but it does.\n\n \"This one,\" you say, holding it up.\n\n Luke leans over your shoulder, eyes brightening immediately. \"Ooh, that looks fun! You gotta lend it to me after you're done.\"\n \n You glance sideways at him, one eyebrow slowly lifting. \"You mean like last time?\"\n\n \"What last time?\" Luke asks, tilting his head.\n\n \"The last time I lent you a book, your dog ate it.\"\n\n \"Oh that last time,\" Luke says, sheepish but grinning. \"Come on, that was months ago! He thought it was a chew toy. He has better taste now. In like... both snacks and literature.\"\n\n \"Didn't he also chew up your controller last week?\" you point out.\n\n Luke opens his mouth, pauses, then shrugs. \"That was a different controller. And he was going through stuff.\"\n\n Samantha, still scrolling on her phone like she's far too cool to be involved in the conversation, snorts without looking up. \"What could your dog possibly be going through, Luke? Did he get dumped by his girlfriend? Is he behind on his taxes? Is Need of Arms: Bark Ops too emotionally intense now?\"\n\n \"Hey, you don't know his life,\" Luke huffs.\n\n You shake your head, laughing under your breath, and walk over to the register. You tap your phone against the reader, the soft ding confirming the purchase. You get a digital receipt and the book is yours.\n\n You hold it for a moment before tucking it under your arm. As you step out of the store, Luke jogs to catch up beside you, eyes on the book. \"So... after you're done, right? Like two weeks? One?\"\n\n \"We'll see,\" you say. \"You might have to earn my trust back.\"\n\n \"I'll prove I'm worthy,\" he says, clasping his hands together like he's pledging a solemn vow. \"My dog will not get within ten feet of this book. I will set up barriers.\"\n\n \"Can one of those barriers be common sense?\" Samantha quips, walking ahead with a sigh.\n\n You trail behind them, book in hand and grin on your face, wondering what story you've just stepped into.\n\n \n \"Hmm, maybe later,\" you say, placing the books you just picked up back on the shelf.\n \n \"Are you not going to buy it, [name]?\" Samantha asks, leaning over.\n \n \"Yeah, I'm too broke,\" you say, a chuckle escaping your lips. You check your digital wallet to see that you have [money] dollars for the rest of your shopping trip.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

This is what I'm talking about.\"\n\nThe store is brightly lit, clean displays and colorful posters lining the walls. Consoles hum quietly beneath glass cases, and a rotating display in the center flickers with trailers for upcoming releases. Techno music pulses from overhead speakers, fast and loud, while a few kids cluster around demo kiosks, arguing over a racing game.\n\nLuke walks ahead without waiting, making a beeline for a pair of oversized beanbags near the demo station. \"They've got the new shooter and the co-op puzzle one,\" he calls over his shoulder. \"Solid picks.\"\n\nYou follow him and drop into the purple beanbag next to him as he settles into the green one, controller already in hand.\n\n\"I could live here,\" he says. You can't tell if he's joking or not. \"Like, just give me a mini fridge and a blanket. Done deal.\"\n\nSamantha strolls up behind you, arms crossed. \"You'd forget to eat, sleep, and answer texts.\"\n\n\"Not true,\" Luke says, smirking. \"You see, I'd text back between matches. Very responsible.\"\n\nShe rolls her eyes. \"No offense, but I'm putting my money on [name].\"\n\n\"Offense taken,\" Luke replies, wounded. \"But also fair.\"\n\nHe nudges you with his elbow, nodding toward the screen. \"Alright, your pick. We've got the shooter if you want to go head-to-head, or the puzzle game if you're feeling cooperative. Fair warning, I'm better at reflexes than logic. But I can give it a shot.\"\n\nYou scroll through the options, glancing at the covers on the wall and the kids still fighting over the leaderboard near the corner. Luke stretches out beside you, casual but clearly excited.\n\n\"Honestly, either's good,\" he adds. \"If we do the shooter, prepare to lose. If we do puzzles, I'll pretend I know what I'm doing.\"\n\n\"Pretend harder,\" Samantha says under her breath.\n\n\"You have no faith in me, Samantha,\" Luke says, shaking his head. \"None at all.\"\n\nYou shake your head, deciding on a game as the controller clicks under your thumb.

The background music is all war drums and electric guitar. Gritty. Dramatic. Over-the-top.\n\n You smirk. \"This look familiar?\"\n\n Luke lights up like a Christmas tree. \"No freaking way—they have CosmoClash here? Dude, I used to live on this game.\"\n\n Used to. You're pretty sure \"used to\" means \"played six hours last night.\" He's already reaching for the controller like a man reunited with his long-lost lover.\n\n Samantha rolls her eyes behind you both. \"Yay. Digital violence and male bonding. I'll be over here pretending I'm not being third-wheeled by two human Doritos.\"\n\n Luke immediately selects his favorite loadout—plasma carbine, jetpack, and reflective armor. You take your pick, less familiar but not totally new either.\n\n \"Ready to get smoked?\" you ask, giving him a side glance.\n\n \"Not a chance,\" he says, cracking his knuckles like this is a tournament match.\n\n The game drops you both into a mirrored arena—a floating asteroid base with gleaming blue lights and lots of verticality. The timer starts. Five minutes. First to fifteen kills.\n\n You barely get your bearings before Luke is on you like a heat-seeking missile. He zip-jets above you, rains down a flurry of laser bolts, then lands with a melee to your helmet. Game announcer: \"First Blood.\"\n\n You respawn and get a few good hits in the next round, even managing to corner him in a corridor. But he drives backward off a ledge, sticks the wall, and swings around the corner with his secondary. Your screen goes red again.\n\n \"Two to zero,\" he mutters, laser-focused.\n\n \"Okay, chill,\" you say, gripping your controller tighter.\n\n It doesn't help. Every time you think you have a plan, Luke's already three steps ahead—jetting across rooftops, tossing plasma grenades with casual precision, or sniping you mid-sprint.\n\n Samantha peeks over the edge of the demo screen. \"Is [name] okay? Should I call for an ambulance?\"\n\n You grit your teeth. \"It's fine. I've got this.\"\n\n You do not got this.\n\n The score climbs: 8-2, 11-3, 13-4...\n\n At one point, Luke jumps from a launchpad, sticks you with a grenade midair, lands behind a crate, and types \"lol\" into the chat.\n\n \"Oh my God, you teabagged me,\" you groan, horrified.\n\n \"That wasn't a teabag,\" he says with a smirk. \"That was... aggressive crouching.\"\n\n \"Semantics,\" Samantha snorts.\n\n Finally, match point. You bunker behind a shield barrier, determined not go down quietly.\n\n \"Alright,\" you mutter. \"Come at me.\"\n\n Luke does. He jetpacks through your shield like it's made of paper, double-pumps a plasma blast to your chest, and finishes with a melee that knocks your avatar across the screen in slow motion.\n\n \"Victory.\"\n\n The announcer says it like it's holy.\n\n Luke drops his controller and lets out a satisfied sigh, stretching like he just finished a long day of work. \"God, I love this game.\"\n\n You slump back into your beanbag, blinking at the screen. \"Dude. Do you even sleep?\"\n\n \"Sleep is for people who lose,\" he says with a wide grin.\n\n Samantha claps once. \"Well. That was a murder. I haven't seen someone get wrecked that hard since Jessica told off that guy who called her 'mid.'\"\n\n You can't help but to laugh. \"Alright. You win. You're cracked.\"\n\n Luke leans over and fist-bumps you. \"We should duo next time. I swear I can carry.\"\n\n You roll your eyes. \"Sure. Just don't teabag our teammates.\"\n\n \"No promises.\"\n\n \n \n \n You scroll past the flashy shooter option and land on something that looks a little... slower-paced. The title flashes on the screen in neon blue letters: PortHole: Double Trouble. A sleek co-op puzzle game.\n\n \"Let's try this one,\" you say, clicking confirm.\n\n Luke leans over to read the game description. \"Two-player brain bender... test chambers... logic puzzles... okay, sure. How hard can it be?\"\n\n Samantha snorts behind you. \"Famous last words.\"\n\n The screen fades in, showing too robot avatars—one tall and skinny, the other short and round—being dropped into a shiny test chamber by a snarky AI named Orbyx. She has a voice like she's permanently bored with your existence.\n\n \"Welcome, meatless disappointments. Please attempt to collaborate. For science.\"\n\n \"Alright,\" Luke says, blinking. \"Rude.\"\n\n The first test is simple enough—just a pair of buttons that need to be pressed at the same time to open a door. You both run to your respective switches, count down from three, and step on them.\n\n \"See?\" Luke exclaims, looking pleased. \"Easy. We're basically geniuses.\"\n\n The next room involves portals.\n\n Very quickly, it becomes clear that Luke has no idea how to use his portal gun.\n\n You try to calmly explain the mechanics—how the blue portal connects to the orange one, and how momentum carries through them—but Luke somehow manages to place his two portals in the same wall and then run in a circle for a full thirty seconds.\n\n \"Why does mine keep facing the wrong way?\" he says, spinning in place and firing portals at his own feet.\n\n \"Because you keep jumping while shooting,\" you point out, trying not to laugh. \"Just aim. And stop trying to trickshot like this is Need of Arms.\"\n\n \"I'm not trickshotting,\" Luke says defensively. \"I'm... innovating.\"\n\n \"Yeah, you innovated a way to trap yourself in a corner,\" Samantha deadpans from behind you.\n\n In the next test chamber, you're supposed to use momentum to fling yourself across a gap using angled platforms and portals. You do your part flawlessly, landing neatly on the other side and waiting for Luke to follow.\n\n Instead, Luke fires a portal directly beneath himself... and then forgets to place the second one on the platform.\n\n He drops like a rock.\n\n The next ten minutes are a chaotic blur of poorly timed launches, mistimed switches, and one unforgettable moment where Luke accidentally locks you in a laser trap and doesn't notice for a full minute.\n \n \"Why is your screen all red?\" he asks as your character frantically bangs on the glass.\n\n \"Because I'm on fire, Luke!\"\n\n \"Wait, really? Oh, that's... wow. My bad.\"\n\n Samantha is doubled over by this point, watching from behind with a hand over her mouth. \"This is the best entertainment I've had all week.\"\n\n Eventually, after far too many deaths and sarcastic comments from Orbyx—\"If I had hands, I would be facepalming\"—you both manage to limp your way through the final chamber.\n\n You're not sure whether to feel proud or just relieved.\n\n Luke drops the controller onto his lap and leans back with a satisfied sigh. \"That was awesome.\"\n\n \"Dude, you almost killed me eight times,\" you say, rubbing your temples.\n\n \"Yeah, but we made it, didn't we?\" He grins, wide and proud.\n\n You glance at the screen where your robot characters give each other an awkward high five.\n\n \"Barely,\" you mutter.\n\n Samantha just shakes her head, clearly amused. \"Well. I know who not to call if I ever get trapped in a science lab.\"\n\n \"I'd rescue you,\" Luke says cheerfully. \"But I'd probably trip over a button and launch you into space.\"\n\n \"How touching,\" she replies.\n\n Still, despite the chaos, there's a smile on your face as you hand the controller back to the counter. Luke might not be puzzle-inclined, but hanging out with him like this? Kind of worth it.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

That's a steal. You should totally get it.\"\n\nSamantha stares at him. \"Luke, you'd buy a jar of air for fifty bucks if it was 'enchanted.'\"\n\nIsolde beams, already turning back to you. \"So, young seeker.

It's obviously a scam. But then again...\n\n \"Why the hell not,\" you mutter, more to yourself than anyone else, and pull out your phone.\n\n Isolde lights up like you just announced she'd won the lottery. \"An excellent choice!\" she croons, sweeping the crystal off the counter and cradling it in both hands. \"This stone will attune your aura to the pathways of the mystic arts.\"\n\n \"It's a rock,\" Samantha deadpans. \"A rock that probably came from the clearance bin at a craft store.\"\n\n Isolde ignores her completely, already pulling out a suspiciously advanced payment setup. \"We take cash, debit, credit, e-transfer, Speedmo, PayBuddy, StashApp, Fruit Pay, Giggle Pay, Zippy...\" she says, rattling off options like she's a bank. \"Oh, and if you sign up for my loyalty program, your next aura-cleansing session will be half off.\"\n\n Luke's eyes go wide. \"Dude. That's customer service. She takes everything.\"\n\n \"Yeah, because she's a con artist,\" Samantha mutters.\n\n But you've already tapped your phone against the reader with a resigned sigh. The device beeps cheerily, and Isolde claps her hands like a proud mother watching her child graduate. \"The universe thanks you,\" she says, placing the crystal into a velvet pouch that looks like it costs five cents. \"Carry it close to your heart, and it will guide you.\"\n\n Samantha folds her arms and gives you a dangerous look. \"You are so dumb. I hope you enjoy your ten-dollar gravel.\"\n\n Luke, on the other hand, is elated. \"Brooo, you're gonna be so magical,\" he says, clapping you on the shoulder. \"Like, I bet that thing glows under a full moon or shoots lasers or something.\"\n\n As you walk out, Samantha shakes her head like she can't believe she's friends with you. Luke, meanwhile, is already brainstorming names for your \"new magic powers.\"\n\n \"Lightning [name],\" he says thoughtfully. \"No, wait—[name] the Enchanted.\"\n\n \"[name] the Idiot,\" Samantha cuts in.\n\n You sigh, wondering which one of them is actually right.\n\n \n You stare at the crystal for a moment longer before setting it back on the counter.\n\n \"Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass,\" you say, trying to sound polite.\n\n Isolde blinks once, then lets out a long sigh. \"Very well,\" she says. \"But know that opportunities like this rarely come twice. The universe does not beg.\"\n\n \"Man, why'd you do that?\" Luke asks. \"You could've been magic, [name]. Like, who knows? That crystal could've given you, like, fire powers or something.\"\n\n Samantha rolls her eyes so hard you're surprised they don't get stuck. \"Yeah, or it could've given him a ten-dollar hole in his wallet. I'm actually relieved. Congrats, [name], you're not completely stupid.\"\n\n \"Thanks, I think?\" you reply, still a little unsure whether that was a compliment or not.\n\n Isolde leans over the counter as if she's trying to reel you back in. \"When your path grows dark, you'll wish you hadn't walked away from this choice,\" she says ominously.\n\n Samantha doesn't even wait for her to finish. \"When my path grows dark, I'll buy a flashlight,\" she mutters, already heading toward the door.\n\n You follow Samantha out, with Luke trailing behind. He's still lamenting your \"missed opportunity.\" \"Seriously, you could've been, like, the chosen one or something,\" he says, shaking his head.\n\n \"Or I could've been out ten bucks,\" you reply, pushing open the door and letting the heavy incense fog stay behind where it belongs.\n\n \"Lame,\" Luke says, but he's grinning anyway.\n\n Samantha claps you on the back. \"Welcome back to reality, champ.\"\n\n You inhale as the fresh mall air hits you. Whatever that was, at least you got out without being the proud owner of a supposedly \"blessed\" rock.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "As soon as you step through the sliding glass doors, you're hit with a wave of warmth and soft, ambient music—background noise barely audible beneath the faint sounds of barking, the occasional meow, and the hum of filters in fish tanks. The air smells like sawdust, kibble, and something faintly sweet.\n\nSamantha immediately gasps like she's seen a celebrity. \"Oh my God!\" she blurts, and practically skips ahead, darting past displays of chew toys and scratching posts to press her hands against the window of one of the glass kennels. \"Look at that one. Look at that one. Holy shit, he has eyebrows. Thank you, [name]. I didn't know we needed this, but we did. You're a genius.\"\n\nLuke strolls in after her, hands in his pockets, his eyes sweeping over the store in quiet fascination. \"This place is pretty big,\" he says, pausing by a stack of aquariums. A school of neon tetras flicker under the glow of a soft blue light. \"I didn't know people kept fish this tiny. This one's the size of a fingernail.\"\n\n\"Pretty sure some of these tanks are illegal,\" you murmur, watching a single goldfish loop lazy circles in a glass bowl that looks better suited for a scented candle. You remember reading somewhere that goldfish need much more space than people think—actual tanks, not glorified jars. You file that thought away with a frown.\n\nTo your left, guinea pigs scurry through plastic tunnels while a sleepy hamster half-buries itself in wood shavings. There's even a small reptile section in the back with a turtle staring dramatically into space, like it's contemplating the meaning of life.\n\nA young woman in a store apron notices your group and heads over with a bright, practiced smile. She adjusts her nametag—Morgan, it says—and tucks a piece of hair behind her ear.\n\n\"Hi there! Just browsing, or are you hoping to make a furry friend today?\" she asks, addressing all three of you. \"We actually have a couple of social pets who love meeting visitors, if you'd like to spend a little time with one.\"\n\n\"Wait, seriously?\" Luke asks, perking up. \"We can just hang out with them?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" Morgan beams. \"We find it helps them socialize, and it's a nice break for them too. We have two you can meet today—one's this sweet labrador puppy, super energetic, total goofball. And the other is a tabby cat who's been unusually affectionate lately.\"\n\nShe gestures first toward a small black lab who's panting so hard his whole body is wiggling. His tongue flops out the side of his mouth like he has absolutely no idea how to manage it. \"That's Bolt,\" she says. \"He'll play with you until your arms fall off.\"\n\nThen she turns slightly and points to a smaller enclosure near the front of the store. A soft gray tabby is perched inside on a carpeted ledge, daintily licking her paw with the kind of calm detachment that makes her look far too elegant for this chaotic world. \"And that's Misty. She's been watching you all since you walked in.\"\n\nSamantha's face lights up. \"Dude, I love her. I am spiritually connected to this cat. She has a judgmental aura and perfect eyeliner.\"\n\n\"I want to meet the dog,\" Luke says at the same time, crouching down in front of Bolt's enclosure with a slow, curious grin. \"He looks like a dork. I love it.\"\n\n\"Alright then, [name],\" Samantha says, nudging your arm. \"It's up to you to break the tie. Do we hang out with the adorable mess of a dog, or the mysterious and beautiful feline who almost certainly runs this place from behind the scenes?\"\n\nLuke looks up from where Bolt is now trying to lick the glass like it wronged him personally. \"No pressure, but he's already imagining us playing fetch in a field of dreams.\"\n\nYou glance between the two animals—Bolt wagging like his life depends on it, and Misty, who now has one paw elegantly draped over the other, staring at you like she's judging your soul.\n\nEither way, it's a choice between chaos and grace.\n\nYou take a deep breath and decide.\n\n[Choice: Choose the dog]\n[Choice: Choose the cat]",

      "text": "The moment you say \"Let's meet Bolt,\" it's like you flipped a switch in Luke.\n\n \"YES!\" he practically shouts, punching the air like you just scored the winning point in overtime. \"Knew you'd pick the right one, dude. Good instincts.\"\n\n Even Bolt seems to know something exciting just happened. The dog's tail goes into overdrive, thudding against the side of the enclosure like a percussion instrument, tongue lolling, eyes gleaming with uncontainable joy. He's already pawing at the glass by the time the shop assistant comes over with a leash and a soft smile.\n\n \"Alright,\" Morgan laughs, unlocking the enclosure. \"Just be warned—he will jump on you. He doesn't mean to, he's just... very enthusiastic.\"\n\n The second the latch clicks open, Bolt bursts out like a bottle rocket of pure, unfiltered chaos. He almost skids on the polished floor, but recovers. He barrels toward Luke first, and to your surprise, Luke doesn't flinch. He just braces for it like a wide receiver catching a particularly slobbery touchdown.\n\n Bolt rears up and plants two paws right on Luke's chest, tail wagging so hard it could probably generate electricity. Luke laughs loudly and ruffles the dog's floppy ears with both hands.\n\n \"Bro,\" he says, looking absolutely thrilled, \"we're communicating on a primal level right now.\"\n\n Samantha, standing off to the side with arms crossed, watches the chaos unfold with one raised brow. \"Yeah, I can see it. Dog meets dog.\"\n\n She steps back just in time to avoid getting a faceful of dog tongue, giving Bolt a wary look. \"You guys have fun rolling in dirt together. I'll be over here preserving my dignity.\"\n\n You crouch down as Bolt turns toward you, still buzzing with energy. He doesn't leap this time, but he does nudge your hand with his wet nose, then immediately presses his head into your palm like you've always been friends.\n\n \"Hey, buddy,\" you say, scratching behind his ears. His fur is sleek and warm, and the way his tail starts wagging twice as quickly lets you know you've hit the sweet spot.\n\n Luke sits cross-legged on the floor now, completely immersed, holding one of the rope toys the store provided. \"You see, Bolt's not just smart,\" he says, throwing the rope a few feet and watching Bolt zoom after it with joyful abandon. \"He's got... like a soul. You can feel it.\"\n\n \"No shit, Sherlock,\" Samantha snorts. \"Of course he has a soul. So do cockroaches. It doesn't mean I want them licking my face.\"\n\n Bolt trots back and drops the toy neatly in Luke's lap. Then he turns to Samantha with a big grin, tongue hanging sideways.\n\n \"Oh no,\" she says, backing up. \"Don't you dare—\"\n\n Bolt bounds toward her like she's his new best friend, but Samantha sidesteps. \"Look, Bolt. I see you. I respect you. I just... don't want your spit on my jeans, okay.\"\n\n Despite her protests, there's a faint smile on her lips as she watches Luke and Bolt continue their game. For a moment, the three of you settle into a rhythm—Luke tossing the rope, Bolt retrieving it with boundless energy, and you alternating between petting and laughing at the ridiculous expressions he makes.\n\n Samantha eventually crouches down a safe distance away and holds out her hand. \"Okay, fine. I'll pet him once. One polite head pat.\"\n\n Bolt tilts his head, reads her energy, and to everyone's surprise, calmly walks over and lowers his head into her palm.\n\n \"Okay, that was... weirdly respectful,\" Samantha admits, stroking his head once, then twice. \"Maybe you're not as drool-powered as I thought.\"\n\n Bolt immediately sneezes on her shoes.\n\n She glares. \"I take it back.\"\n\n Luke bursts out laughing again, cheeks flushed with joy. \"Best. Store. Ever.\"\n\n You watch the scene unfold—Luke glowing like he's in love, Samantha pretending to be annoyed but not actually pulling away, and Bolt panting in the middle of it all, happy just to be part of your little world.\n\n You didn't come here expecting much. Maybe a moment of fun, something to pass the time. But as Bolt flops on the floor and rolls over for a belly rub, you find yourself wondering what it would be like to have a creature like this in your life. Loyal. Open. Joyful in the most uncomplicated way.\n\n Maybe that's what Luke sees in him. Maybe that's what you're starting to see too.\n\n \n The moment you glance toward the tabby perched with regal indifference behind the glass, you feel Samantha's eyes flick to yours in anticipation.\n\n \"Oho,\" she says, watching your gaze settle. \"Going feline, huh?\"\n\n You nod slowly, already caught by the way the cat's tail flicks with precise rhythm.\n\n \"I want to meet Misty,\" you say, reading the little placard beside the enclosure. \"She seems... cool.\"\n\n \"Excellent choice,\" Samantha replies, smugly satisfied. \"I knew you had taste.\"\n\n Luke looks betrayed. \"But the dog, Bolt, he was so soft.\"\n\n \"You can go pet your dog doppelgänger later,\" Samantha says, waving him off. \"Right now we're spending time with the superior pet.\"\n\n Morgan sees you gesturing toward Misty's enclosure. \"Ah, Misty,\" she says with a warm smile. \"You've got good instincts. She's picky about people, but when she likes someone, she really likes them.\"\n\n As she gently opens the enclosure, Misty stretches like she's been preparing for this exact moment all day—her back arches high, paws extending. Then, in a single bound, she lands gracefully on the padded floor of the small pet interaction area.\n\n \"She's free to roam around a bit,\" Morgan says. \"Feel free to sit, let her come to you.\"\n\n \"Well, well,\" Samantha murmurs, scratching lightly behind Misty's ear. \"A creature after my own heart.\"\n\n Luke kneels down on the floor, holding out a hand toward the tabby with a hopeful smile. \"Hi, Misty. I come in peace.\"\n\n Misty slowly turns her head toward him and stares.\n\n Then, with deliberate grace, she lifts her paw and bats him squarely on the nose—claws retracted, but firm enough to send a message.\n\n Samantha bursts into laughter, clutching Misty slightly closer. \"Oh my God, she just smacked you like you were a bug.\"\n\n Luke sits back, hands raised in surrender. \"Dude, I didn't even do anything! That was unprovoked violence!\"\n\n \"Well, Misty here is asserting dominance,\" Samantha says, clearly delighted. \"You're in her domain now. Respect the queen.\"\n\n You bite your lip to hold back a grin as Misty, now entirely content, nestles into Samantha's lap and closes her eyes. Her purring begins, low and steady, vibrating through the denim of Samantha's jeans.\n\n \"She really likes you,\" you say.\n\n \"Of course she does,\" Samantha replies, smug as ever. \"She sees a fellow woman of taste.\"\n\n Luke tries once more, slowly scooting closer on his knees like a man pleading for forgiveness. \"Okay, truce. I'll even give you some of my Skittles. Just... give me a chance.\"\n\n Misty lifts her head just slightly. Her ears flick. Then she lays back down and turns her entire body so her back is to Luke.\n\n \"Oof,\" you wince.\n\n \"She's literally ghosting you in real time,\" Samantha says, nearly wheezing from laughter.\n\n Luke slumps back against the wall, arms crossed and sulking. \"All I'm saying is that dogs never treat me like this.\"\n\n \"Yeah, and dogs also lick their own butts,\" Samantha replies. \"Maybe that's why you get along.\"\n\n You can't help but laugh as Misty lets out a long, pleased sigh and burrows a little deeper into Samantha's lap, like she's settling in for the long haul.\n\n And honestly? You're kind of impressed. Not many beings can keep up with Samantha, let alone match her energy and attitude. But this cat? Misty might actually be her perfect counterpart.\n\n And judging by the smug look on Samantha's face, she's thinking the exact same thing.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "After what feels like both a minute and a lifetime, Bolt flops onto his side with a huff, tongue lolling out the side of his mouth, chest rising and falling like he's just finished a tough workout. His tail still thumps lightly against the floor, even as he rests. It's like he can't help but keep wagging for you.\n\n Luke, cross-legged beside him, is also breathless. His hair's sticking to his forehead from all the play, and there's a faint red mark on his arm from where Bolt excitedly pawed him a little too hard.\n\n \"I think I'm in love,\" Luke says, not even joking.\n\n Samantha wipes her hands off on a tissue she pulled from her pocket. \"With a dog.\"\n\n Luke nods. \"Yeah. Duh.\"\n\n You smile, crouching down to give Bolt one last head rub. \"You've got good taste. He's kind of a perfect little guy.\"\n\n \"Dude, he is not little,\" Samantha says, squinting at the lab sprawled out on the floor like a rug. \"He's a menace with paws. That dog could take on a linebacker.\"\n\n \"I like him,\" Luke says again, a little quieter this time.\n\n Morgan, the pet store employee, walks back over. She's holding a clipboard and smiling at the three of you like she's seen this play out before—teenagers, puppy love, and a very expensive price tag.\n\n \"Looks like someone made a new best friend,\" she says warmly, crouching beside Bolt and giving his side a fond pat. He gives her a lazy lick in return.\n\n Luke sits up a little straighter. \"Hey, uh—what would it take to, you know, actually take him home.\"\n\n Morgan glances at the clipboard, then looks back up. \"Well, Bolt's still pretty young, so he's not too expensive compared to some of the purebred pups... but with his vaccinations, chips, and starter supplies, he'd come out to about [850].\"\n\n There's a pause.\n\n Luke freezes, mid-smile. \"Eight... hundred?\"\n\n \"Fifty,\" Morgan confirms.\n\n He looks down at Bolt. Then back up. Then at his wallet, which, if you remember right, currently contains a crumpled ten-dollar bill and a packet of unopened Skittles.\n\n \"I have... candy,\" Luke says, mostly to himself.\n\n Bolt gives a soft whine, pawing at Luke's knee like he knows.\n\n Luke laughs, but it cracks halfway through. He runs a hand through his hair and lets out a quiet breath. \"Sorry, bud. I guess it's not in the cards today.\"\n\n Bolt leans against him one more time, head nuzzled into his side, and Luke wraps an arm around him like it's the only thing holding him together.\n\n Samantha watches the whole thing without a joke this time, arms crossed but face soft.\n\n You clear your throat, suddenly self-conscious. \"Um, Morgan? Just so you know, we weren't, like, planning on buying anything today. We kind of just came in to look. I hope that's okay.\"\n\n \"That's totally fine,\" Morgan says, waving you off. \"It happens more than you think. Honestly, Bolt probably appreciated the playtime anyway. He gets a little restless during slow hours.\"\n\n Luke sniffs once, wiping at his nose. \"Can I—\" His voice wobbles. He swallows. \"Can I come back to visit him sometimes? If he's still here.\"\n\n Morgan nods with a smile. \"Of course. And if you ever want to fill out an interest form, I'll keep your name on it in case anything changes.\"\n\n Luke doesn't answer right away. He just leans down and presses his forehead to Bolt's, closing his eyes. \"Bye for now, okay?\" he murmurs.\n\n Bolt licks his chin.\n\n You all watch in silence as Morgan leads Bolt gently back to his enclosure. His tail wags the whole time.\n\n None of you speak for a few seconds, leaving a moment of silence in Bolt's honor.\n\n Then Samantha glances at Luke and breaks it.\n\n \"You gonna be okay, golden boy?\" she asks, gently teasing but not mocking.\n\n Luke sighs dramatically, clasping a hand to his heart. \"Once I get home, I'll tell my dog about the one that got away.\"\n\n You shake your head, laughing under your breath. Samantha rolls her eyes but is smiling, and even Luke—dramatic farewell and all—starts grinning again.\n\n Still, as the door closes behind you, you can't help but to glance back at the glass just once. Bolt's already lying down again, chewing on a toy. But for a moment, you swear he lifts his head and looks back. Just for a second. Just to say goodbye.\n\n \n Eventually, Misty stretches out one last time—delicately and lazily, as if to remind everyone that she decides when things are over. Then she hops off Samantha's lap in a single fluid motion, tail flicking with a grace that only a cat who knows her worth can manage.\n\n Samantha brushes a bit of silver fur off her jeans, still wearing a faint, dreamy smirk. \"If I were a cat, I'd be Misty,\" she says.\n\n Luke, still seated on the floor like a rejected suitor, gives her a flat look. \"Cold and judgmental?\"\n\n Samantha tilts her head, pretending to think it over. \"Beautiful, independent, and doesn't take shit from boys.\"\n\n \"Same thing,\" Luke mutters under his breath, sounding mildly defeated.\n\n You give Misty one last look as she circles the room with a sense of purpose, then pad over to the door to the enclosure area as Morgan returns.\n\n \"Well,\" Samantha says, giving Misty a final scratch behind the ears, \"thanks for choosing me over the boys. You've got good taste.\"\n\n Misty responds by casually licking her paw and ignoring everyone.\n\n Luke leans forward one last time, hands clasped like he's about to plead in prayer. \"Bye, Misty. I hope you live a long, happy life.\"\n\n Misty doesn't so much as glance at him. She simply saunters back toward her enclosure and hops up onto her perch, her back to all of you.\n\n \"Ouch,\" Luke winces. \"It's like she knows.\"\n\n \"She does,\" Samantha says immediately, already heading for the store exit. \"Cats always know.\"\n\n Morgan steps in to guide Misty gently back into her space. \"She seemed to like you all—well, most of you,\" she adds with a knowing smile toward Luke, who dramatically clutches his chest.\n\n You glance at Morgan, rubbing the back of your neck a little. \"Hey, um... just so you know, we were just browsing. We're not actually planning on buying anything today.\"\n\n \"That's completely fine,\" Morgan says, waving it off before you can finish. \"Honestly, the animals like the company. Especially Misty—she's picky, so it's nice when she finds someone she clicks with.\"\n\n \"She clicked with me,\" Samantha brags.\n\n Morgan chuckles. \"She did. You have the same energy.\"\n\n Samantha looks far too pleased by that.\n\n \"Anyway, feel free to come by any time,\" Morgan continues, \"Whether you're buying or just visiting, they're always happy for the attention.\"\n\n You nod gratefully. \"Thanks.\"\n\n Luke sighs, trailing after you and Samantha toward the exit. \"I still can't believe she hated me. I have a dog! He loves me. I'm good with animals.\"\n\n \"She sensed weakness in you,\" Samantha says breezily, pushing open the glass door. \"That, or she didn't like the Skittles in your pocket.\"\n\n Luke stops short. \"You think she could smell them?\"\n\n \"Wouldn't you be mad if someone brought candy to your house and didn't share?\" she says without missing a beat.\n\n You stifle a laugh as the three of you step back into the mall's bright, polished corridor. You didn't leave with a pet, but something about the experience sticks with you. Something about the way Samantha smiles when Misty sat with her.\n\n It was small, but it means something.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "The cool blast of air conditioning hits you as the three of you step into the sleek, ultra-modern tech store. Everything inside gleams like it's been polished five minutes ago. It's quiet in that kind of way only expensive places are, like even the air knows it costs too much to breathe here.\n\nYour eyes drift across a lineup of high-end tablets sitting on a curved display table. A robotic voice murmurs a promotional message: \"Experience the future at your fingertips.\"\n\nSamantha makes a beeline for the smartphone section, arms crossed like she's judging the merchandise. \"Oh my God,\" she mutters. \"They've got the new eyeFone. The one with the ridiculous name and the camera bump that looks like it wants to fight you.\"\n\nShe leans in closer, squinting at the price tag. \"I want it.\"\n\nLuke trails after her, lifting an eyebrow. \"Do you have a thousand dollars?\"\n\nSamantha glances at him sideways. \"Yeah, right next to my private jet, supermodel wife, and beachfront estate.\"\n\nLuke snorts, then turns to you. \"Seriously though, why'd you bring us in here? We're broke.\"\n\n\"I dunno,\" you shrug. \"It's fun to look. Maybe we'll find something on sale, like a ten-dollar screen wipe or a charger that doesn't rip after two weeks.\"\n\n\"Optimism,\" Samantha mutters. \"Dangerous trait in this economy.\"\n\nStill, she's clearly not in a rush to leave. She lingers by the row of demo phones, swiping through home screens like she's trying to convince herself she doesn't care how nice they feel.\n\nMeanwhile, Luke is practically drooling over a gaming laptop, pressing random keys on laptops like maybe, just maybe, one of them will unlock a secret discount.\n\nThen you hear it—just behind you, near the service counter.\n\n\"Wait, a hundred dollars? Just to unlock it?\" a woman says, her voice thick with disbelief. She's probably in her sixties, dressed in soft beige with a matching purse clutched to her chest. Her phone is in her hand, the screen locked tight. \"My grandson just typed the password wrong too many times. That's all that happened.\"\n\nThe employee she's talking to is a gangly guy in his early twenties, wearing the store's sleek black polo. He doesn't look up from his tablet as he replies, \"That's standard policy, ma'am. The reset process requires a technician's assistance. It's one hundred dollars for the service.\"\n\nSamantha tilts her head, eavesdropping with zero shame. \"Wow,\" she says under her breath. \"They're really gonna charge her for something the phone would fix on its own if she just waited like ten minutes.\"\n\nYou glance over, watching the older woman frown, clearly unsure whether to believe him. There's a sharp pang in your chest—an awareness of just how confusing tech can be.\n\n\"Think we should say something?\" you whisper.\n\n\"Nah,\" Samantha mutters. \"If I ever end up paying a hundred bucks for a password delay, put me out of my misery.\"\n\nLuke leans over to look at her screen. \"You'd never get scammed like that. You'd bite the employee before you let them get away with it.\"\n\n\"Damn right I would,\" Samantha says.\n\nShe doesn't say it out loud, but the way she glances back at the older woman—with a tiny crease between her brows—makes it clear she's a little bothered by it. She always acts too cool to care, but it's moments like this that give her away.\n\nYou could help her, or you could mind your own business.\n\n[Choice: Help the lady]\n[Choice: Don't help the lady]",

She looks completely lost.\n\n The employee in front of her isn't helping either. He just leans on the counter, tablet in hand, delivering his lines like he's said them a thousand times. \"Yes, ma'am, a technician reset starts at a hundred dollars. It's the standard service fee. There's really no way around it.\"\n\n You walk forward before you can talk yourself out of it.\n\n \"Excuse me,\" you say, stepping up beside the woman. She looks up, startled.\n\n \"Sorry to interrupt,\" you add quickly, voice gentler now. \"But I think you might not need to pay for that.\"\n\n The employee straightens. \"I'm sorry—can I help you with something?\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, brushing past him slightly to tilt the woman's phone toward you. The screen is dimmed, but you tap the power button. A message appears: eyeFone is disabled. Try again in 52 minutes.\n\n \"See?\" you tell her, turning the phone back around so she can see for herself. \"It's just locked from too many password attempts. But after a while, it lets you try again. You don't need a reset and you definitely don't need to pay a hundred bucks.\"\n\n The woman blinks down at her phone. \"Oh. I... didn't know that. I thought I'd broken it.\"\n\n \"You didn't,\" you say, smiling. \"It's built to do this. It's just being cautious.\"\n\n The employee frowns, stepping forward. \"Look, you're not authorized to give tech advice in this store.\"\n\n You glance at him. \"And you're not authorized to lie to people just to make money.\"\n \n \"This isn't your business,\" he warns, jaw tightening.\n\n \"She was literally about to pay you a hundred bucks for something she can do by waiting an hour,\" you say, a little sharper now. \"How is that not anyone's business?\"\n\n The woman's voice cuts in, tentative but firm. \"Is he right?\"\n\n The employee opens his mouth, closes it again, then shrugs. \"If you want to wait...\"\n\n She gives him a look like she sees through him now. \"I do.\"\n\n And then she turns to you, eyes warmer than they were a minute ago. \"Thank you, dear. I really thought I'd messed something up.\"\n\n \"No problem,\" you say, waving it off. \"I'm just glad I could help.\"\n\n But before you can step away, she's digging through her purse. \"No, no, wait a second.\" She pulls out her wallet, flips it open, and presses a crisp fifty-dollar bill into your hand. \"Take this. Please. You saved me a ton of money.\"\n\n \"I—really, you don't have to—\"\n\n \"I insist,\" she says with the kind of resolve only grandmothers carry. \"Better it goes to someone honest than into this place's pockets. I'll be leaving a one-star review on that site my daughter's always talking about.\"\n\n You can't help but laugh. \"Thank you. That's really kind of you.\"\n\n She pats your arm before walking out of the store, her phone still cradled in her hands.\n\n The moment she's gone, the employee glares at you. \"You need to leave. Now. All of you. Before I call security.\"\n\n You turn and head toward the exit, finding Luke and Samantha already waiting.\n\n As soon as you step out into the mall's main walkway, the glass doors gliding shut behind you, Samantha claps you on the back.\n\n \"Well,\" she says, \"we're officially banned from the Tech Palace of Greed.\"\n\n She raises an eyebrow at the fifty-dollar bill in your hand. \"But at least you're fifty bucks richer. I'd say it evens out.\"\n\n \"Yeah,\" you say, tucking it into your pocket. \"Not a bad trade.\"\n\n Luke's eyes go wide. \"Wait, she paid you?\"\n\n \"Technically I saved her a hundred.\"\n\n He grins. \"Dude, we should visit every scammy tech store in this mall. You could be, like... the Tech Whisperer. We'd be rich.\"\n\n \"No more of this,\" Samantha groans.\n\n You chuckle, letting the noise of the mall fold back in around you as the three of you wander off toward your next stop.\n\n \n \n \n You glance away, jaw tight. The employee's smug, rehearsed tone sticks in your head like a splinter, but you don't move. Something about the situation twists in your gut. It's wrong. Predatory, even. But your feet stay planted.\n\n You tell yourself it's not your place. That stepping in might make things worse. That you don't work here, you're just someone poking around the demo stations. And maybe that's true. But still, you feel the weight of it as the older woman slowly pulls out her wallet, her fingers hesitant.\n\n \"Guess she just paid a hundred bucks to lose all her photos,\" Luke mutters under his breath.\n\n You don't answer.\n\n You pretend to keep browsing, dragging your eyes across glowing displays and sleek screens you can't afford. But the excitement's gone now. Every polished surface feels cold. You pass a shelf of overpriced wireless chargers and can't help but picture that lady walking out later with a plastic bag and a wiped phone—and no idea she could've just waited it out.\n\n You leave the store a moment later, the automatic doors sliding shut behind you with a whoosh. Even as the noise of the mall picks back up, you find yourself glancing back once.\n\n You could've said something. You're not sure what, but something.\n\n The thought lingers as you fall in step with your friends. It doesn't weigh heavy exactly, but it stays.\n \n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "Bad Ending #1 Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \nYou had the choice. The chance to go with them, to experience something new, to be part of a memory that might have shaped your life in ways you couldn't yet understand.\n\nBut in the end, you said no.\n\n\"I don't really feel like going, now that I think about it.\"\n\n\"Come on, [name], it'll be fun!\" Samantha had groaned, exasperated. \"It's literally the first day of school. What else are you gonna do, sit in your room all night?\"\n\n\"Yeah, man, it's tradition!\" Luke had added, ever the optimist. \"Gotta start the year off right.\"\n\nBut you had just shrugged. \"You guys go ahead. I'll just chill at home.\"\n\nAnd that was that.\n\nSamantha had rolled her eyes, calling you 'boring as hell' before she and Luke left without you. They were still joking when they walked away, still caught up in the excitement, their voices fading into the distance as you turned back toward home.\n\nThe festival carried on without you.\n\nThe evening passed in the most unremarkable way possible. You scrolled through your phone, bouncing between apps without really looking at anything. Watched some videos you didn't care about. Played a game, but quit halfway through.\n\nAround nine, you thought about texting Luke and Samantha to see how things were going, but you stopped yourself. If they were having fun, would they even answer?\n\nYou turned off your phone and went to bed early, feeling strangely restless.\n\nAnd that was that.\n\nSchool moved forward like it always did. Luke and Samantha talked about the Autumn Festival for a few days—the games, the rides, the food. They laughed about how Samantha had beaten Luke at pumpkin bowling and how weird the fortune teller had been.\n\n\"You should've been there, [name],\" Luke had said, nudging you. \"That seer was kinda creepy, but it would've been funny to see her read your future.\"\n\n\"Yeah, she probably would've told you some cryptic bullshit and you'd be paranoid for a week,\" Samantha had added with a smirk.\n\nYou had just shrugged.\n\n\"Maybe next time.\"\n\nBut there wasn't a next time.\n\nThe festival became another thing in the past, forgotten as the school year pressed on. Homework piled up. College applications loomed. You hung out with Luke and Samantha less often, though at first, you barely noticed.\n\nThey still invited you to things sometimes—group hangouts, movie nights—but you said no more often than not. Maybe you were tired. Maybe you didn't feel like going out. Maybe some part of you assumed they'd always be around, so missing one or two nights didn't really matter.\n\nBut slowly, the invitations stopped.\n\nGraduation came and went.\n\nYou and Luke and Samantha promised to stay in touch.\n\n\"Dude, we'll always be friends,\" Luke had said, slinging an arm around your shoulder at the graduation party. \"No matter what.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Samantha had agreed, raising her cup. \"We'll make time, obviously.\"\n\nAt first, you did.\n\nThere were messages, group calls, even the occasional visit when you were all home for the holidays. But things got busier. People got caught up in their own lives. The messages became fewer, the calls shorter.\n\nOne day, you opened your phone and saw that the last text in the group chat was from months ago. You started typing a message, but after staring at the screen for a few seconds, you deleted it and put your phone down.\n\nYou told yourself you'd reach out later.\n\nBut you didn't.\n\nAnd then, there were the people you never met.\n\nThere was a day, sometime during senior year, when Jessica had stopped in front of your desk, her arms crossed, an unreadable look in her blue eyes.\n\n\"[name],\" she had said, tilting her head slightly. \"Why do you always look so... unbothered? Like nothing ever touches you?\"\n\nYou had no idea what she meant, and you never got the chance to find out. Because instead of answering, instead of asking why she cared, you just shrugged and said something dismissive.\n\nShe never spoke to you again.\n\nYears later, you saw her name pop up in articles, in magazine covers. She made it, just like everyone expected. But you weren't part of her story.\n\nYou could have been.\n\nIn the library one afternoon, you caught Vincent struggling to reach a book on the top shelf. He had stretched onto the tips of his toes, his fingers barely brushing the spine before the book slipped out of reach and thudded to the ground.\n\nYou had the chance to help. To say anything.\n\nBut you didn't.\n\nYou had picked up the book, handed it to him with a nod, and walked away without another word.\n\nMaybe, in another life, you had sat across from him at the library table, listening to him ramble about his favorite novels. Maybe, in another life, you had noticed how his face lit up when he talked about things he loved, how his voice softened when he got lost in thought.\n\nBut you never got to know him. And he never got to know you.\n\nYou passed Aurora in the hallway once, near the end of the year. She had looked right at you, her gaze sharp and knowing, like she saw something no one else did.\n\n\"You should have gone,\" she had murmured under her breath as you walked past.\n\nYou had no idea what she meant.\n\nBut sometimes, on sleepless nights, the words haunted you.\n\nThere was always a distance between you and Jordan. He was the type of guy everyone knew but no one really got close to.\n\nBut there was a moment—one fleeting, insignificant moment—where you could have changed that.\n\nIt was after gym class. He had sat beside you on the bench, running a hand through his sweat-damp hair.\n\n\"You ever feel like... I dunno. Like you're doing everything right, but it still doesn't feel like enough?\"\n\nIt had been an opening. A rare, unguarded moment.\n\nBut you had shrugged, said something vague, and left.\n\nAnd that was the last real conversation you ever had.\n\nLife moved on.\n\nYou had a job. An apartment. A routine.\n\nWake up. Work. Go home. Eat dinner. Sleep. Repeat.\n\nIt wasn't bad, exactly. Just... empty.\n\nSomewhere along the way, you stopped expecting anything else.\n\nYou went through the motions, years passing by in quiet succession. You made some friends at work, but it was different—nothing like the friendship you had in high school, nothing like the bond you'd had with Luke and Samantha.\n\nOnce in a while, you'd come across an old picture of the three of you, buried somewhere in your phone. Maybe from sophomore year, maybe from middle school, maybe from a random day you'd already half-forgotten.\n\nAnd sometimes, late at night when you couldn't sleep, you'd check social media and see a post from Luke or Samantha. They were still close. Still going on trips, still making stupid inside jokes in their captions that you didn't understand anymore.\n\nYou'd hover over the like button, or maybe even think about leaving a comment.\n\nBut you never did.\n\nWhat would you even say?\n\nWould they even care?\n\nYou told yourself it was fine. That this was life. People drift apart. Not everyone keeps their high school friends forever.\n\nBut sometimes, in those rare, quiet moments of introspection, you felt it—a weight in your chest, something small but persistent, whispering that maybe things weren't supposed to turn out this way.\n\nMaybe you had made the wrong choice that night.\n\nMaybe everything would have been different.\n\nMaybe you would have been different.\n\nBut you would never know.\n\nBecause you never went to the Autumn Festival.\n\nAnd that was that.\n\n[Choice: Bad Ending #1 — A Life Unchanged]",

      "text": "Bad Ending #2 Achievement Unlocked! \n \n \nThat night, you stare at your reflection longer than usual.\n\nThe bathroom light flickers once, casting a brief shimmer across the mirror. You don't move. Just stand there, toothbrush in hand, watching the way your face doesn't change.\n\nYour jaw still looks sharp. Your shoulders still broad. Your eyes are tired. You lean closer and turn your face one way, then the other. You try to see what Aurora saw when she looked at you.\n\nBut you don't see anything.\n\nJust you.\n\nStill you.\n\nSame voice. Same name. Same excuses.\n\nYou brush your teeth. Wash your face. Go through the routine like it's armor. You pretend that if you do it well enough, the rest of the day won't catch up to you.\n\nThen you turn off the light.\n\nYour reflection fades into the dark.\n\nYou lie in the bed that night, staring up at the ceiling. You tell yourself none of this matters and that you'll keep going. Whatever this feeling is, you'll move forward.\n\nAnd you do.\n\nJust... not toward anything.\n\nThe days pass.\n\nThey blur, really.\n\nHomecoming ends. The decorations come down. Spirit fades from the halls like smoke. The world settles back into its usual rhythm. But you? You double down.\n\nYou start waking up earlier because it takes time now to make sure nothing you do, nothing you wear, nothing you are gives the curse even a whisper of a reason to change you.\n\nYou avoid soft clothes. No more oversized sweaters, no more fleece-lined jackets. You stop using the nice-smelling body wash in the shower and switch back to the old, harsh one your dad uses. You flatten your tone when you speak. You square your shoulders when you walk. You rehearse your laugh so it sounds lower. You stop brushing your hair the way you like, just running your hands through it roughly.\n\nYou don't let any part of you get mistaken for delicate.\n\nYou even avoid smiling, because you hate how your face looks when you do.\n\nBecause every time you let your guard down, every time you even lean toward something soft, the curse pushes. Something changes. Subtle, but permanent. Your reflection shifts in ways you don't have words for.\n\nYou hate it.\n\nBecause it feels right, and that's unbearable. It doesn't feel like you're becoming someone else, it feels like remembering.\n\nYou're caught in a quiet kind of limbo—frozen between who you've been and who you can't let yourself become.\n\nEvery day feels like a balancing act. You keep your nails short, not because it matters, but because letting them grow would feel like giving something up. You flinch when people compliment your skin. They say it looks smooth, or soft, or different lately. They say it to be kind, but it cuts deeper than they could ever know.\n\nBecause if they see something changing, then it's real. Then you're losing.\n\nYou don't look in mirrors anymore unless you have to. Just enough to make sure you haven't slipped too far, haven't crossed some invisible line. Still the same jaw. Still broad in the shoulders. Still passable. Still a man. You say it like a prayer in your head.\n\nStill a man.\n\nStill a man.\n\nStill a man.\n\nBut the longer you say it, the more it sounds like a lie. Like something you're clinging to because it's all you've ever known.\n\nAnd the worst part is—you can feel her. The girl. Not a hallucination or a stranger in your body. No, she's always been there. You catch her in fleeting moments you wish you could forget. When your laugh is too high and real. When your eyes go soft at something beautiful. When you move your hands in a delicate way. She's in your voice when you forget to keep it low. She's in your thoughts when you imagine being seen and not tolerated. She's the part of you that aches at the end of every day.\n\nAnd still, you deny her. You silence her. Because you're terrified she might be right. You tell yourself that letting her in would mean losing everything. Your name, your body, your safety, your place in the world. You tell yourself that transforming, that giving into the curse, would be surrender. But deep down, you know that it would've been the bravest thing you ever did.\n\nYou tell yourself that holding the line—gritting your teeth and staying the same—is strength. That it's what men do. What you're supposed to do.\n\nBut you're not holding the line.\n\nNot really.\n\nYou're just holding her back.\n\nAnd you feel it more every day—the way she sinks deeper inside, not fading or angry, but just tired. Tired of being locked away in the dark while you pretend not to feel her screaming. You keep walking forward and going through the motions.\n\nBut part of you knows: you're not walking toward anything. You're just walking away from her.\n\nThe truth is that you're not afraid she'll take over.\n\nYou're afraid that you'll love her.\n\nAnd that maybe—if you ever let yourself become her—you wouldn't want to go back.\n\nAnd maybe that's what hurts the most.\n\nBecause you could have had her. A life that fit. A name that made sense. A face that smiled for real. People who would have seen you, known you, loved you for the first time.\n\nThe real you.\n\nBut you chose silence.\n\nYou chose to stay still.\n\nAnd she waits, still there behind your eyes, wondering why you never reached back.\n\nYears later, the curse is gone.\n\nIt went away after senior year ended, just as Madame Serena said it would.\n\nNow, you wake up with stubble you have to shave every morning. Your jaw is heavier, your brow deeper. Your body is solid and broad and unmistakably masculine. When you speak, your voice rumbles in your chest. You fill out shirts the way you were supposed to. People call you \"sir\" without hesitation. No one looks twice.\n\nIt's everything you thought you wanted.\n\nAnd yet, every night, without fail, you lie awake staring at the ceiling, replaying every choice you didn't make.\n\nYou think about what it might've felt like to try. To say yes instead of maybe. To walk the line instead of hiding from it. To laugh and mean it. To wear softness without apology. To cry and let it change you. To pick a name that felt like home. To be brave enough to lose something and gain yourself.\n\nYou wonder what it would've felt like to be her.\n\nNot as a fantasy or a daydream but as a truth you lived in fully.\n\nYou came so damn close, too. You think about Luke, about Samantha, about Jessica and Vincent, about Aurora and Jordan. You think about who you were around them. You felt like maybe—just maybe—you could be something more.\n\nBut you weren't ready.\n\nOr maybe you were and you were just too scared.\n\nYou should be doing well. Your home is quiet. Your life is stable. You have a job and a routine. You're doing well in every way that should matter.\n\nBut sometimes, in the reflection of a mirror or the dark glass of your phone screen, you catch the shape of someone you used to imagine.\n\nAnd you can't help but cry for what you lost.\n\nThe curse never needed to punish you, [name].\n\nYou did that yourself every time you told her no.\n\n[Choice: Bad Ending #2 — The Girl in the Mirror]",

If you kept holding onto the version of yourself that everyone else expects, never reaching for the one you know is waiting underneath.\n\nIn this path, [name] never truly lets the curse in—not because he doesn't feel it, but because he feels it too much. He pushes it down and avoids anything that might trigger change. He convinces himself that this is strength and that staying the same is surviving.\n\nBut surviving isn't living.\n\nThe version of [name] we see here isn't monstrous or cruel or broken. He's not lonely like in Bad Ending #1 — A Life Unchanged. He's just stuck. And maybe that hurts more.\n\nSo many trans women know this version of the story too well. The almost. The lost years. The ache that never really goes away.\n\nI wrote this ending not to say this is what happens if you don't transition. I don't want to strike fear into your heart or pressure you into doing something you don't want to do. Not every path is the same. But I did want to show how deep the pain can go when you spend your entire life telling yourself no.\n\nThe thing many of you are afraid of isn't being someone else.\n\nIt's being yourself.\n\nThis ending is for those who stayed still. For the ones who missed their moment or think they did.\n\nAnd in the small chance that you see yourself in this?\n\nPlease know that your story doesn't have to end here. It's never too late to reach for her.\n\nI promise you she's still here and she's still waiting.",

You didn't pretend to want something you didn't.\n\nYou were honest, and that mattered.\n\nThe cold months came quickly. Snow clung to the edges of the parking lot. Spirit week ended. You focused on the parts of your life that you knew were real—your friends, your schoolwork, the feel of crisp air in your lungs after a long day.\n\nBut what saved you, in the end, wasn't denial. It was magic.\n\nYou started training with Amber. Real lessons about focus and control. You learned how to feel the energy of the curse—not just resist it, but understand it. You saw how it tried to root itself in vulnerability, identity, and uncertainty. But you knew who you were. You were [name] Yoon. A cisgender man. And with that, the curse had nothing to build on.\n\nYou wielded that knowledge like armor.\n\nWhen the final ritual came, it wasn't flashy. No glowing symbols or thunderclaps.\n\nJust a mirror and the truth.\n\nYou looked into your own reflection and didn't see doubt. You saw a boy—still just a high school senior, still tired and figuring life out—but solid. Real. Whole.\n\nAnd the magic broke.\n\nYou graduated. Life moved on.\n\nThe world didn't crumble when the curse lifted. You didn't wake up with wings or a tail or a rewritten past. You were still you. Still masculine. Still very much cis.\n\nAnd it felt... right.\n\nYou went off to college. Got a dorm. A roommate who didn't ask questions. You texted Luke, visited Samantha, even saw Aurora once more—she didn't say much, but gave you a long look, like she knew everything that didn't get spoken out loud.\n\nThen the years started to blur together.\n\nYou graduated. Got a job. A place of your own. A quiet kind of rhythm settled in, steady and unremarkable. But somehow, kind of beautiful. You met someone—her. The one who made you laugh when you didn't want to, who challenged you, matched you, chose you. You got married on a spring afternoon when the sky was so blue it looked fake, and your hands didn't stop shaking until you held hers.\n\nNot long after that, you had a son. Then a daughter. Two tiny, loud, stubborn people who call you Dad and turn your house into a fortress of blankets, plastic dinosaurs, and spilled milk. You're tired all the time now—but it's a good kind of tired. One you wouldn't trade for anything.\n\nIt's a lazy Sunday afternoon. The kind where time moves slower and the sun pours in through the kitchen window. The type of day that feels perfect.\n\nYour daughter is curled up on the living room rug, her hair messy as she hums quietly to herself. She gives dramatic voices to the animal-shaped crayons she refuses to use because they're \"too powerful.\" Your son is in your lap, small and wriggly, holding a toy spaceship and explaining the entire plot of his imaginary saga for the third time this week.\n\nAnd your wife is standing over by the stove, smiling as she watches the chaos unfold, her hair tucked behind one ear and her hands still dusted with flour. She made pancakes this morning just because your daughter asked for them in a cute voice.\n\nShe catches your eye. The smile softens into something warmer.\n\nYou smile back.\n\nAnd for just a flicker of a second—maybe it's the smell of lavender from the candle on the counter, or the sunlight catching your daughter's face just so, or the fact that your son has started talking about a seer—you remember.\n\nYou remember the curse.\n\nYou don't really think about the curse anymore. You hadn't in years. Not since college. Not since the last conversation you had with Amber. It was another life. Another story.\n\nThe weight of the thing. The pull. The way it asked you to change, to surrender, to become something you weren't sure you could name. You remember how damn close it came. The edge you stood on, looking into a future that wanted to reshape you from the inside out.\n\nAnd you wonder, just for the briefest of seconds—what would've happened if you let it?\n\nMaybe, in some other world, there's a different you. Someone who let go. Who changed. Who became someone else—someone softer, someone still brave, just in a different way.\n\nBut then your daughter calls your name, giggling as she throws a crayon at your leg. Your son demands you lift him very high so he can pretend he's flying. Your wife walks over, laughing as she gently tousles your hair and kisses your cheek without a word.\n\nAnd everything else fades.\n\nBecause this is real. This is the life you built. The love you held onto. The future you chose.\n\nAnd there's not a single version of you that would give this up.\n\nNot even for the chance to know what else could've been.\n\nBecause this? This is everything.\n\n[Choice: Neutral Ending #1 — The Life I Made]",

First off, I want to thank you for playing all the way through this path. That said, this route—the one where [name] resists the curse, stays masculine, and lives a cisgender life—was never meant to be what A Mirror's Curse is about. The game was designed as a story about identity, transformation, and discovering parts of yourself. It's a transgender transformation narrative, and the game is built to explore those feelings.\n\nBut identity is complex. Not every player is here for the same reasons. This route exists and was supported until now to give you a choice.\n\nHowever, routes like this come with costs. Art, writing, testing, branching, all of it adds up quick. And when those resources are spent on a path that goes against the themes of the game, it becomes impossible to justify continuing it.\n\nSo this is where this path ends.\n\nThis ending isn't a failure or a punishment. It's a neutral ending, not a bad ending. This narrative, unfinished and oddly placed as it is, is about an [name] who chose to stand still and make a life he could love.\n\nThe truth is, the best life isn't the one magic tries to hand you. It's the one you make. And whether that life is trans or cis or somewhere in between—what matters is that you chose it.\n\nThanks for walking this path.",

The head of your penis begins to flatten and fold inward upon itself, forming a new shape. The shaft continues to retract, merging seamlessly with your body as it disappears. In its place, two delicate lips emerge, tender and sensitive. These lips part slightly to reveal a new opening. Nestled above this, your testicles ascend and merge into your sensitive clitoris. All around, your pubic region reshapes itself to accommodate this. The entire process is disorienting and fascinating, leaving you with an entirely different set of genitalia. \n\n[Choice: Return]",

There are a bunch of links below if you enjoyed this game and want to see more.\n\nFirst, the Discord! There is a Discord for this game. It's pretty small right now, but if you want to chat with me or suggest things, the link is [here.]\n\nSecondly, the Patreon. The Patreon currently does NOT have version 0.02. However, when version 0.02 is released, it'll be released on Patreon first and be exclusive there for a month before its public release. If you support the game, I would appreciate it a lot.

I commissioned an artist to make a custom character avatar that'll change according to the transformations you choose. So I hope you all are ready for that. The artist said they would try and finish by the end of October, so the update introducing art will probably come out somewhere in the middle of November.\n\nLastly, I just want to thank all of you for your overwhelming support of this game.

I wanted the final scene to be one where you're forced to confront your parents. However, this has a LOT of different possibilities depending on a ton of factors. For example, whether you've told your mom, whether you've told your dad, and whether you told Lily. This encounter will probably be very long, and I felt it was good to push this to the next update.\n\nAlso, the next update will be focused on feminization aspects more! I know there hasn't been a transformation point in like 36k words, and some of you may not be a fan of that. The next update will heavily focus on the cheerleading route and giving you a preview of what that's like. And of course, that'll come with multiple transformation points and a ton of chances to feminize your [name] even more.\n\nThe final thing I have to say is that hip transformations will be added to the paperdoll! A generous donor on the Discord server, Nightwhisper, gave me a substantial sum of money to add hip transformations to be visible on the paperdoll.

Some unexpected personal issues involving my family have come up, and I'm going to have to take on a massive financial burden to make sure we stay afloat. I won't lie, things are looking pretty rough, and we're trying to hold on until May. Until then though, money will be tight.\n\nI know this Patreon has been doing well, and I'm beyond grateful for all the support so far. However, any donations would be massively helpful. If you've ever considered contributing a few extra dollars, now would be the perfect time. Every bit counts, and it would mean the world to me.\n\nI'm going to keep commissioning as much art as I can. I know you all love to see the project grow and the game's visual appeal is part of why it's been doing so well. But things might slow down a bit since I need to prioritize taking care of the people I care about. I'll do my best to balance everything, but making sure my family and I can get through this comes first. I hope you all understand!\n\nAnd now, back to our regularly scheduled programming.\n\nThis update was either a pretty small one or had no new content whatsoever if you're not interested in being the spectator variant of the game. I'm very excited for the next update, which will be the magic update. You will get to spend time with Aurora and Milo learning about how magic works and how good you are at it.\n\nAlso, a lot of the earlier parts of the game will be reworked to make the characters more consistent and make it better in general. I already went through quite a few passages this update to improve the writing.\n\nPlease consider joining the Discord or Patreon! Again, the Patreon helps me work on this game a lot more and afford art. The survey also helps a lot for me to determine what you all like and dislike about the game.\n\nThe link to the Discord is [here.]\n\nThe link to the Patreon is [here.] Patrons get one month early access to releases starting from the 10 USD tier.\n\nThe link to the Ko-Fi is [here.] I would appreciate donations if you have money you can spare.\n \nThe link to the survey is [here.]",

I hope this helps bring them more depth and attention!\n\nIf you check the menu, I also added a ton with the help of -=Camille=-, a full stack developer who offered to help with this game. The gallery was added and so was the paperdoll widget, which you may have noticed. If you haven't noticed, please check it out! It's really cool, I promise.\n\nI also added a widget to view the stats whenever you want, made save compatibility significantly better, and reworked the credits.\n\nI hope you all enjoy!

Whether you've embraced the magic, resisted it, or found yourself unsure, your decisions have begun shaping [name]'s path in ways both subtle and profound. This week served as a foundation for the rest of the game. An opportunity to familiarize yourself with many aspects of the game.\n\nAs we move forward, things will only grow more complex. The stakes will rise, the transformations will deepen, relationships will advance, and [name]'s world will open up in ways you may not expect. Remember, your choices matter. You get to influence [name]'s relationships, identity, and ultimate fate. The power to determine [name]'s future is in your hands.\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what the game has to offer so far, and will stick around for more.\n\nMuch love,\n\namaty\n\n[Choice: Continue]",

      "text": "Hello, this is a quick choice regarding how much adult content you want in this game. I thought about this for a while, considering my own thoughts on having adult content and the survey results. Approximately half of you wanted adult content in A Mirror's Curse, and I felt that figure was way too high to ignore. However, the other half was ambivalent to the thought of adult content. I decided the best compromise would be to ask how much adult content the player wants.\n\nFor week 2, there will not be too much adult content. This choice will mostly just affect how [name] reacts to their boobs if you decide to get them. There may be a masturbation scene, but there won't be any sex until later on. I believe this is the best way to respect what everyone wants for this game. A moderate amount of adult content involves sex scenes, masturbation, and general adult scenes. A small amount of adult content will entail masturbation and general adult scenes but no sex. No adult content, as promised, will involve no adult content whatsoever.\n\n[Choice: I want a moderate amount of adult content]\n[Choice: I want a small amount of adult content]\n[Choice: I want no amount of adult content]",
